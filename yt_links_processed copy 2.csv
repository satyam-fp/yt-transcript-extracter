https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leuKvqbYyiY,Procedural Stylized Wireframe Material (Blender Tutorial),"The tutorial demonstrates how to create a stylized wireframe material in Blender, which can be used to add a techy effect to models like cars or in abstract/sci-fi renders. The wireframe shader is stylized and does not reflect the actual mesh topology. The video covers creating two versions of the material: a wireframe emission that emits light and a base wireframe with customizable colors, thickness, and noise effects. The tutorial also mentions the availability of these materials for purchase and provides information on a broader material pack and additional resources for learning procedural material creation in Blender.","In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural, stylized wireframe material in Blender. So this material could be really useful, for example, adding it onto a car model to kind of add a cool techy effect to the spinning car. You could also add it to other abstract or sci-fi renders. Now this wireframe shader doesn't actually show the correct topology of the mesh. You can see here's the actual topology of the mesh. Now the monkey does have a subdivision surface modifier, but you can see the wireframe shader is going to add these triangles here in the faces. So if you want to learn how to render proper wireframe images, then you can check out this other video which I made, and I'll have the link to that in the description. But this is more of a stylized, kind of futuristic wireframe effect that you can add to objects. Now we're going to be creating two different versions. So the first version is a wireframe emission, so the wireframe is actually going to emit light. And the other one here is just this base wireframe, which you can change the custom colors. So we have this base color here, and we also have the roughness of the material. And then we also have this cool wireframe thickness, so you can make it thicker or thinner depending on what you're working on. And then we also have the wireframe brightness for the emission, because it's emitting light. And then we also have the wireframe color, which is that emission color. Then we also have this cool noise value here. So if I turn up this noise amount, you can see there's going to be bits of noise where the wireframe disappears. And then we have the noise scale. We also have the detail level of the noise. And then we also have the roughness value of the noise. And then also noise distortion. So for this one, again, we have the base color. We also have the wireframe color. Then we also have the roughness of the material. And then again, we have the wireframe thickness. And then again, we have similar noise values. So we have the noise amount. And then we have the scale. We also have the detail. We also have the roughness. And then also the distortion. And if you'd like to purchase these procedural materials, you can get them with the links in the description. And you can also purchase all of my procedural materials by checking out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my procedural materials pre-set up for Blender's asset browser, with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. Now, every time I create another 10 procedural materials, I update the Ultimate Material Pack with all of my new materials. And so I've just finished these next materials. So these materials have just been added to my Ultimate Procedural Material Pack. And to learn how to create more materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I just went to the Add menu, and I just added a monkey head. And I scaled it down by a 0.2. And then hit Ctrl-A and just applied the scale. Then I hit Ctrl-1 to add a subdivision surface with one level. And I'll make the viewport and render levels both 1. And then I'll just shade it smooth. Then I'll move this over here and duplicate it so we have two different monkeys to preview both materials. Let's set up the lighting. So if I go here to the World Properties, I'm going to be adding in this Machineshop02 HDRI from polyhaven.com. So if you want to download it, the link is in the description. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on this yellow dot here next to Color. And you can choose Environment Texture. And then just click on the Open button and open up the HDRI. And I went up here to the Render Properties, and I opened up the Film tab. And I just checkmarked the Transparent button so you can't see the HDRI in the background. And then also here on the Color Management, I'm using AGX and Very High Contrast to make the colors more contrasted. So let's click over here to go to the Shading workspace. And I'll just select the first monkey head. I'll go into the Rendered Viewport mode. And then I'll click on New here to add a new material in the Shader Editor. And I'll just call this Wireframe Emission. We're going to be creating the Emission wireframe first. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So you can click here on Edit, and you can go to the Preferences. And then you go to the Add-ons tab, and just search for Node, and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on. So I'm going to start by making this a dark blue color. And if you want to use the same exact hex value, you can punch in this hex value right here. I'm just going to make it a nice dark blue color. Then I'm going to turn the Roughness down, so I'll just turn the Roughness down to like a 0.2, so it's kind of shiny. Now the main node that we're going to use to create this effect is the Wireframe node. So if you go to the Add menu, you can add the Wireframe node. And if I Ctrl-Shift and select the Wireframe, I can preview it. What I'm going to do is open up the Emission here, and I'm going to put the Factor into the Strength. And then I'll Ctrl-Shift-Select the Principled Shader to preview it. So now wherever the Wireframe is, that is going to make it an Emission. And then I can also drag this Size here down, so I can make it smaller. But you can see it's really hard to drag this value, because the value is so sensitive. So to make the Size less sensitive, so it's easier to change the Size, I'm going to search for a Math node. And we'll put the Math node here behind the Wireframe. And the value is going to go into the Size, so we're replacing that value. Now here on the Type here, I'm going to change it to Divide. So now on the top value, I'll turn it to 1. And on the bottom value, I'm going to turn it to 1000. So this way, we can now use the top value, and I can drag it back and forth. And you can see we can very easily have more customizable control over the size of it. Now the Wireframe shader is going into the Strength of the Emission. And so we don't actually have any value to change the brightness. So what I'm going to do is click on the Divide, and I'll duplicate it and stick it here. And then instead of Divide, I'm going to change it to Multiply instead. And then on this value here, I'll just turn it to a 1 on default. But now I can turn this value, and that's going to multiply the color values. And so it's going to make it brighter and brighter. So we can use this in the Custom node group to make the emission brighter. And then of course, if you want to, right here on the color, on the Emission color, you can change the emission color right there. But I'll just leave it as a white color. So now I want to add that cool noise effect so that some parts can be taken away by noise. So I'm just going to search for a noise texture. And we're just going to drop it up here. And then with the noise texture selected, I'll hit Ctrl-T to add the texture coordinate mapping. And I can just delete the mapping. And then let's put the object into the vector. And the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. And let's Ctrl-Shift-Select the noise texture to preview it. And let's now change some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 20. And I'll turn the detail up to 10 so it's pretty detailed. And then I'll turn the roughness up to a 0.6. So I do want to make it more contrasted. So let's go to the Add menu. And I'm just going to search for a color ramp. And let's stick it here after the noise. And for now, I'll just kind of drag these together so it's more contrasty. But we'll be customizing this later. So now what I want to do is I want to mix the color ramp in here with the wireframe. And I want to make it so that where the noise is, the wireframe is going to disappear. So to do this, I'm going to search for a mix color to mix two colors together. So we're going to take the color ramp and put that into the factor. And then the multiply can go into color A. Now here in color B, we can just make this fully black. So now I can take this mix result and I can replace it here for the strength. So now this is going to be the new color. So let's just Ctrl-Shift-Select the principal shader. And now you can see that where the noise is, if I Ctrl-Shift-Select it, you can see like right here, this is really bright. So wherever the noise is going to be really bright, that's where it's going to be disappearing. So I'll just Ctrl-Shift-Select the principal shader just to see that again. Now I do want to customize this a little bit. So what I'm going to do is on the color ramp here, I'm going to drag this over a bit. And then also drag the white tab over a little bit. I like something like that a little bit better. But then also I want to be able to control the visibility of the noise. Because maybe I just don't want to use the noise in some cases. So what I can do is add a hue saturation value node. And we'll put it here after the color ramp. Now the hue saturation value has this value which I can turn up and down. So I'll just Ctrl-Shift-Select it to preview it. So if I turn the value down, it's going to be fully black. So now you can see that it's showing all the wireframe. But if I turn the value up and make it lighter, more and more of it is going to be white. And so more and more of it is going to be disappeared. So I'll turn the value all the way to zero on default. But in the custom node group, we can turn this up to kind of add that cool effect. So now let's join this together into a node group. So I'm going to click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output. And I'll hit Ctrl-G to join it together into a node group. Let's hit Tab to go out of the node group. I'll just drag it over here. Let's make it bigger. And I can copy the material name and add it here into the node group. Let's hit Tab to go into the node group. And I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel. And then if I go over here to the group tab, we have the group sockets. And so I can double click on this to rename it. And I'll just rename it to shader because I like that better. So now we can plug up all the custom values to this group input to control them outside of the node group. So the first value that I want to add is the base color. So we'll drag the group input right over here next to the principled shader. And we'll put the base color. And also let's put the roughness into the extra sockets. Then let's control the wireframe thickness. So I'm going to drag the group input right back here. And this value can control the thickness. So we'll put the value into the extra socket. We'll double click on this to rename it. And I'll just rename that to wireframe thickness. Then to control the wireframe brightness, we have the multiply. So we'll put this into the extra socket. And this one I'm going to rename to wireframe brightness. Then for the wireframe color, we can drag this over here next to the principled shader. And we'll put the color into the extra socket. And you can leave this to emission color. I'm going to call it wireframe color. Or you could call it wireframe emission color. Whatever makes sense for you. Then let's control the noise amount. So I'll drag the group input under the color ramp. And we have this value that we can control how much noise. So we'll put the value into the extra socket. And I'll just rename this to noise amount. Then I want to control the noise settings. So I'll drag the group input back here behind the noise. And I'll put the scale, the detail, the roughness, and the distortion all into the extra sockets. And then if I drag this down, I'm going to copy the word noise here. And then I can paste it here. So we have noise scale, paste it here, noise detail, noise roughness, and noise distortion. So I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. Let's just drag this maybe up here. And I'll hit tab to go out of the node group. And I can just review the material to make sure it's working. So we first have the base color. That's looking good. Then we have the roughness of the material. We also have the wireframe thickness. We have the wireframe brightness. And then also the wireframe color. And then we have the noise amount. So I'll turn this up so I can see the noise. And then I also have the noise scale, the detail, also the roughness, and the distortion. So I'll turn the noise amount back to zero. So that is it for the first material. So I'm now just going to duplicate this material and add it to the other monkey. And we'll be creating another one which is similar but isn't an emission. So just select the other monkey head. We'll click on the dropdown. And we're just going to add the same material. But I now want to duplicate the material so that when we change the settings, it won't affect the other material. So to do this, we need to do two things. First, I'm going to click right here to duplicate the shader or the entire material. So now it says wireframe emission 001. I'm just going to get rid of that so we have just the base wireframe. However, this wireframe node group is the same node group right in here. So if I change the values, it would affect the other material. So I need to click on this 2 icon, click on the 2, and that's going to duplicate it. So it's now separate. And I'm just going to call it wireframe. So let's hit the Tab key to go into the node group. And I'm just going to change some of the settings. So because this material isn't going to be emission, let's go over here to the emission. And I'm going to unplug the color and unplug the strength of the emission. Make sure the strength is turned to 0, and we can just close the emission. Now if I hit the N key to open up the side panel, let's drag this down and make it bigger. We don't want to use the wireframe color, so we'll click on this. This is the emission one. So click on that and then hit the minus to get rid of it. And then we also don't need this multiply because this multiply node here was used to make it brighter. So if I click on the multiply, I'll hit Ctrl-X to get rid of it. So Ctrl-X will get rid of the value but still keep this wire plugged up. So now you can see we have this extra value here, the wireframe brightness. So if I click on the wireframe brightness, we'll hit the minus to get rid of it. Now I also want to get rid of the base color because we're going to be creating 2 separate custom colors. So here in the base color, just click on the base color here and hit the minus to get rid of that as well. So if I just Ctrl-Shift-Select the mix here, you can see this mix color has white and black. For the wireframe in the background. So let's click on the principles shader and we're just going to drag it back here. And then I'll just Ctrl-Shift-Select the principles shader so the viewer isn't in the way. So this mix here, I can put the mix result into the color. So now you can see we have black and white. But I want to create custom colors for this. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm just going to search for another mix color. And we're going to put this here after the first one. Now because this mix result is black and white, we can put it into the factor. And that's going to determine what part is going to be color A and what part is going to be color B. So then I'm going to make 2 different custom colors and I kind of like using these brownish grayish colors. So for color A, I'm going to be using this mid gray color. And you can punch in the hex value if you want to use the same color. And also on color B, this is going to be kind of like a dark brown. And again, you can punch in the same hex value if you want to get the exact same color I'm using. So now just make sure the mix result is going into the base color. Let's just kind of compress these together so it looks a little bit better. So I now want to add those new colors as custom colors. So I'll click on the group input and let's just drag it right up here. We'll zoom in here and I can now take color A, put that into the extra socket. And color B, put that into the extra socket. And let's double click on A and this is going to be the base color because this is the light one. And then here in color B, I'll double click on this to rename it and call it wireframe color. So now I'm going to click on the base color and I'm going to drag it up to the top and let go. So base color is at the top. And then click and drag and drop the wireframe right after that. So you have the base color and wireframe there at the very top. Now let's click on the group input and just drag it back to the very end and let's zoom into the color ramp. And for this material, I actually like the color ramp being more contrasty. I think it just looks better for the noise. So I'm going to drag these values really close to each other, kind of like that, kind of in the middle. So it's going to be more contrasted. So let's hit the tab key to go outside the node group. We'll hit N to close the side panel. And then we still have that viewer node plugged up. So just Ctrl-Shift-Select the principled shader to preview the final thing. So we have the base color of the material. Then we also have the wireframe color. And then we also have the roughness of the material. We also have the wireframe thickness. And then we have the noise amount, so I'll turn up the noise. And then we also have the noise scale, the noise detail, the noise roughness, and the noise distortion. So that's how you create these two procedural stylized wireframe materials. You can also purchase these procedural materials on my Gumroad store and Patreon page. And that's a great way to help support the channel. Now I've just finished creating all of these new materials. So these materials have just been added into my Ultimate Procedural Material Pack. So if you're an existing customer, you can redownload the product files and reinstall it as an asset library to get the updates with these new materials. You can also just purchase this new procedural material pack. So if you're interested in that, link is in the description. And you can also check out my procedural material tutorial playlist to learn how to create many more materials. So I hope you found this helpful, and thank you for watching."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3lyfrWlx3E,Procedural Rubber Materials - Part 2 (Blender Tutorial),"In part two of this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create two procedural rubber materials: the grippy rubber material and the dotted rubber material. The tutorial covers the step-by-step process of setting up these materials, including using various textures, adjusting settings, and creating node groups for easy customization. The video also highlights the availability of purchasing these materials individually or as part of an Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack on platforms like Gumroad, Patreon, and Blender Market. Viewers are encouraged to watch part one for additional context and setup instructions.","Welcome to part two of this two-part tutorial on how to create procedural rubber materials in Blender. So if you haven't seen the first part, definitely check that out with the link in the description. In the first part, we created these two materials. We created the bumpy rubber material and the smooth rubber material. And in this video, we're going to be creating the grippy rubber material and also this dotted rubber material. And if you'd like to purchase these materials to use in your projects, you can get that with the links in the description on my Gumroad store and Patreon page and the Blender Market. And if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials, you can check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my materials pre-set up for Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. So once you've set up my Ultimate Material Pack as an asset library in the Blender, you can just drag and drop the procedural materials into your 3D project. And you can also purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And you can also check out my procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube to learn how to create any of my materials. Now, as far as the 3D setup goes for this 3D scene, if you want to set up the same way that I have, then check out part one. If you haven't watched part one yet, then check that out. And I go over kind of the lighting setup and how I've set up the 3D scene. So let's now make the grippy rubber material. So I'm just going to select this object and I'll duplicate it and I'll just move it right down here. And then if I just select these other objects, I'll hit the H key to hide them just so they're out of the way so the viewport is a bit faster when we're rendering. And then if I select this object here, let's click on the X to get rid of that material. We'll add a new material. And this one will rename to grippy rubber. So let's start by creating the main texture, which is going to go into the base color. So I'll go to the Add menu. We're going to search for a noise texture. We'll drop this here. And with the noise texture selected, I'll hit Control T to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And I'll use the object coordinates and I'll just place the texture coordinate mapping down here and put the noise texture up here. So now I want to Control Shift select the noise texture so I can preview it. And let's change some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 120 and then I'll turn the detail up to a 6. So I want to put the factor into the base color. But before I do that, I want to create some custom colors. So I'll go to the Add menu and I'll search for a mix color. I'll put this after the noise and the factor can go into the factor of the mix. This way we have color A and color B. And so if I change this, that's going to be the custom colors to add some variation to the rubber material. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, you can use the same hex codes. So for color A, this is going to be a gray color and it's going to be six threes. So three, three, three, three, three, three, FF. And the FF, that's just for the alpha, because you can see if I drag this, that's during the alpha. So we want the alpha to be all the way up to one. Then here for color B, this is going to be a very dark gray. And for this one, the hex code is going to be one, nine, one, nine, one, nine, FF. So now I can take this mixed result and I can put that into the base color and let's control shift, select the principled shader to preview it. And then just for now, I'll turn the roughness of it. So it's a bit more rough, but we're going to be adding a value into the roughness later. So now let's create the main texture for the grippy part of the rubber. So I'll go to the Add menu and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture and let's use the same object coordinate. So I'll put the mapping vector into the vector of the Voronoi and I'll control shift select the Voronoi to preview it. And then let's change the settings. So on the F1 here, I'm going to change this to distance to edge. And now if I turn up the scale, you can see we have this cool crack texture. So I'm going to turn the scale to 800. So it's really detailed. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now I want to distort the Voronoi texture with another texture. So I'm going to search for a noise texture and we're going to drop it right here between the mapping and the Voronoi. So you can see it's distorting the Voronoi because it's going through the vector. And let's change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to a 25 and I'll turn the detail up to 6 and leave the other settings how they are. Now if I zoom in here, you can see it's like way too distorted. So I want the noise texture to have less of an effect over the Voronoi. So to do this, we're going to search for a mix color and we're going to drop it here between the noise texture and the Voronoi. And I can unplug this and I'm going to put the factor into color B and then I'm going to take this mapping vector and I'm going to put that into color A. So now this mix is mixing between A, which isn't distorted, and B, which is very distorted. And you can see as I drag this around, the texture is moving around a lot. So we'll click on the mix type here and we'll change it to linear light. And that way, when I drag this around, you can see it's distorting it, but it's not moving around quite so much. And then I'll turn the factor to a 0.02, just a 0.02. So now you can see it looks kind of random and noisy. So that just makes it look a bit more natural. So now this Voronoi texture is going to go into the normal. Let's control shift, select the principle shader. And I first want to add a color ramp to change the colors and make it more contrasted. So I'm going to search for a color ramp. We'll put this here and let's just control shift, select the color ramp to preview it. And the Voronoi distance can go into the factor of the color ramp. So I'm going to drag the white tab way over here and then leave the black tab here. So now you can see it's mostly white. And so basically by dragging this white over, it's making those little black lines a lot more thin. So now I can put the color into the normal and I'll control shift, select the principle shader to preview it. But you can see there's some weird shading issues. It's really dark over here. That's because we need to convert the color data into normal data. So we're going to search for a bump node. We're going to drop this here and the color can go into the height value. And now it's converted to bump data. And I'm going to turn the strength to a really small number of a 0.25, just a 0.25. So if I zoom in here, you can see it just looks a little bit bumpy. So let's click and drag the box like these nodes and I'm going to drag them down and box like these nodes and drag them up because I want to add a roughness value. So what we're going to do is drag this noise texture up here and we're actually going to put the noise texture into the roughness. But what I first want to do is change the colors. So we're going to search for a color ramp, drop this up here and I'll put the factor into the roughness. But then let's take the color ramp and put it in between the noise and the roughness. So now I can take the white tabs and black tabs and turn them up and down to control the roughness values. So on this one here, I'm going to leave it as fully white. Then the black one here, I'm going to turn this up and you can see if I turn it up, it's going to be more rough. And if you want to use the same exact hex code I'm using, this color here is going to be a color of 949494FF there on the hex code. And then also I want to be able to control the roughness values later in the custom node group. So if we just search for a hue saturation value, we can put this in between the color ramp and the principal shader. And we now have this value which I can drag up and down. So that's going to make the values lighter and darker. So that's going to control the roughness values. So that's it for the procedural material. So let's now join it together into a node group. So I'll click and drag the box, select all the nodes, accept the material output, and I'll press Ctrl G to join it together into a node group. And then I'll hit the tab key to outside the node group and I'll drag the node group over here. And let's make it bigger. And I can copy the material name and I can paste it here into the node group. Now also you can see this says BSDF and I want to rename that to shader. So if I go into the node group, I can press the N key to open up the side panel. And if I go here to the group tab and the group sockets, I can double click on this and just rename that to shader. So now on the group input, we can plug up all the custom values. So the mapping is plugged up to all the textures. So this scale will change the size of the entire material. So I'll put the scale and the extra socket. Let's click on the scale and you can see it's three values. But to make it one value, we can click on the type here and change it to float. Now I can turn the default value to one, but the texture is still gone. That's because I need to go tab out of the node group and then I need to turn the scale back to one. So now that's controlling the size of the entire material. So we'll hit tab to go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the colors. So I'll drag the group input right up here and we can take color A and color B and put them into the extra sockets. And then I'll just rename these to color one and two. Then I want to control the roughness. So if I take the heat saturation value, take the value here and put that into the extra socket, I can rename this to roughness. Then I want to control the texture scale. So we'll drag the group input right down here. Now let's take the voronoi and we'll put the scale into the extra socket and I can rename this to texture scale. Then I want to control the texture distortion, which is controlled by this linear light, because if I turn this up and down, it's distorting the texture. So we'll put this into the extra socket and I'll rename that to texture distortion. Let's also add the detail of the voronoi. So put the detail into the extra socket. I'll drag this down here and let's rename it to texture detail. Then I want to control the noise scale and the noise detail. So I'll drag the group input right up here and we have this scale and this detail. So we'll put both of these into the extra sockets. And then I'm just going to call this noise scale and noise detail. And then finally, I want to control the bump strength. So we'll drag the group input right down here. Let's take the strength, put that into the extra socket and I'll rename this to bump strength. So I'll drag the group input right up here and I'll hit the end key to close the side panel and I'll hit the tab key to go outside the node group. So here's the final material. So let's open this up, make it bigger and I can just review the final material. So we have the overall scale of the texture. Then we also have the two different colors. So color one and also color two. And then we also have the roughness to make it more shiny or rough. Then we also have just the texture scale, the texture distortion. We also have the detail. So if I zoom in really close, you can see if I turn up the detail, that's what it's going to look like. And then we also have the noise scale, which is controlling the noise of the color. Then we have the noise detail and then finally the bump strength. So now let's create the last material, which is the dotted rubber. So I'm going to click on the grippy rubber here or click on the object and I'll duplicate it and move it over here. We'll select this object and hit H to hide it. And we'll click on this object here. Let's kind of zoom into it like that. And I'll click on the X here to get rid of this material. Let's add a new material and I can call this dotted rubber. So we're first going to start by making the base color this dark gray color. And if you want to use the same hex value, you can punch in 262626FF. So it's just kind of like a dark gray. And then here on the roughness, I'm going to turn this to a 0.6 so it's a bit more rough. So let's now create the texture for the dots. So I'll go to the add menu and we're going to search for a Voronoi texture. Drop this here and I'll control shift select the Voronoi to preview it. And then also with the Voronoi texture selected, I'll press control T to add the texture coordinate mapping. Now I could use the object coordinates, but if I put the object into the vector, then what I want to do to make it look like dots is I'm going to take the F1 and change it to smooth F1. Now you can see the edges are smooth and then I can turn up the scale. So I'll just turn this down like that. Now if I take the random value here at the bottom and I turn this down to zero, you can see there's a problem here. And that's because this procedural texture has 3D texture space. So you're seeing little slices of these circles in different areas. And that's because this object is three dimensional. And so I wouldn't want to actually use the object coordinates in this case, I'd want to use the UV coordinates instead. So I'm going to put the UV into the vector. So if you're going to use the UV coordinates, you'll just need to make sure you properly UV unwrap your object. So because we're UV unwrapping it, the texture is now laying flat on the faces of the object. So now here on the Voronoi settings, we already changed the smooth F1 and then we already turned the random to zero. But let's turn the scale up to a 200. So the dots are much smaller. So now I want to make the dots more contrasted. So let's search for a color ramp, we'll put this here after the Voronoi. And then I can drag the black tab kind of to about here. And then I'll drag the white tab over to the other side. And I'll just bring it to about there. So now you can see there's these little white circles with black behind it. So we're going to be putting this into the normal to give it some bump. So we'll drag these nodes back here. Let's search for a bump node, we'll drop it down here. So we can first take the color ramp color and put that into the normal. And then if I Ctrl Shift, select the principal shader, you can see there's some weird shading issues. So I need to put the bump here in between the color ramp and the principal. And then the color needs to be going into the height value to convert it to bump data. So now you can see we have some little bumps there on the rubber. And I'm going to turn the bump strength down to like a point four. So it's not quite as bumpy. Now I also want to be able to control the size of the bumps. So let's drag the Voronoi and color ramp back here. And in between these two nodes, I'm going to search for a hue saturation value. And we'll put this right here. So it's after the Voronoi. So the value here, we can drag this up and down. And that is going to make it lighter and darker. So that is going to change the size of each individual little dot there. So then I also want to add a noise texture, which is also going to be going into the bump just to make the surface more bumpy. So let's just search for a noise texture, drop this up here. And I can use the same vector, put that into the vector, the noise, and then I'll Ctrl Shift, select the noise to preview it. And let's change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to 40. And I'll turn the detail to 10. And I'll turn the roughness to a point six. So I now want to go over here to the principal shader and drag this back. And I'm going to take the bump node and I'll duplicate it and drop it here. And we can put the noise texture factor into the height value of this bump. And then let's Ctrl Shift select the principal shader to preview it. So now you can see we're mixing it together because we have two bump nodes. Now that is way too bumpy. So I want to make this much less strong. So I'm going to turn the bump strength just to a point zero six point zero six. So now if I zoom in here, you can see there's just a little bit of bumpiness there on the rubber. And that is it for the procedural material. So let's join together into a new. Now I don't want to put the texture coordinate into the node group because when I add this in my ultimate procedural material pack, I want my customers to know that it's using the UV coordinates. So they'll have to UV unwrap the object if they want to add it onto some object. Or they could also use the object coordinates if they're just using like a flat object. But what I'm going to do is box select all these nodes except the material output and the texture coordinate. I'll hit Ctrl G to join together into a node group. And I'll hit the Tab key to go outside the node group. And we can just drag these nodes together to compress them. Let's also drag this out to make it bigger. And then I can copy the material name and paste it here into the node group. Let's hit the Tab key to go into the node group. And I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel. And here on the group sockets here, I just want to double click on this and rename it to shader because I like that better. So now let's plug up all the custom values. So we'll plug the scale here from the mapping into the extra socket. If we click on the scale, let's click on the type here and change it to float. So it is one value. And then we can turn the default value to one. Let's go out of the node group and turn the scale back to one. And then we can go back into the node group. Now let's also control the base color and the roughness. So I'm going to drag the input over here. And we'll put the base color and the roughness into the extra sockets. Now I also want to control the size of the dots. So we'll drag this back here. And we can take this value from the hue saturation value. I'll put that into the extra socket. And this one I'm going to rename to dot size. Then let's control the dot scale. So we'll put the Voronoi texture scale into the extra socket. And we'll rename this to dot scale. And actually, what I'm going to do is click and drag and drop the dots size after this one. So this one is below it. And then this one I'll rename to dots individual size because that makes more sense. Then I want to control the noise settings. So we'll put the scale and the detail into the extra socket. And I'll call this noise scale and noise detail. And then I want to control the bump strengths. So we'll drag the input right down here. And if we zoom in here, this first one is the dots bump strength. So we'll put this one in the extra socket. Let's rename this one here to dots bump strength. And then the last one here, we'll put the strength into the extra socket. This one, as you can see, is the noise. So I'll put this into the extra socket. And this one I'll rename to noise bump strength. I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. Let's drag the group input right back here. And I can hit tab to go outside the node group. Let's just zoom out here and review the final material. So we have the scale to change the size of the entire material. You can also use the object coordinates if you want to. And let me just show you real quick. If I just add a plane, maybe scale the plane down and apply the scale. If I now add this same material to a flat object here like a plane, you can see using the object coordinates, it actually looks just fine. So if you're adding this to a flat object, you can use the object coordinates. But for an object like this, which is round, I'm going to be using the UV coordinates instead. So we have the scale, then we also have the base color. So I'm just keeping it gray, that makes sense for rubber. Then we have the roughness, we have the dot scale, that's all the dots at once. And then we have the dots individual size. Then we have the noise scale, we also have the noise detail. And then we have the dots bump strength and the noise bump strength. So I'm just going to press Alt H to bring back all the objects here, just zoom in here to all the objects. And there we go, so there is the four procedural rubber materials.
