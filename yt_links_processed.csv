https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leuKvqbYyiY,Procedural Stylized Wireframe Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural, stylized wireframe material in Blender, which can be applied to models like cars for a techy effect or other sci-fi renders. The tutorial covers two versions of the wireframe material: one that emits light and another with customizable colors. Key features include adjustable wireframe thickness, brightness, noise effects, and customizable node groups. The tutorial also promotes the creator's Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, offering pre-set materials for Blender's asset browser.","In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural, stylized wireframe material in Blender. So this material could be really useful, for example, adding it onto a car model to kind of add a cool techy effect to the spinning car. You could also add it to other abstract or sci-fi renders. Now this wireframe shader doesn't actually show the correct topology of the mesh. You can see here's the actual topology of the mesh. Now the monkey does have a subdivision surface modifier, but you can see the wireframe shader is going to add these triangles here in the faces. So if you want to learn how to render proper wireframe images, then you can check out this other video which I made, and I'll have the link to that in the description. But this is more of a stylized, kind of futuristic wireframe effect that you can add to objects. Now we're going to be creating two different versions. So the first version is a wireframe emission, so the wireframe is actually going to emit light. And the other one here is just this base wireframe, which you can change the custom colors. So we have this base color here, and we also have the roughness of the material. And then we also have this cool wireframe thickness, so you can make it thicker or thinner depending on what you're working on. And then we also have the wireframe brightness for the emission, because it's emitting light. And then we also have the wireframe color, which is that emission color. Then we also have this cool noise value here. So if I turn up this noise amount, you can see there's going to be bits of noise where the wireframe disappears. And then we have the noise scale. We also have the detail level of the noise. And then we also have the roughness value of the noise. And then also noise distortion. So for this one, again, we have the base color. We also have the wireframe color. Then we also have the roughness of the material. And then again, we have the wireframe thickness. And then again, we have similar noise values. So we have the noise amount. And then we have the scale. We also have the detail. We also have the roughness. And then also the distortion. And if you'd like to purchase these procedural materials, you can get them with the links in the description. And you can also purchase all of my procedural materials by checking out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my procedural materials pre-set up for Blender's asset browser, with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. Now, every time I create another 10 procedural materials, I update the Ultimate Material Pack with all of my new materials. And so I've just finished these next materials. So these materials have just been added to my Ultimate Procedural Material Pack. And to learn how to create more materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I just went to the Add menu, and I just added a monkey head. And I scaled it down by a 0.2. And then hit Ctrl-A and just applied the scale. Then I hit Ctrl-1 to add a subdivision surface with one level. And I'll make the viewport and render levels both 1. And then I'll just shade it smooth. Then I'll move this over here and duplicate it so we have two different monkeys to preview both materials. Let's set up the lighting. So if I go here to the World Properties, I'm going to be adding in this Machineshop02 HDRI from polyhaven.com. So if you want to download it, the link is in the description. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on this yellow dot here next to Color. And you can choose Environment Texture. And then just click on the Open button and open up the HDRI. And I went up here to the Render Properties, and I opened up the Film tab. And I just checkmarked the Transparent button so you can't see the HDRI in the background. And then also here on the Color Management, I'm using AGX and Very High Contrast to make the colors more contrasted. So let's click over here to go to the Shading workspace. And I'll just select the first monkey head. I'll go into the Rendered Viewport mode. And then I'll click on New here to add a new material in the Shader Editor. And I'll just call this Wireframe Emission. We're going to be creating the Emission wireframe first. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So you can click here on Edit, and you can go to the Preferences. And then you go to the Add-ons tab, and just search for Node, and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on. So I'm going to start by making this a dark blue color. And if you want to use the same exact hex value, you can punch in this hex value right here. I'm just going to make it a nice dark blue color. Then I'm going to turn the Roughness down, so I'll just turn the Roughness down to like a 0.2, so it's kind of shiny. Now the main node that we're going to use to create this effect is the Wireframe node. So if you go to the Add menu, you can add the Wireframe node. And if I Ctrl-Shift and select the Wireframe, I can preview it. What I'm going to do is open up the Emission here, and I'm going to put the Factor into the Strength. And then I'll Ctrl-Shift-Select the Principled Shader to preview it. So now wherever the Wireframe is, that is going to make it an Emission. And then I can also drag this Size here down, so I can make it smaller. But you can see it's really hard to drag this value, because the value is so sensitive. So to make the Size less sensitive, so it's easier to change the Size, I'm going to search for a Math node. And we'll put the Math node here behind the Wireframe. And the value is going to go into the Size, so we're replacing that value. Now here on the Type here, I'm going to change it to Divide. So now on the top value, I'll turn it to 1. And on the bottom value, I'm going to turn it to 1000. So this way, we can now use the top value, and I can drag it back and forth. And you can see we can very easily have more customizable control over the size of it. Now the Wireframe shader is going into the Strength of the Emission. And so we don't actually have any value to change the brightness. So what I'm going to do is click on the Divide, and I'll duplicate it and stick it here. And then instead of Divide, I'm going to change it to Multiply instead. And then on this value here, I'll just turn it to a 1 on default. But now I can turn this value, and that's going to multiply the color values. And so it's going to make it brighter and brighter. So we can use this in the Custom node group to make the emission brighter. And then of course, if you want to, right here on the color, on the Emission color, you can change the emission color right there. But I'll just leave it as a white color. So now I want to add that cool noise effect so that some parts can be taken away by noise. So I'm just going to search for a noise texture. And we're just going to drop it up here. And then with the noise texture selected, I'll hit Ctrl-T to add the texture coordinate mapping. And I can just delete the mapping. And then let's put the object into the vector. And the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. And let's Ctrl-Shift-Select the noise texture to preview it. And let's now change some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 20. And I'll turn the detail up to 10 so it's pretty detailed. And then I'll turn the roughness up to a 0.6. So I do want to make it more contrasted. So let's go to the Add menu. And I'm just going to search for a color ramp. And let's stick it here after the noise. And for now, I'll just kind of drag these together so it's more contrasty. But we'll be customizing this later. So now what I want to do is I want to mix the color ramp in here with the wireframe. And I want to make it so that where the noise is, the wireframe is going to disappear. So to do this, I'm going to search for a mix color to mix two colors together. So we're going to take the color ramp and put that into the factor. And then the multiply can go into color A. Now here in color B, we can just make this fully black. So now I can take this mix result and I can replace it here for the strength. So now this is going to be the new color. So let's just Ctrl-Shift-Select the principal shader. And now you can see that where the noise is, if I Ctrl-Shift-Select it, you can see like right here, this is really bright. So wherever the noise is going to be really bright, that's where it's going to be disappearing. So I'll just Ctrl-Shift-Select the principal shader just to see that again. Now I do want to customize this a little bit. So what I'm going to do is on the color ramp here, I'm going to drag this over a bit. And then also drag the white tab over a little bit. I like something like that a little bit better. But then also I want to be able to control the visibility of the noise. Because maybe I just don't want to use the noise in some cases. So what I can do is add a hue saturation value node. And we'll put it here after the color ramp. Now the hue saturation value has this value which I can turn up and down. So I'll just Ctrl-Shift-Select it to preview it. So if I turn the value down, it's going to be fully black. So now you can see that it's showing all the wireframe. But if I turn the value up and make it lighter, more and more of it is going to be white. And so more and more of it is going to be disappeared. So I'll turn the value all the way to zero on default. But in the custom node group, we can turn this up to kind of add that cool effect. So now let's join this together into a node group. So I'm going to click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output. And I'll hit Ctrl-G to join it together into a node group. Let's hit Tab to go out of the node group. I'll just drag it over here. Let's make it bigger. And I can copy the material name and add it here into the node group. Let's hit Tab to go into the node group. And I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel. And then if I go over here to the group tab, we have the group sockets. And so I can double click on this to rename it. And I'll just rename it to shader because I like that better. So now we can plug up all the custom values to this group input to control them outside of the node group. So the first value that I want to add is the base color. So we'll drag the group input right over here next to the principled shader. And we'll put the base color. And also let's put the roughness into the extra sockets. Then let's control the wireframe thickness. So I'm going to drag the group input right back here. And this value can control the thickness. So we'll put the value into the extra socket. We'll double click on this to rename it. And I'll just rename that to wireframe thickness. Then to control the wireframe brightness, we have the multiply. So we'll put this into the extra socket. And this one I'm going to rename to wireframe brightness. Then for the wireframe color, we can drag this over here next to the principled shader. And we'll put the color into the extra socket. And you can leave this to emission color. I'm going to call it wireframe color. Or you could call it wireframe emission color. Whatever makes sense for you. Then let's control the noise amount. So I'll drag the group input under the color ramp. And we have this value that we can control how much noise. So we'll put the value into the extra socket. And I'll just rename this to noise amount. Then I want to control the noise settings. So I'll drag the group input back here behind the noise. And I'll put the scale, the detail, the roughness, and the distortion all into the extra sockets. And then if I drag this down, I'm going to copy the word noise here. And then I can paste it here. So we have noise scale, paste it here, noise detail, noise roughness, and noise distortion. So I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. Let's just drag this maybe up here. And I'll hit tab to go out of the node group. And I can just review the material to make sure it's working. So we first have the base color. That's looking good. Then we have the roughness of the material. We also have the wireframe thickness. We have the wireframe brightness. And then also the wireframe color. And then we have the noise amount. So I'll turn this up so I can see the noise. And then I also have the noise scale, the detail, also the roughness, and the distortion. So I'll turn the noise amount back to zero. So that is it for the first material. So I'm now just going to duplicate this material and add it to the other monkey. And we'll be creating another one which is similar but isn't an emission. So just select the other monkey head. We'll click on the dropdown. And we're just going to add the same material. But I now want to duplicate the material so that when we change the settings, it won't affect the other material. So to do this, we need to do two things. First, I'm going to click right here to duplicate the shader or the entire material. So now it says wireframe emission 001. I'm just going to get rid of that so we have just the base wireframe. However, this wireframe node group is the same node group right in here. So if I change the values, it would affect the other material. So I need to click on this 2 icon, click on the 2, and that's going to duplicate it. So it's now separate. And I'm just going to call it wireframe. So let's hit the Tab key to go into the node group. And I'm just going to change some of the settings. So because this material isn't going to be emission, let's go over here to the emission. And I'm going to unplug the color and unplug the strength of the emission. Make sure the strength is turned to 0, and we can just close the emission. Now if I hit the N key to open up the side panel, let's drag this down and make it bigger. We don't want to use the wireframe color, so we'll click on this. This is the emission one. So click on that and then hit the minus to get rid of it. And then we also don't need this multiply because this multiply node here was used to make it brighter. So if I click on the multiply, I'll hit Ctrl-X to get rid of it. So Ctrl-X will get rid of the value but still keep this wire plugged up. So now you can see we have this extra value here, the wireframe brightness. So if I click on the wireframe brightness, we'll hit the minus to get rid of it. Now I also want to get rid of the base color because we're going to be creating 2 separate custom colors. So here in the base color, just click on the base color here and hit the minus to get rid of that as well. So if I just Ctrl-Shift-Select the mix here, you can see this mix color has white and black. For the wireframe in the background. So let's click on the principles shader and we're just going to drag it back here. And then I'll just Ctrl-Shift-Select the principles shader so the viewer isn't in the way. So this mix here, I can put the mix result into the color. So now you can see we have black and white. But I want to create custom colors for this. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm just going to search for another mix color. And we're going to put this here after the first one. Now because this mix result is black and white, we can put it into the factor. And that's going to determine what part is going to be color A and what part is going to be color B. So then I'm going to make 2 different custom colors and I kind of like using these brownish grayish colors. So for color A, I'm going to be using this mid gray color. And you can punch in the hex value if you want to use the same color. And also on color B, this is going to be kind of like a dark brown. And again, you can punch in the same hex value if you want to get the exact same color I'm using. So now just make sure the mix result is going into the base color. Let's just kind of compress these together so it looks a little bit better. So I now want to add those new colors as custom colors. So I'll click on the group input and let's just drag it right up here. We'll zoom in here and I can now take color A, put that into the extra socket. And color B, put that into the extra socket. And let's double click on A and this is going to be the base color because this is the light one. And then here in color B, I'll double click on this to rename it and call it wireframe color. So now I'm going to click on the base color and I'm going to drag it up to the top and let go. So base color is at the top. And then click and drag and drop the wireframe right after that. So you have the base color and wireframe there at the very top. Now let's click on the group input and just drag it back to the very end and let's zoom into the color ramp. And for this material, I actually like the color ramp being more contrasty. I think it just looks better for the noise. So I'm going to drag these values really close to each other, kind of like that, kind of in the middle. So it's going to be more contrasted. So let's hit the tab key to go outside the node group. We'll hit N to close the side panel. And then we still have that viewer node plugged up. So just Ctrl-Shift-Select the principled shader to preview the final thing. So we have the base color of the material. Then we also have the wireframe color. And then we also have the roughness of the material. We also have the wireframe thickness. And then we have the noise amount, so I'll turn up the noise. And then we also have the noise scale, the noise detail, the noise roughness, and the noise distortion. So that's how you create these two procedural stylized wireframe materials. You can also purchase these procedural materials on my Gumroad store and Patreon page. And that's a great way to help support the channel. Now I've just finished creating all of these new materials. So these materials have just been added into my Ultimate Procedural Material Pack. So if you're an existing customer, you can redownload the product files and reinstall it as an asset library to get the updates with these new materials. You can also just purchase this new procedural material pack. So if you're interested in that, link is in the description. And you can also check out my procedural material tutorial playlist to learn how to create many more materials. So I hope you found this helpful, and thank you for watching."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3lyfrWlx3E,Procedural Rubber Materials - Part 2 (Blender Tutorial),"In part two of this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make two additional procedural rubber materials in Blender: grippy rubber and dotted rubber. The tutorial covers setting up textures, adjusting settings like scale and detail, and organizing nodes into customizable groups. The video also highlights options for purchasing these materials and the Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which includes pre-set materials for easy use in Blender. Viewers are encouraged to watch part one for foundational setup and lighting tips. The tutorial emphasizes flexibility in texture manipulation and customization through Blender's node system.","Welcome to part two of this two-part tutorial on how to create procedural rubber materials in Blender. So if you haven't seen the first part, definitely check that out with the link in the description. In the first part, we created these two materials. We created the bumpy rubber material and the smooth rubber material. And in this video, we're going to be creating the grippy rubber material and also this dotted rubber material. And if you'd like to purchase these materials to use in your projects, you can get that with the links in the description on my Gumroad store and Patreon page and the Blender Market. And if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials, you can check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my materials pre-set up for Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. So once you've set up my Ultimate Material Pack as an asset library in the Blender, you can just drag and drop the procedural materials into your 3D project. And you can also purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And you can also check out my procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube to learn how to create any of my materials. Now, as far as the 3D setup goes for this 3D scene, if you want to set up the same way that I have, then check out part one. If you haven't watched part one yet, then check that out. And I go over kind of the lighting setup and how I've set up the 3D scene. So let's now make the grippy rubber material. So I'm just going to select this object and I'll duplicate it and I'll just move it right down here. And then if I just select these other objects, I'll hit the H key to hide them just so they're out of the way so the viewport is a bit faster when we're rendering. And then if I select this object here, let's click on the X to get rid of that material. We'll add a new material. And this one will rename to grippy rubber. So let's start by creating the main texture, which is going to go into the base color. So I'll go to the Add menu. We're going to search for a noise texture. We'll drop this here. And with the noise texture selected, I'll hit Control T to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And I'll use the object coordinates and I'll just place the texture coordinate mapping down here and put the noise texture up here. So now I want to Control Shift select the noise texture so I can preview it. And let's change some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 120 and then I'll turn the detail up to a 6. So I want to put the factor into the base color. But before I do that, I want to create some custom colors. So I'll go to the Add menu and I'll search for a mix color. I'll put this after the noise and the factor can go into the factor of the mix. This way we have color A and color B. And so if I change this, that's going to be the custom colors to add some variation to the rubber material. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, you can use the same hex codes. So for color A, this is going to be a gray color and it's going to be six threes. So three, three, three, three, three, three, FF. And the FF, that's just for the alpha, because you can see if I drag this, that's during the alpha. So we want the alpha to be all the way up to one. Then here for color B, this is going to be a very dark gray. And for this one, the hex code is going to be one, nine, one, nine, one, nine, FF. So now I can take this mixed result and I can put that into the base color and let's control shift, select the principled shader to preview it. And then just for now, I'll turn the roughness of it. So it's a bit more rough, but we're going to be adding a value into the roughness later. So now let's create the main texture for the grippy part of the rubber. So I'll go to the Add menu and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture and let's use the same object coordinate. So I'll put the mapping vector into the vector of the Voronoi and I'll control shift select the Voronoi to preview it. And then let's change the settings. So on the F1 here, I'm going to change this to distance to edge. And now if I turn up the scale, you can see we have this cool crack texture. So I'm going to turn the scale to 800. So it's really detailed. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now I want to distort the Voronoi texture with another texture. So I'm going to search for a noise texture and we're going to drop it right here between the mapping and the Voronoi. So you can see it's distorting the Voronoi because it's going through the vector. And let's change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to a 25 and I'll turn the detail up to 6 and leave the other settings how they are. Now if I zoom in here, you can see it's like way too distorted. So I want the noise texture to have less of an effect over the Voronoi. So to do this, we're going to search for a mix color and we're going to drop it here between the noise texture and the Voronoi. And I can unplug this and I'm going to put the factor into color B and then I'm going to take this mapping vector and I'm going to put that into color A. So now this mix is mixing between A, which isn't distorted, and B, which is very distorted. And you can see as I drag this around, the texture is moving around a lot. So we'll click on the mix type here and we'll change it to linear light. And that way, when I drag this around, you can see it's distorting it, but it's not moving around quite so much. And then I'll turn the factor to a 0.02, just a 0.02. So now you can see it looks kind of random and noisy. So that just makes it look a bit more natural. So now this Voronoi texture is going to go into the normal. Let's control shift, select the principle shader. And I first want to add a color ramp to change the colors and make it more contrasted. So I'm going to search for a color ramp. We'll put this here and let's just control shift, select the color ramp to preview it. And the Voronoi distance can go into the factor of the color ramp. So I'm going to drag the white tab way over here and then leave the black tab here. So now you can see it's mostly white. And so basically by dragging this white over, it's making those little black lines a lot more thin. So now I can put the color into the normal and I'll control shift, select the principle shader to preview it. But you can see there's some weird shading issues. It's really dark over here. That's because we need to convert the color data into normal data. So we're going to search for a bump node. We're going to drop this here and the color can go into the height value. And now it's converted to bump data. And I'm going to turn the strength to a really small number of a 0.25, just a 0.25. So if I zoom in here, you can see it just looks a little bit bumpy. So let's click and drag the box like these nodes and I'm going to drag them down and box like these nodes and drag them up because I want to add a roughness value. So what we're going to do is drag this noise texture up here and we're actually going to put the noise texture into the roughness. But what I first want to do is change the colors. So we're going to search for a color ramp, drop this up here and I'll put the factor into the roughness. But then let's take the color ramp and put it in between the noise and the roughness. So now I can take the white tabs and black tabs and turn them up and down to control the roughness values. So on this one here, I'm going to leave it as fully white. Then the black one here, I'm going to turn this up and you can see if I turn it up, it's going to be more rough. And if you want to use the same exact hex code I'm using, this color here is going to be a color of 949494FF there on the hex code. And then also I want to be able to control the roughness values later in the custom node group. So if we just search for a hue saturation value, we can put this in between the color ramp and the principal shader. And we now have this value which I can drag up and down. So that's going to make the values lighter and darker. So that's going to control the roughness values. So that's it for the procedural material. So let's now join it together into a node group. So I'll click and drag the box, select all the nodes, accept the material output, and I'll press Ctrl G to join it together into a node group. And then I'll hit the tab key to outside the node group and I'll drag the node group over here. And let's make it bigger. And I can copy the material name and I can paste it here into the node group. Now also you can see this says BSDF and I want to rename that to shader. So if I go into the node group, I can press the N key to open up the side panel. And if I go here to the group tab and the group sockets, I can double click on this and just rename that to shader. So now on the group input, we can plug up all the custom values. So the mapping is plugged up to all the textures. So this scale will change the size of the entire material. So I'll put the scale and the extra socket. Let's click on the scale and you can see it's three values. But to make it one value, we can click on the type here and change it to float. Now I can turn the default value to one, but the texture is still gone. That's because I need to go tab out of the node group and then I need to turn the scale back to one. So now that's controlling the size of the entire material. So we'll hit tab to go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the colors. So I'll drag the group input right up here and we can take color A and color B and put them into the extra sockets. And then I'll just rename these to color one and two. Then I want to control the roughness. So if I take the heat saturation value, take the value here and put that into the extra socket, I can rename this to roughness. Then I want to control the texture scale. So we'll drag the group input right down here. Now let's take the voronoi and we'll put the scale into the extra socket and I can rename this to texture scale. Then I want to control the texture distortion, which is controlled by this linear light, because if I turn this up and down, it's distorting the texture. So we'll put this into the extra socket and I'll rename that to texture distortion. Let's also add the detail of the voronoi. So put the detail into the extra socket. I'll drag this down here and let's rename it to texture detail. Then I want to control the noise scale and the noise detail. So I'll drag the group input right up here and we have this scale and this detail. So we'll put both of these into the extra sockets. And then I'm just going to call this noise scale and noise detail. And then finally, I want to control the bump strength. So we'll drag the group input right down here. Let's take the strength, put that into the extra socket and I'll rename this to bump strength. So I'll drag the group input right up here and I'll hit the end key to close the side panel and I'll hit the tab key to go outside the node group. So here's the final material. So let's open this up, make it bigger and I can just review the final material. So we have the overall scale of the texture. Then we also have the two different colors. So color one and also color two. And then we also have the roughness to make it more shiny or rough. Then we also have just the texture scale, the texture distortion. We also have the detail. So if I zoom in really close, you can see if I turn up the detail, that's what it's going to look like. And then we also have the noise scale, which is controlling the noise of the color. Then we have the noise detail and then finally the bump strength. So now let's create the last material, which is the dotted rubber. So I'm going to click on the grippy rubber here or click on the object and I'll duplicate it and move it over here. We'll select this object and hit H to hide it. And we'll click on this object here. Let's kind of zoom into it like that. And I'll click on the X here to get rid of this material. Let's add a new material and I can call this dotted rubber. So we're first going to start by making the base color this dark gray color. And if you want to use the same hex value, you can punch in 262626FF. So it's just kind of like a dark gray. And then here on the roughness, I'm going to turn this to a 0.6 so it's a bit more rough. So let's now create the texture for the dots. So I'll go to the add menu and we're going to search for a Voronoi texture. Drop this here and I'll control shift select the Voronoi to preview it. And then also with the Voronoi texture selected, I'll press control T to add the texture coordinate mapping. Now I could use the object coordinates, but if I put the object into the vector, then what I want to do to make it look like dots is I'm going to take the F1 and change it to smooth F1. Now you can see the edges are smooth and then I can turn up the scale. So I'll just turn this down like that. Now if I take the random value here at the bottom and I turn this down to zero, you can see there's a problem here. And that's because this procedural texture has 3D texture space. So you're seeing little slices of these circles in different areas. And that's because this object is three dimensional. And so I wouldn't want to actually use the object coordinates in this case, I'd want to use the UV coordinates instead. So I'm going to put the UV into the vector. So if you're going to use the UV coordinates, you'll just need to make sure you properly UV unwrap your object. So because we're UV unwrapping it, the texture is now laying flat on the faces of the object. So now here on the Voronoi settings, we already changed the smooth F1 and then we already turned the random to zero. But let's turn the scale up to a 200. So the dots are much smaller. So now I want to make the dots more contrasted. So let's search for a color ramp, we'll put this here after the Voronoi. And then I can drag the black tab kind of to about here. And then I'll drag the white tab over to the other side. And I'll just bring it to about there. So now you can see there's these little white circles with black behind it. So we're going to be putting this into the normal to give it some bump. So we'll drag these nodes back here. Let's search for a bump node, we'll drop it down here. So we can first take the color ramp color and put that into the normal. And then if I Ctrl Shift, select the principal shader, you can see there's some weird shading issues. So I need to put the bump here in between the color ramp and the principal. And then the color needs to be going into the height value to convert it to bump data. So now you can see we have some little bumps there on the rubber. And I'm going to turn the bump strength down to like a point four. So it's not quite as bumpy. Now I also want to be able to control the size of the bumps. So let's drag the Voronoi and color ramp back here. And in between these two nodes, I'm going to search for a hue saturation value. And we'll put this right here. So it's after the Voronoi. So the value here, we can drag this up and down. And that is going to make it lighter and darker. So that is going to change the size of each individual little dot there. So then I also want to add a noise texture, which is also going to be going into the bump just to make the surface more bumpy. So let's just search for a noise texture, drop this up here. And I can use the same vector, put that into the vector, the noise, and then I'll Ctrl Shift, select the noise to preview it. And let's change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to 40. And I'll turn the detail to 10. And I'll turn the roughness to a point six. So I now want to go over here to the principal shader and drag this back. And I'm going to take the bump node and I'll duplicate it and drop it here. And we can put the noise texture factor into the height value of this bump. And then let's Ctrl Shift select the principal shader to preview it. So now you can see we're mixing it together because we have two bump nodes. Now that is way too bumpy. So I want to make this much less strong. So I'm going to turn the bump strength just to a point zero six point zero six. So now if I zoom in here, you can see there's just a little bit of bumpiness there on the rubber. And that is it for the procedural material. So let's join together into a new. Now I don't want to put the texture coordinate into the node group because when I add this in my ultimate procedural material pack, I want my customers to know that it's using the UV coordinates. So they'll have to UV unwrap the object if they want to add it onto some object. Or they could also use the object coordinates if they're just using like a flat object. But what I'm going to do is box select all these nodes except the material output and the texture coordinate. I'll hit Ctrl G to join together into a node group. And I'll hit the Tab key to go outside the node group. And we can just drag these nodes together to compress them. Let's also drag this out to make it bigger. And then I can copy the material name and paste it here into the node group. Let's hit the Tab key to go into the node group. And I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel. And here on the group sockets here, I just want to double click on this and rename it to shader because I like that better. So now let's plug up all the custom values. So we'll plug the scale here from the mapping into the extra socket. If we click on the scale, let's click on the type here and change it to float. So it is one value. And then we can turn the default value to one. Let's go out of the node group and turn the scale back to one. And then we can go back into the node group. Now let's also control the base color and the roughness. So I'm going to drag the input over here. And we'll put the base color and the roughness into the extra sockets. Now I also want to control the size of the dots. So we'll drag this back here. And we can take this value from the hue saturation value. I'll put that into the extra socket. And this one I'm going to rename to dot size. Then let's control the dot scale. So we'll put the Voronoi texture scale into the extra socket. And we'll rename this to dot scale. And actually, what I'm going to do is click and drag and drop the dots size after this one. So this one is below it. And then this one I'll rename to dots individual size because that makes more sense. Then I want to control the noise settings. So we'll put the scale and the detail into the extra socket. And I'll call this noise scale and noise detail. And then I want to control the bump strengths. So we'll drag the input right down here. And if we zoom in here, this first one is the dots bump strength. So we'll put this one in the extra socket. Let's rename this one here to dots bump strength. And then the last one here, we'll put the strength into the extra socket. This one, as you can see, is the noise. So I'll put this into the extra socket. And this one I'll rename to noise bump strength. I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. Let's drag the group input right back here. And I can hit tab to go outside the node group. Let's just zoom out here and review the final material. So we have the scale to change the size of the entire material. You can also use the object coordinates if you want to. And let me just show you real quick. If I just add a plane, maybe scale the plane down and apply the scale. If I now add this same material to a flat object here like a plane, you can see using the object coordinates, it actually looks just fine. So if you're adding this to a flat object, you can use the object coordinates. But for an object like this, which is round, I'm going to be using the UV coordinates instead. So we have the scale, then we also have the base color. So I'm just keeping it gray, that makes sense for rubber. Then we have the roughness, we have the dot scale, that's all the dots at once. And then we have the dots individual size. Then we have the noise scale, we also have the noise detail. And then we have the dots bump strength and the noise bump strength. So I'm just going to press Alt H to bring back all the objects here, just zoom in here to all the objects. And there we go, so there is the four procedural rubber materials. So that will be it for this video. So I hope you enjoyed this, I hope you found it helpful, and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF-jGF_VmJ4,Procedural Rubber Materials - Part 1 (Blender Tutorial),"This Blender tutorial demonstrates how to create four procedural rubber materials, divided into two parts. In part one, the tutorial covers the creation of bumpy and smooth rubber materials, utilizing techniques like Voronoi and noise textures to achieve desired effects. The materials are assembled into custom node groups for easy customization, which are also available for purchase. The tutorial also provides guidance on setting up the 3D viewport and lighting for rendering. In part two, the tutorial will focus on creating grippy and dotted rubber materials. The creator offers resources for further learning and purchasing materials through various platforms.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create these four procedural rubber materials. And if you'd like to purchase these procedural materials, you can get them with the links in the description on my Gumroad store and Patreon page and also the Blender Market. Now because I'm creating four different procedural materials, I'll be breaking up this tutorial into two parts. So in this part, in part one, we're going to be creating this bumpy rubber and also the smooth rubber. And then in part two, we're going to be creating the grippy rubber and also the dotted rubber. So these four materials are also going to be joined together into custom node groups. So I'll show you how to join them together into these node groups so that you can easily control the look of the material. And if you purchase the procedural material, then they'll already come joined into these node groups so you can easily customize them for your project. You can also check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my procedural materials pre-set up for Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. And you can purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create more materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the Add menu, I went to Mesh, and I just added an Icosphere. And then right behind me on the Add Icosphere settings, I turned the subdivisions up to six so it is nice and smooth and round, and I shaded the object smooth. Then I scaled it down by a 0.2, and I pressed Ctrl-A and just applied the scale. That's the default size of the object. Then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And because I'm making four of them, I just stuck it up here in the corner. And if you select the camera and click right here to go to the object data properties of the camera, I turned the focal length up to 80 just to kind of zoom it in and make everything look a bit more flat. Now for the lighting, I added a few different area lights. So I added this area light right here kind of shining down on the top. The power is set to 250, and I set it to disk. Then I also added this area light right here and this area light right here. So these ones are set, the shape is set to rectangle. They're going to add some nice room lights on the back, and I set the power to 80 for both of these. And then I also wanted to add some nice realistic lighting and reflections. So here on the world properties, I added in this HDRI from polyhaven.com. I'll have a link in the description if you want to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to color, you can choose environment texture, and then just click on the open button and open up the HDRI. Also here on the render properties, you can scroll down here and open up the film tab, and then you can just check mark the transparent button so you can't see the HDRI in the background. And then also if I go down here to the color management, I'm using AGX and very high contrast to make everything look more saturated. So I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mode, and I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll just click on new to add a new material. And this one I'll just call bumpy rubber. And then also I'll be using the Node Wrangler add-on in the video. So you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences. And then over here on the add-ons tab, just search for node and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start making the bumpy rubber, we want to create a texture with some little dots. So to do this, I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. We'll drop here and I'll hold down the control and shift key and select the Voronoi texture. And then I can turn up the scale and I'm going to turn the scale up to a really big number of 800. And now if I zoom in here, you can see there's a bunch of little dots. Now with the Voronoi texture selected, I'll press control T, that's using the feature of the Node Wrangler, and it's going to add the texture coordinate mapping. And I'm going to put the object into the vector because the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the object more evenly. Now I also want to distort this texture with a noise texture. So in between the mapping and the Voronoi, I'm going to search for a noise texture and put it in between these two nodes. Now you can see it's distorting a lot and we're going to change that later. But first, let's change the noise settings. So I'm going to turn the scale up to 30 and I'll turn the detail up to 10 so it is more detailed. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. So now if I zoom in really close, you can see it's really distorted, but I want it to be less distorted. So let's go to the add menu. We're going to search for a mix color and we'll put this between the noise and the Voronoi. Now what we're going to do is unplug the noise and we're going to take the factor and we're going to put that into color B. And then we're going to take the mapping vector and put that into color A. Now this factor is going to blend between distorting it less or distorting it more. You can see the texture isn't moving around a lot. So let's click on the mix type here and we're going to change it to linear light. And that way, as I drag the factor, it's still distorting it, but it's not moving it around so much. So then I'm going to turn this to a really small number of 0.01. And that way, if I zoom in here, you can still see it mostly just looks like that Voronoi dots texture, but it looks kind of noisy. Now, if I control shift, select the principal shader, let's do a few things to the principal shader. So I'm going to leave the roughness at 0.5, but you can change this if you want to. And then we're going to make the base color really dark. And the hex value that I'm using for this base color here, this is going to be a really dark brown color. And the hex value is going to be 0D0702FF. So now I want this Voronoi texture to be going into the normal to make it look kind of bumpy. So we're going to take the Voronoi distance and let's put that into the normal. But then we need to convert this to proper normal data. So I'm going to search for a bump node. I'll put the bump node between the Voronoi and the principal shader. And the distance is going to go into the height value of the bump. So now if I zoom in here close to the material, you can see it looks really bumpy. Now I want to control the contrast of the bumps. So we're going to search for a color ramp. And we're going to put the color ramp between the Voronoi and the bump. And now we can drag the black tab and drag the white tab. And you can see now the dots are going to be smaller. And I'm actually going to flip both of these. So I'm going to put the white tab kind of to about here, and then I'll put the black tab over to about here. So now if I zoom in closely, you can see there's just a bunch of little dots. And then later on when we create the custom node group, I want to be able to change the size of the dots. So I can just search for a hue saturation value, and we'll put this after the Voronoi. Now the value here, I can drag this up and down, and that's going to make the texture lighter and darker. So that's controlling the size of each individual dot. So now if I zoom out, you can see it's way too strong. So let's take the bump strength, and I'll turn that to a small number of like a 0.2. So now you can see it just looks like this subtle bumpy rubber. Now I also want to add a noise texture just to give it a little bit of noise over the surface. So we'll search for a noise texture, and I can just drop the noise texture right up here above the linear light. And we can take the mapping vector and put that into the vector so it's using the object coordinates. Let's control shift select the noise texture preview it, and I'll change the settings. So I'll turn the scale up to 40 so it's larger, and I'll turn the detail to 10. And then I'll turn this roughness up a little bit to a 0.6. So now it's kind of detailed. So I now want to put this noise texture into the bump as well. So we'll drag these nodes back, and we're going to take the bump node and we'll duplicate it and drop it here after the first one. So the normal is going to the normal, but we now have an extra height value that we can add data into. So let's take the noise texture factor, and I can put that into the height value, and then we'll control shift select the principled shader. So now it looks way too bumpy because it's super noisy, so I'm going to turn the bump strength down quite a bit. So I'm going to turn the bump strength to a 0.05. So now it's very subtle, but you can turn that up more if you want to, but I want to keep it pretty subtle. So that's it for the procedural material. So to join it together into a custom node group, we can click and drag and box select all the nodes, but I don't want to select the material output. So drag and select all the nodes except the material output, and I'll press ctrl g to join it together into a node group. I'll hit the tab key to go outside the node group, and I'm going to drag the node group here next to the material output, and let's make it bigger. And I can copy the material name and paste it here in the node group, so it's called bumpy rubber. And I'll hit the tab key to go into the node group, and I'll hit the n key to open up the side panel. And right here on the group tab, we have the group sockets, and I'm going to double click on the bsdf, and I'll rename it to shader because I like that better. So you can see now it's called the shader. So we'll go back into the node group. Now over here on this side, we have this group input, and we can plug values up to the group input to control them outside the node. Now this mapping is plugged up to all the textures, so the scale value is going to control the size of the entire material. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket, and then if I click on the scale, I don't want it to be three values. I just want it to be one value instead. So we're going to take the type here, and we're going to change it to float. And then here on the default value, we'll turn this to one. And then if we go outside the node group, we want to turn this scale value back to one. So that will change the size of the entire material. So let's go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the size of each individual dot. So if I drag through input right up here, we have this value, and that's going to change the size of each individual dot because it's changing the brightness and darkness of the texture. So we're going to put the value into the extra socket. Let's double click on this to rename it, and we'll rename this to dots individual size. Then let's also drag this over here next to the principal shader, and I want to put the base color and the roughness both into the extra sockets. Then I want to control the dot's scale and the dot's detail, so we'll drag the group input right down here next to this Voronoi, and we can put the scale into the extra socket and also the detail. And then click and drag down here to make this bigger, and let's rename this. So I'm going to rename this to dot's scale and then also dot's detail. Now I also want to control the noise scale and the noise detail, so I'll drag the group input right up here. I'll put the noise scale into the extra socket and also the detail. Let's drag this down to make it bigger, and I'll just rename this to noise scale and then also noise detail. Then I want to control the distortion, so we'll take this linear light here, and this linear light has a factor, and that's kind of distorting the texture. So we'll put the factor into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to distortion. And then finally, I want to control the bump strength, so we'll drag this right down here next to the bump, and the first one that we have is the dot's bump strength, so we'll put that into the extra socket. And then the second one here, that is the noise bump strength, so we'll put the strength into the extra socket. And then I'll rename this, so dot's bump strength, and then the second one here, this is going to be noise bump strength. I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. Let's drag the group input right back here, and I'll hit tab to go outside the node group. And now we can just review the final material to make sure everything's working correctly. So we have the overall size of the entire material, so you can change this depending on the size of your object. Then if I zoom in here, we have the dot's individual size, so I can make them smaller or make them quite big until they overlap. Then we also have the base color, but since this is rubber, I'm leaving it at a really dark color. We also have the roughness of the rubber, and then we just have the dot's scale, and then we just have the dot's detail. Then we have the noise scale and the noise detail. Then we also have this distortion value, if you want to make it more distorted, or if you turn the distortion down to zero, the dots are less distorted and they're a lot more round and consistent. And then there's also the dot's bump strength, and then also the noise bump strength. So that is it for the first material, so we'll now create the second material in this video. So now let's create the next rubber material, which is the smooth rubber. So I'm just going to duplicate this object, and I'll just bring it over here, bring it along the x-axis, and then I'm going to delete the material, and we're going to add a new material, and we're going to call this one smooth rubber. Let's go into the rendered viewport mode, and then just to make the viewport a little bit faster, I'm just going to select the other object and hit h to hide it, just so the view doesn't have to render it. I'm going to zoom into this object here, which has the smooth rubber. So let's start by going to the add menu, we're going to add a noise texture, and let's preview the noise texture. And then also with the noise texture selected, I'll hit ctrl t to add the texture coordinate mapping, and I want to use the object, so we'll put the object into the vector. And then also I like to keep my nodes nicely organized, so I'm going to box select these two nodes, I'll hit ctrl j to join them into a frame, so now I can move the frame around, and then I'll select the frame and hit f2 to add a label, and I'm just going to call this mapping. So now let's change that noise texture setting. So I'm going to turn the scale to a 6, I'll turn the detail up to 10, so it's pretty detailed, and I'll turn the roughness up to like a 0.7. Now I want to distort this noise texture with another texture, so I'm going to duplicate the noise texture and drop it here, so it's going through the vector, so it's going to distort the noise texture. And then we'll change some of the settings of this noise, so for this one I'm going to turn the scale to 5, I'll keep the detail at 10, and I'll turn the roughness up to like a 0.8. Now I want to control how much of the noise texture is distorting the first noise, so I'm going to search for a mix color, I'll put this between the two noise textures, and I'm going to unplug the noise texture, and we're going to take the factor, and I'm going to put that into color B, and then I'm going to take the mapping vector, and I'm going to put that into color A. Now I have this factor which I can control to control the distortion, and I want to take the mix type here and change it to linear light, and that way it's not going to move the texture around as much, but it's still going to distort it. And I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.06, so it's just distorting it a little bit. So let's just compress these nodes, and I'll select them and join them into a frame, and then I will add a label, and I'll just call this rubber because this is the main rubber texture. And this texture is actually going to be going into the roughness value to make some parts more rough and other parts more shiny to add some variation. So let's now put this into the roughness so the noise texture factor can go into the roughness value, and I can control shift select the principal shader, and then here on the base color let's make it fully black so it's a black rubber. So if I zoom in here, kind of look at the reflections, you can see other parts are more rough and more shiny, but I want to control the roughness values, and I want the rubber to mostly be pretty rough. So let's go to the add menu, we're going to search for a color ramp, and we're going to put the color ramp between the noise and the principal, and we'll use the color ramp to change the roughness values. So if I click on the black tab and make it lighter, you can see everything's going to be more rough. So what I'm going to do is make it a light gray, and I'm going to put this tab kind of over here, and then I'll bring the white tab over to about here so it's a bit more contrasty. So you can see the variation. And for the light gray, this is going to be a hex value of c7 c7 c7 ff. And then this other one here, this is just going to be fully white, so make it fully white. So now we're going to be creating another texture up here, which is going to be some little tiny scratches over the rubber. So to do this, I'm going to search for a magic texture. We'll drop it here, and I'll control shift select the magic texture, preview it, and then let's use the same object coordinates. So the mapping is going to go into the vector of the magic. And we'll change the depth up to five, and then I'll turn the distortion here all the way up to five as well. And this is what we're going to use to make the scratches. And then I'll turn the scale down to like a two. So now I want to make it really contrasty. So just the lighter parts are going to show up. So there's just some scratches here and there. So I'm going to take this color ramp, and I'll duplicate it and drop it here. And then with the color ramp selected, I'll hit the backspace, and that's going to reset the color ramp. So I can now drag these two values together, and I'm actually going to flip them. So it's mostly black, which is little bits of white. So just drag that over there, and that over there. So now you can see where the scratches are just showing up in a few areas here and there, but it's mostly going to be black. So now I want the magic texture to be distorted similarly like we did with this noise texture, so that the scratches look more noisy and random. So I'm going to select the noise texture and the linear light, and I'm going to press control shift d. So control shift d will duplicate the nodes, but keep the wires plugged up. And then I'll press alt p, and alt p is going to bring it out of the frame. So let's now take the linear light result, and we're going to put that into the vector of the magic texture. And then I can select all these nodes, join them into a frame, and I can add a label, and I can call this scratches. Now I want to change a few settings on the noise texture in the linear light. So for one thing, I want to make it a bit more distorted, so I'll turn this factor here to a 0.1 on the linear light, but then I want to change the noise settings, because if I zoom in here, it just looks way too noisy. So I'm going to turn the scale to a 6, and I'll leave the detail at 10. Then the roughness here, I'm just going to turn it to like a 0.55, and I can see the scratches just look a little bit noisy and random, but they don't look too rough. So now we have the scratches, and we have the rubber texture, and so I want to put the scratches here into this color, and I want to make it so that the scratches are also adding to the roughness. So we'll drag these nodes back here, and let's go to the add menu, and to mix them together, I'm going to add a mix color. Let's ctrl shift select the mix color to preview it, and I'm going to put the color amp color into color A, and then I'm going to put this color amp from the scratches, and this color is going to go into the factor. Now I just want to add the light values, so on the mix type here, we're going to change this to lighten. Then I can drag this value here, color B, I can turn this up more and more, and you can see as I turn it up, the scratches are going to show up more. And for color B here, I want it to be a really light color, but not fully light, and here on color B, this hex value is going to be EC, EC, ECFF. So now this lighten result can go here into the roughness, so we'll replace it for the color ramp, and I'll ctrl shift select the color ramp to preview it. So now you can see here if I zoom up to one of the scratches, this here, color B, this is going to make the scratches more rough or more shiny. Now I also want to be able to control the roughness values, so I'll go to the add menu, and we're going to add a hue saturation value, and I'll put this between the lighten and the principal shader, and I can now drag this value around, and that's going to control the brightness and darkness of the color, and so that is going to control the roughness of the material. And then finally, I want to add some values into the bump strength, so let's go to the add menu, and we'll search for a bump node and drop this here, so the normal can go into the normal, and now we can take this noise texture here from the rubber, and we're going to put that into the height value. So you can see now it's just making the rubber look a little bit noisy, but I'm going to turn it to a really small number here, so on the bump strength I'll turn this to a 0.04. So now it's very subtle, you can turn it up more if you want to, but I'm going to keep it more smooth. And then we're going to take this bump node, and we're going to duplicate it, and we're going to drop it here after the first one, so the normal can go through the normal, but we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So let's take the scratches color ramp here, and we're going to put this into the height value, so now you can see as I turn this up, it's going to make the scratches look kind of bumpy, but again I want to be very subtle, so I'll turn it to a 0.02. You can turn it up more if you want to, but I mainly just want the scratches to show up on the roughness, just to make it a little bit rough and not too dented. So that is the finished smooth rubber material, so I'll now join it together into a node group. So I'm going to click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output, and I'll hit ctrl g to join it together into a node group. I'll hit the tab key outside the node group, and I'll just drag the node group over here. Let's make it bigger, and then I can copy the material name and paste it here into the node group. Let's hit the tab key to go into the node group, and I'll hit the n key to open up the side panel, and if I go to the group tab here on the group sockets, I'm going to rename this to shader because I like that better. So now we can add up all the custom values to the group input. So we'll first put the mapping scale into the extra socket, and then if I click on the scale we want to be one value, so on the type here we're going to change it to float. Then we're going to go outside the node group, and we can turn the scale back to one. So let's go back into the node group. The next values that I want to add is the color and the roughness, so we'll drag the group input right over here. Let's take the base color, put that into the extra socket, and then also the hue saturation value. We can put the value into the extra socket, and this is going to control the roughness, so we'll double click on this to rename it and just rename it to roughness. Now I also want to control the rubber distortion, so if I just drag the group input right down here, we have this linear light, and this is controlling the distortion of the base texture. So we'll put the factor into the extra socket, and I'll just rename that to rubber distortion. Then I want to control the scratches, so I'll drag the group input right up here, and let's take the magic texture scale and put that into the extra socket. Then this noise texture has the detail, and the detail value is controlling the detail of the scratches. You can see if I zoom in here and just turn the detail down, they look a lot more smooth. So put the detail into the extra socket. Let's open this up, and we'll rename them. So this one is going to be scratches scale, and the other one here is going to be scratches detail. And then we also have this magic texture distortion value, so I'll put the distortion into the extra socket, and this one I'll name to scratches distortion. And then I want to control the bump strength, so I'll drag the group input right down here, and this first one is just the noise, so I'll put this into the extra socket, and let's just call this noise bump strength, or you can call it rubber bump strength. And then also this bump here, the second one, that is just the scratches, so I'll put this one into the extra socket, and this one I'm going to call scratches bump strength. Let's hit the N key to close the side panel, and I'll drag the group input right back here, and we'll hit tab to go outside the node group, and now we can just review the final material. So we have the scale value to change the size of the material, then we also have the base color, then we have the roughness of the material, the rubber distortion, we also have the scratches scale. It's a little bit hard to see, but if I kind of zoom in there, you can see it a little bit better. Then also the detail of the scratches, the distortion of the scratches, and then we have the noise bump strength, and also the scratches bump strength. So this is going to finish it up for part one on how to create procedural rubber materials. So we've created these two materials in this video, and in the next video we're going to be creating these two next rubber materials. So when that video is released, you can find it with the link in the description or right up there on the end screen. And if you'd like to purchase these procedural materials and help support the channel, you can get those with the links in the description. So thank you for watching, and I'll see you in part two."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gCcVIC_2SA,Procedural Chipped Paint Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural chipped paint material in Blender. It covers setting up a custom node group to control various aspects of the material, such as scale, metallic appearance, colors, distortion, chip size, detail, roughness, and bump strength. The tutorial includes a demonstration of applying the material to a 3D model, using an HDRI for lighting, and organizing nodes for efficiency. Additionally, the creator offers the procedural material for purchase and provides links to their Gumroad store and Patreon page for those interested in supporting the channel or accessing more resources.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural chipped paint material. So after we create the material, we'll be joining it together into this custom node group to control the look of the material. So we first have the scale value, which changes the entire size of the material. Then we also have the metallic value. So where the paint has been chipped away, there is metal underneath. But if you don't want it to be metallic, you could instead turn that down. But I'm going to keep the metallic value all the way to one. So it looks like the base of the object is metal, but then it has paint on the top, but then the paint has been chipped away. Then we also have the base color, so I kind of just have it as a red color. And then we also have the metal color. Then we also have the distortion of the chipped paint. So I can turn this up more, and it's kind of smaller and more distorted, or I can turn it down, and it's a bit more chunky. I just like leaving it to a small value. Then we have the chip scale, so I can make lots of small chipped paint pieces, or I can make it bigger. And then we also have the individual size. So this is going to change the individual size of each one of the chipped paint pieces. So if you turn it up too high, that doesn't really look good. So maybe just keeping it somewhere between a 0.5 to a 0.8, something like that, so you can control the size of the chips. And then we also have the detail of the chipped paint. Then we also have the roughness scale, so that's controlling the scale of the noise texture. And then we have a roughness value to change the roughness of the paint. And then finally, we have a bump strength, and the bump strength kind of makes the edges kind of pop in a little bit. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this procedural material, you can get it with the links in the description on my Gumroad store and Patreon page. And you can also purchase all of my procedural materials with my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my materials pre-set up for Blender's Asset Browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable load groups. And to learn how to create all of my materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport. So I wanted to preview this on a sphere, so I went to the Add menu and I added an Icosphere. And then right behind me on the Add Icosphere settings, just turn up the subdivisions to like a 6, so it is nice and smooth and round. I can use the object context meter to shade it smooth. And then I want to scale it down to like a 0.2. And then I will press Ctrl A and apply the scale. So that's the default size of the object. Then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera at the object. And if you select the camera and open up the object data properties here on the side panel, I turned the focal length up to 80 just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit. Now as for the lighting, I added a few different area lights. So I added this big area light here on the back to kind of give a rim light to the object. And then I also added these two area lights right here. And then also I went over here to the world properties and I added in this Machineshop 02 HDRI. I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So you can download this for free from polyhaven.com with the links in the description. And once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot next to color. You can click on environment texture and then click on the open button and open up the HDRI. And then also right up here on the render properties, I opened up the film tab and I turned on the transparent button so you can't see the HDRI in the background. And also here on the color management, I'm using AGX and very high contrast to make it more contrasted and saturated. So I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here and I'm in the rendered mode. So we'll just make this a bit smaller. And then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll select the object and just add a new material and I'll just rename this to chipped paint. And then I'll also be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So you can click here and edit. You can go to the preferences and here in the add-ons tab, just search for Node and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, I'm going to go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture and let's control shift and select the Voronoi texture preview. Now with the Voronoi texture selected, I will press control T. That's using the feature of the Node Wrangler. That's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I want to use the object coordinates. So I'll put the object into the vector because the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. So now I can change some of the Voronoi settings. So on the F1 here, I'm going to change it to F2 instead. And then here on this bottom setting, I'm going to change this to the Minkowski. And you can see it is a little bit hard to see, but if I turn the scale down, you can kind of see it a little bit better. There's kind of like all these little kind of sharp areas and there's kind of like some star shapes. So on the scale here, I'm going to turn the scale to a 50, but then I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now I want to keep my nodes nicely organized as I'm creating this. So I'm going to box select these nodes and I'll hit control J just to join them into a frame and I'll select the frame and press F2 to add a label. And I'm just going to call this mapping. So those are the mapping nodes. Now I want to be able to see the Voronoi texture better. So we're going to go to the add menu and we're going to search for a color ramp and drop this here. And I can drag the black tab and the white tab together. And I'm actually going to switch them. So I'm going to drag the black tab over here and then I'll drag the white tab pretty close. And you can see now we just have a texture of where the little chipped paint is going to be. So wherever it's white, that is where the little chipped bits of paint are going to show up. Now later in the custom node group, I want to be able to control the size of the chipped pieces. So if we go to the add menu and just search for a hue saturation value, we can put this after the Voronoi. And the hue saturation value has this value. And if I turn up the value or turn down the value, that is going to make the texture brighter and darker. So that's going to change the size of the chipped pieces. So let's box select these three nodes and I'll hit Ctrl J to add a frame. And I'll select the frame and press F2. And I'm going to call this chipped because that's creating the chipped texture. Now I also want to distort the little chipped pieces because if I zoom in here, you can see they're a little bit straight and I want to make them a bit more random. So in between the mapping and the chipped texture, I'm going to search for a noise texture and I'll put this between the mapping and the Voronoi. And so that is going to distort it. You can see those bits of chipped paint looks really distorted. And then I'll change some of the noise texture settings. So I'll turn the scale to six and I'll turn the detail to 10. But it's distorting it way too much and I don't want it to be distorting it that much. So we'll drag these nodes back. And then I'm going to search for a mix color. So just add the mix color node. And I'm going to put the color into color B. And then I'm going to take the vector and I'm going to put that into color A. So now this factor is going to blend between only using A or only using B. So the result can go into the vector. Now as I drag the factor, it's going to distort it more and less. And to make the texture not move around so much, let's click on the mix type here. And we're going to use linear light so it doesn't move around quite as much. So now if I zoom in really close to the chipped paint here, you can see as I drag this, it's controlling the distortion. And it's adding more detail to the edges. So I'm going to turn this to a 0.05, just a 0.05. But now if I kind of zoom into a little bit of chipped paint, you can see it has a lot more kind of random noise there on the edges. So let's drag these together. We'll box select them and add a frame. And I'll add a label. And I'll just call this distortion. So now let's go over here to the shaders and I want to create two principal shaders. One of them is going to be the paint and the other one's going to be the metal. So I'll duplicate this node by hitting shift D and just drop it up here. Let's first control shift select the top one. And I'm going to make the paint. So I'm going to be using this nice dark red. And if you want to use the same color I'm using, you can go to the hex value and you can punch in 721B1AFF. And then for now, we'll just turn the roughness down a little bit. But later, we're going to be adding some nodes into the roughness. But for now, I'll just turn it down to like a 0.2. Let's control shift select this principal shader. And for this one, I'm going to turn the metallic all the way up to one. We can also turn the roughness down a little bit. So now it looks like a shiny metal material. And then for the base color, I'll make it a gray color. And the hex value for this gray color is going to be A7, A7, A7FF. And so I want to now mix both of these shaders together. So if I select both of the shaders at once, I can press control zero. That's going to add this mix shader. So now if I drag the factor, it's going to blend between using the paint or using the metal. But to determine what part is paint and what part is metal, we can use the chipped color right here. So this is going to be the factor. So we're going to put that into the factor. Now, if I zoom in here, you can see most of its paint, but there's little bits of chipped areas where you can see the metal underneath. Now, I also want to put the chipped paint texture into the bump so that the edges look a bit bumpy. So I'm just going to search for a bump node. We'll drop the bump node right down here. And the color and color can go into the height value. So now I can put this bump normal into this one and also the bump normal into this one. So now if I just zoom in really close, let's zoom into one of the bigger pieces. You can see along the edge there, it looks kind of like it's bumping out. But let's click on the invert button. So now it's inverted, so it looks like it's going back in instead. And then here on the bump strength, I'll turn it down to like a 0.4 so it's not quite as strong. And I'll just box select these and kind of compress the nodes down just a little more nicely organized. Now, I do want to make the little bits of chipped paint a little bit bigger because they are quite small. So let's go here to the hue saturation value and let's change this. So on the value here, I'm going to turn this down to like a 0.7 and that way the bits of chipped paint are quite a bit larger so they're easier to see. But this can be used to change the size of the chipped paint. Now, I also want to create another node group which is going to add a little bit of variation to the roughness. So let's search for a noise texture, drop it here. I'll hold down the ctrl and shift key and select it to preview it. And let's use the same mapping. So I'll put the vector into the vector there and then we'll change some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to like a 40 and I'll turn the detail to 10. I'm also going to turn up the roughness to a 0.7 so it's a little bit more detailed. And then the lacunarity, I'll turn up to a 3. And the lacunarity almost makes it look like there's little clumps of dots kind of being clumped together. So I'm just turning it up a little bit. So the noise texture can now go into the roughness values. So I'll put the factor into this roughness and also the factor into this roughness. And let's ctrl shift select the principled shader. So now if I zoom in here to the reflections, you can see there's a bit of variation in the roughness, but that's too rough and I want to make it more shiny. So let's go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a color ramp. We'll put the color ramp after the noise. So just plug it into that one. And then the color here can go into the roughness. So now the color ramp is going both into the roughness values. So now I can drag the white tabs and black tabs around and you can see if it's more black, it'll be more shiny. Or if it's more white, it's going to be more raw. So I'm going to make two mid gray colors. So for this one on this side, the hex value is going to be B4, B4, B4, FF. And then the other one right here, this darker gray is going to be 7C, 7C, 7C, FF. And then just to add a bit more contrast, you can kind of see it better, I'm going to drag both of these together a little bit, something like that. So now you can see there's just a little bit of variation in the roughness. You can especially see it there in the reflections. And then I also want to be able to control the roughness values later in the custom node group. So what we can do is just search for a hue saturation value and stick it between the noise and the color ramp. And that way we have a value, which is going to make it brighter or darker. So that'll control the roughness values. So we'll box select these nodes and we'll add a frame and we'll add a label. And I can just call this roughness. And so that's it for the finished material. So let's now join it together into a node group. So I'll box select all the nodes, except the material output, and I'll press control G to join it together into a node group. I'll hit the tab key to go outside the node group. We'll drag the node group over here. Let's make it bigger. And I can also give it the same name. So I'll just call it chipped paint. Let's hit the tab key to go into the node group and I'll hit the N key to open the side panel. And you can click on the group tab and you can now see we have these group sockets. So right over here on the group input, we can plug up the values to this group input, and then we'll be able to control them outside of the node group. So first I want to control the overall scale and the mapping here is plugged up to all the textures. So the scale will control the size of the entire material. So I'll put the scale at the extra socket. Let's click on the scale, but you can see it's three values and I want it to be one value. So we'll change the type here to float instead. And then that way it's one value. We'll turn the default value to one. And then if I hit tab to go out of the node group, we'll turn the scale back to one. Now we can control the entire scale. So we'll go back into the node. And the next value that I want to control is the metallic. So I'll drag the group input over here and drag it down here. And you can see there is a metallic value. So let's put the metallic into the extra socket. And then I want to control the paint color and the metal color. So I'll plug this one into there and then this base color into there. Let's drag this down here so I can see it. And this one we're going to call paint color. And then this one here, we're going to rename to a metal color. Then I want to control the distortion. So I'll drag the group input right back here. And you can see on the distortion, this linear light here has this factor, which is going to make the chip paint more and less distorted. So I'll put that into the extra socket and I'll just rename this to distortion. Then I want to control the chip scale, which is controlled by this Voronoi here in the chip. So let's put the scale into the extra socket and we'll rename that to chip scale. Then I want to control the chip individual size, which is going to be controlled by this value here. You can see I can make it lighter and darker. So put the value into the extra socket and I'll rename that to chip individual size. And then also let's take the detail from the Voronoi, put that into the extra socket. And this one I'll rename to chip detail. Then I want to control the roughness scale. So that's controlled by this noise here in the roughness. So put the scale into the extra socket and I'll rename this to roughness scale. You could also control like the detail and the roughness and the distortion if you want to. Then I want to control the roughness value. So that's controlled by this hue saturation value to make it lighter and darker. So we'll put that into the extra socket and we'll just call that roughness. And then finally, I want to control the bump strength. So we can take the bump here, put the strength into the extra socket, and I'll just rename this to bump strength. I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. I can drag the group input back here and I can hit tab to go outside the node group. And there we go. There's the finished material. So I'll just review the material. So we have the overall scale, then we have the metallic value. We also have the paint color and we also have the metal color. Then we have the distortion. We also have the chip scale. Then we have the chipped individual size. So I can just turn this up kind of like this far or turn it down to control the size of that. And then we also have the chip detail. So that's the detail on the edges. Then we also have the roughness scale, the overall roughness, and then finally the bump strength.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrdMttWOhE0,Procedural Scratched Plastic Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural scratched plastic material using a custom node setup. The tutorial includes steps for setting up nodes to control various aspects of the material, such as scale, color, subsurface scattering, roughness, and scratch details. The video also explains how to organize the nodes into a custom node group for easier customization and offers the option to purchase the procedural material or an Ultimate Procedural Material Pack through links provided in the description. The tutorial concludes with a brief overview of setting up the 3D viewport and lighting to visualize the material effectively.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll be showing you how to create this procedural scratched plastic material. So here is the procedural node setup, and then after we create the node setup, I'll be showing you how to join together into this custom node group so you can customize the look of the material. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material to use in your projects, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page, links are in the description. So we have this scale value here to change the size of the entire material, and that'll also change the size of the scratches. Then we also have the plastic color, so that's just the base color for the plastic, so I just have it as kind of a blue color. Then we also have the subsurface, so if you want to allow a little bit of light to go through the plastic, you can turn up the subsurface a bit. Then we also have the roughness of the material, so you can make it more of a rough plastic or a really shiny plastic. Then we have two settings for the roughness, so we have the noise roughness scale, because there's a little bit of variation in the roughness, and then also the noise roughness detail. Then we have the scratches color, so right now I have the scratches color at just a slightly lighter color, so it's almost as if a little bit of the plastic has been scratched away, so the plastic is a little bit lighter underneath, but you can change the scratches color right there. Then we also have the scratches detail, so if you want less detail, you can turn that down, and now the scratches are more smooth, or you can turn them up and make them really detailed. And then we also have this distortion value to kind of add distortion to the scratches. Now there's actually two different scratches textures which are overlaid on top of each other. So this is the first one, the scratches scale 1, and then we also have this thickness value here, which is going to change the thickness of those scratches. Then we have the scratches scale 2, which is the second texture, and then we have the scratches thickness, so you can turn that up if you want more scratches and have them be a bit thicker. Then we have two bump strengths, so the scratches bump strength, and then also the noise bump strength, which is just some subtle noise over the plastic. So if you'd like to purchase this procedural material, you can get that with the links in the description. And if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials, you can check out my Ultimate Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my materials pre-set up for Blender's Asset Browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. And you'll also get future updates with new procedural materials. And to learn how to create more materials, you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu, and I just added an icosphere, and then right behind me on the add icosphere settings, I turned the subdivisions to six. You can use the object context menu and shade the object smooth. And then I just scaled the object down to like a 0.2, because the default objects in Blender are kind of large, and I'll hit Ctrl-A and apply the scale, so that's the new default size of the object. Then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the object. And if you select the camera, and then go right over here to the object data properties of the camera, I turned the focal length up to 80, just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit. And then I also added some area lights, so you can see I added these two different area lights right here. So this area light here, the power is set to 50, and then the other area light here, the power is set to 10. So with this area light, it's kind of large here up on the top, kind of shining down. And then for this other area light, this one is kind of in the background, just to give a bit of a rim light to the object. Now I also added in this HDRI from polyhaven.com, so link is in the video description if you'd like to download it, and I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So if you go here to the world properties, you can click on the yellow dot next to color, you can choose environment texture, and then just click on the open button and open up the texture to add in the HDRI to get some realistic lighting. And then also if you click here to go to the render properties, and go down here to the film tab, I checkmarked the transparent button just so that you can't see the HDRI in the background. And also if you open up the color management, I'm using AGX and very high contrast to make things look more contrasty. So I'm over here in the shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered viewport mode, and I have the shader editor right over here, so I'll just select the object and click on new to add a new material, and I'll just rename the material. Now I'm also going to be using the node wrangler addon in the video, so if you don't have that enabled, you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences, and then over here on the addons tab, you can just search for a node, and just enable the node wrangler addon, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So let's start by creating the base texture for the scratches, so to do this, I'm going to search for the magic texture. We'll drop it here, and then I'll hold down the ctrl and shift key and select the magic texture to preview it on the object. Now also with the magic texture selected, I'll hit ctrl T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now I'm going to use the object coordinates, so we'll put the object into the vector, because the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. And now let's change some of the settings of the magic texture, so I like turning the depth up to 5, I think that looks pretty good for this texture, but you can play around with the depth and try them out if you like a different one. And then also I'm going to turn the scale to 3, and also the distortion to 3. So turning up the distortion is really going to give us all that detail there which we can use to make the scratches. Now I just want to isolate the scratches so you can only see the scratches but not anything else, so to do that we can make it more contrasty by searching for a color ramp. We'll put the color ramp here after the magic texture, and then I can drag the black tab out, but then I'll also drag the white tab out much closer to the black texture, and now you can see we're just getting that scratches texture. Now I want to make these scratches look a lot more distorted and noisy to look more realistic, so let's drag the texture coordinate and mapping back. And I'm going to be searching for a noise texture to distort the magic texture, so I'll drop this down here. Let's Ctrl-Shift-select the noise texture to preview it, and we can also use the same object coordinates, so we'll put the mapping vector into the vector of the noise texture. And now we can play around with the settings, so I'm going to turn the scale down to like a 2, and I'll turn the detail up to like a 10. So now what I want to do is put this into the magic texture through the vector to distort it, but I want to control how distorted it is. So what we're going to do is search for a mix color, and we're going to put the mix color here after the mapping, but before the magic. So now the noise texture factor can go into color B, and then the mapping vector, that can go into color A. So now if I Ctrl-Shift-select the color ramp, you can see if I look here really closely at one of the scratches, it looks really noisy. And I can drag the factor around to distort it. Now the texture is being moved around a lot, so to make that not happen, I can click on the mix here, and I can change it to linear light. And this way as I drag the factor, it is going to distort it, but it's not going to move around quite as much. So for the factor here, I find that a 0.13 looks pretty good, just a 0.13. So now we have that nice distortion there on the scratches. Now I like to keep my nodes nicely organized, so it's really easy to remember what everything does. So I'll click and drag the box like these nodes, I'll hit Ctrl-J to add a frame. So these are the mapping nodes, so I'm going to select the frame here and press F2 to add a label, and I can call this mapping. I'm going to select these two nodes here, I'll hit Ctrl-J to add a frame and kind of compress them, hit F2 to give the frame a label, and I'm going to call this distortion. And then we can box select these two nodes here, and again hit Ctrl-J and F2 to add a label, and I'll just call this scratches, because those are the scratches texture. Now I want to add a lot more scratches, because we don't have very many scratches right now. So I'm going to be duplicating the texture, and then changing it a bit, and then mixing them together. So let's take the magic texture and the color ramp, and I'm going to press Ctrl-Shift-D. So Ctrl-Shift-D will duplicate the nodes, but keep the wires plugged up, we'll drop it down here, and let's Ctrl-Shift-select the color ramp to preview it. So now here on this scale, I'm just going to change the scale a little bit, so I'm just going to turn the scale to a 5. So you can now see we have some bigger scratches and some smaller scratches, so I now want to join them together. So if you hold down the Shift key and select both color ramps, you can hit Ctrl-0, and Ctrl-0 is going to add this mix color. I'll open it up, and I'm going to drag it here into the frame. So now the mix is going to mix them both together. Now on the mix type here, I'm going to change it to darken, because I just want to add both of the dark values of both of the textures. And then I can turn the factor all the way up to 1. So you can now see both of these textures here on the darkened result. Now I also want to control the size of the scratches when we add it to the node setup, so what I'm going to do is box select these nodes and bring them forward a bit, and then I'm just going to select the magic textures and I'm going to pull them back. In between the magic texture and the color ramp, I'm going to search for a hue saturation value, and I'll drop this here, and then we can kind of make this smaller, and I can duplicate the hue saturation value and drop it here, and then push these together. Now why we're using this node is because there's a value which we can drag to make it lighter and darker, and you can see that's changing the thickness of the scratches. So we'll be using this later in the custom node group. So now the scratch's texture is finished, we can put it into the normal to give it some bump. So we're going to put the darkened result into the normal, and I will just control shift select the principled shader to preview it. Now you can see there's some weird shading issues on the material, and that's because we need to convert the color data into normal data that the shader can use. So I'm going to go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a bump node, and we'll add the bump node here between the darkened and the normal. And then the darkened result can go into the height value, and that's going to convert it to bump data. And then here on the bump strength, I'm going to turn this down to like a 0.2, so the scratches aren't that big. But if I take the base color and just turn it down, you can kind of see the reflections better. So you can now use the bump strength to make the scratches look more small, or make them kind of scratched in a lot more into the plastic. Now I also want to make the scratches color be a little bit different. So let's take the result, and we're going to put that into the base color. So now you can see that the scratches are black, and then the rest of the material is white. But I want to control the colors and have custom colors. So to do this, we're going to search for a mix color, and we're going to put this between the darkened and the base color. And the darkened result can go into the factor. And so now the scratches texture is going to determine what part is going to be color A, and what part is going to be color B. So for color A, I'm just going to make this kind of like a light blue. And then for color B, I'm going to make this kind of like a dark blue. And if you want to use the same exact colors I'm using, you can punch in this hex value. So color A is going to be 4168C1FF. That is the light scratches. And then for just the main base color of the plastic, I'm going to be using this hex value, which is 304D8EFF. So now we have a nice blue plastic with some lighter scratches. Now I do just want to add a tiny little bit of noise over the surface, just to add a little bit of bump and make the plastic look slightly bumpy. So what I'm going to do is search for a noise texture. Let's drop it here. And then we also want to use the same object coordinates. So we'll take the mapping vector and put that into the vector of the noise. And then I don't really like it that the wire is overlapping here. So I'm going to hold down the shift key and right click and drag over this wire. And that's going to add a reroute. And I'll just put the reroute right there. So the setup just looks a little bit nicer. So let's control shift select the noise texture to preview it. And I'm going to change a few of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to a 16. And I want to turn the detail up just a little bit to like a 7. So it's somewhat detailed. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. So now what I want to do is put this into the bump. So we'll box select these nodes and drag them back a bit. And I can take this bump node and we'll hit shift D to duplicate it. We're going to drop it here after the first one. So now we have this extra height value that we can add data into. So we're going to take the noise texture factor. And we're going to put that into the height value of the bump. And I'll control shift select the principled shader to preview it. So there is the bump. But it is way too strong. And I just want to be a very subtle bump. So I'm going to turn this bump strength to a 0.01, just a 0.01. So if you zoom really close up to the reflections, there is just a tiny bit of surface bump over the plastic. But it is pretty subtle. I'm going to box select these nodes here and join them into a frame. And I'll add a label. And I'm just going to call this bump. Now I'm also going to use this noise texture. And I'm going to put it into the roughness to make a little bit of variation. So some parts are more shiny and other parts are more rough. But what I first want to do is change the colors. So we'll go to the add menu. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And we'll put the color ramp right here. So the factor now can go into the roughness there. But then I want to be able to control how rough and shiny it is. Because right now I don't really have any control over it. So we're going to put the color ramp here in between the noise factor and the roughness. So stick right there. So now what I can do is drag these tabs together. And if they're going together, they're going to be more contrasty. So you can kind of see the variation in the roughness. And then what I can do is change the colors. So if I make this black tab darker, you can see it's going to be a very shiny plastic. Or if I turn it up, it's going to be a more rough plastic. So I'm going to put this tab about here. And I'll leave it to fully black. And then the gray tab, I'll kind of do about here. And I'm going to make it this gray color. And if you want to use the same hex value I'm using, you can punch in A8, A8, A8FF. So now you can see it is a pretty shiny plastic. Now I also want to be able to control the roughness values in the node group. And so if we make the values lighter or darker, that's going to control the roughness. So what I can do is search for a hue saturation value. We'll put this here after the color ramp and before the roughness. And I'll just stick it right down here. So we now have this value which I can drag around to make the plastic more rough or make the plastic more shiny. So we'll be using that in the custom node group. I'm also going to box select these nodes and give them a frame and add a label. And I'll just call this noise because that's just a simple noise texture. Now the last thing that I want to do is add just a little bit of subsurface scattering in case you want some subsurface scattering to let a little bit of light to go through the plastic. So let's open up the subsurface here on the principal shader. And I'll turn the weight up to like a 0.2. You can turn it up more if you want to. You can kind of see it's a little bit subtle. It's a little bit hard to see in the scene. But there is going to now be a little bit of light going through the object. So that's going to be it for the procedural material. So let's now make it more useful by joining together into a node group so you can easily customize the material. So I'm going to click and drag and box select all the nodes except the material output. And I'll press control G to join together into a node group. Now if you hit the tab key to go out of the node group, let's drag the node group over here next to the material output. And I'm going to make it bigger. And then I can copy the material name and I'll paste it here into the node group. Now I also want to change the name here of the BSDF. I want to call it shader instead. So if I hit the tab key with the node group selected, that'll go back into the node group. And I'm going to hit the N key to open up the side panel. And then if you go to the group tab, you can double click here on the group sockets. And I'll just rename this to shader. So now outside the node group, it's called shader. So now if I go over here to this side, we have the group input. And we can plug up all the values to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures. So the mapping scale will control the size of the entire material. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket here. And if I click on the scale, you can see it's going to be three values. But I just want it to be one value instead. So what we're going to do is change the vector to float. And then I want to turn the default value to 1. But the texture is still gone. That's because I need to go outside the node group. And I need to turn the scale to 1. So I can now go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the plastic color. So I'll drag the group input way over here. Let's drag it over here. And this darker blue here, that's going to be the plastic color. So I'll put color B into the extra socket. Let's double click on this to rename it. And I'll rename it to plastic color. And then also I want to control the subsurface. So I'll put the weight here into the extra socket. And then if I drag this down here, I'm just going to rename this to subsurface. Then I want to control the roughness of the plastic. So we have this value here which is going into the roughness to change the roughness. So I'll put the value into the extra socket. Let's rename this to roughness. Then I want to control some more of the roughness values. So if I drag the input back here, we have this noise texture. And we have the scale values and the detail to kind of control that roughness. So I'll put the scale and the detail, both of these, into these extra sockets. And I'm going to call this one noise roughness scale. And then this one I'm going to call noise roughness detail. Then I want to control the scratches color. So I'll drag the node group back over here. And we can take this mix. We can take color A and put that into the extra socket. And then this one I can rename to scratches color. Then I'm going to control the detail of the scratches. So I'll drag the node group back over here. And this noise texture here has a detail value which is making the scratches look more detailed. So I'll put the detail into the extra socket. And then let's rename this to scratches detail. Now this linear light right here, this factor is going to distort the scratches more and less. So I'll put the factor into the extra socket. And I'll call this scratches distortion. Then I want to control the scale of each one of the scratch textures. So if I drag this right down here, we have these two magic textures. So I'll put this scale here into the extra socket. And this one I'm going to call scratches scale one. And then we have this value here which is going to make it more thick and more visible. Or you can keep it down. So I'll put the value into the extra socket. And this one I'm going to call scratches thickness one. Then I'll do the same thing for these two. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket. And also the value into the extra socket. And then I'm going to copy the material name and paste it here into this one. But this is going to be scratches scale two. And the same thing. So copy this one and paste it here. And this will be scratches thickness two. So now we have a lot of different details to change how the scratches are looking. And then finally I want to control the bump strength. So we'll drag the group input right over here. And this first bump here, that's making the scratches more bumpy. So I'll put the strength into the extra socket. And this one I'm going to call scratches bump strength. And then the last one here is just that noise. So I'll put the strength into the extra socket. And this one we'll rename it to noise bump strength. All right. I'm going to drag the node group right over here back to the very starting. And I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. And the tab key to go outside the node group. And there is the finished procedural material. So we can just review the material to make sure everything works. So we have the overall scale. Then we have the plastic color. Then also the subsurface. We can also change the roughness. We also have the noise roughness scale and the noise roughness detail. And then also just the scratches color. Then we have the scratches detail. So if I kind of zoom way in here, I can change the detail of those scratches. Also the distortion of the scratches. And then we have scratches scale one. And then we also have scratches thickness one. So if you want like a lot of scratches, you can turn this way up. You can see now it looks really scratched. And then we have scratches scale two and scratches thickness two. And then we have the bump strength of the scratches. And then also just a noise bump strength to make the plastic look just very slightly bumpy on the surface. So that'll be it for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed this and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2_u458H5Mk,How to Make Easy Procedural Scratches (Blender Tutorial),"The video provides a step-by-step tutorial on creating a procedural scratches texture in Blender using a node setup. The presenter demonstrates how to utilize a magic texture with a color ramp to create the base of the scratches texture and adds more detail using a noise texture for distortion. The tutorial also shows how to integrate this texture into different material properties, such as bump and roughness, to achieve various effects like a plastic material with noticeable scratches. Additionally, the video mentions an upcoming tutorial on creating a procedural scratch plastic material, with a link to be provided in the description once it is released.","In this video, I'll be showing you a really easy procedural node setup to create a procedural scratches texture in Blender. So you could use this scratches texture for many different materials, like a metal material, a wood material, or a plastic material. And if you'd like to create a procedural scratch plastic material with this node setup, then I'll be releasing this video soon on how to create a procedural scratch plastic material. You can find the link in the description to that video when it's released. So here I am in Blender, I just went to the Shading workspace, and I just added a smooth icosphere, and then I also just added a very basic lighting setup. And we're going to start by searching for a magic texture. And let's hold down the Ctrl and Shift key to preview the magic texture. With the magic texture selected, let's also press Ctrl T. That's using the feature of the Node Wrangler add-on. And I want to put the object into the vector there of the mapping, so it's using the object coordinates, so the texture will be placed on the object more evenly. Now I do want to change a few settings of the magic texture. So I'm going to turn the depth up to 5, because I like how that looks, but you could play around with the different depth values. And then here on the scale, I'm going to turn this to 3. And then also on the distortion, I'll turn this to 3 as well. So you can see by turning up the distortion value, it's going to give the texture a lot more detail. Now you might be wondering how we can turn this into a scratches texture. Well, what we can do is make it more contrasty, so we can only see some of these lines here. So what I want to do is search for a color ramp, and we'll put the color ramp after the magic texture. And then I'm going to drag the white tab way over and drag the black tab over just a little bit. And so you can see by dragging them really close together over here on the side of the color ramp, you can only see a few of those values. That's the base of the scratches texture. Now I do want to add a lot more detail to this, because a lot of these scratches look really smooth, and I want them to look a bit more rough and random. So I'm going to select the mapping and texture coordinate and bring them back. And what I can do is go to the add menu and search for a noise texture. And if we put the noise texture in between the mapping and magic, if we stick it right here, it's going to go through the vector, so that way the noise texture is going to distort the magic texture. Now let's change a few of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to like a 2, and I can also turn the detail up to like a 10, so it's more detailed. So you can see by dragging that detail there, it's going to change the distortion of those scratches. But I also want a bit more control over how strong the noise texture is affecting the magic texture. So what I'm going to do is go to the add menu and search for a mix color. And we'll drop this between the noise and the magic. And we're going to take the vector, and we're going to put that into color A from the mapping. And then we're going to take the noise factor, and we're going to put that into color B. So now we have this factor, which is going to drag between only using color A or only using color B. And color B is the noise, so it's distorted, but then color A is the mapping, which isn't distorted. Now you can see the scratches are all moving around, so to make them not moving around so much, I can change the mix type here to linear light. Now when I drag the factor, it's going to distort the texture, but it's not going to move them around so much. So now if I just look here at one of the scratches, I can drag this value, and you can see it's going to distort it more or less. So I like turning this factor just to like maybe a 0.1. So now you can see here on the scratches, it's just a little bit distorted and a bit noisy. And so that is the base texture for the scratches. So now you can do many things with this. So for example, you could put the color into the normal, and then you could search for a bump node to convert it to bump data, stick that here. So the color can go into the height value, and the bump can go into the normal. So now if I Ctrl-Shift-Select the Principled Shader to preview it, let's just like turn the base color down. And now you can see we have all those scratches there in the bump, and you can adjust the strength with that. Another thing you could do is you could put it into the roughness. I'm going to put this into the roughness instead, and then I need to change the roughness values. And so to change the roughness values, you can make the texture lighter and darker. So what I'm going to do is click on the black tab, and I can make the black tab lighter, and that's going to make it more rough. But if I click on the white tab and make it darker, that's going to make it more shiny. And now you can see we kind of have like a plasticky material. Maybe I'll just like make the base color like a blue color or something. You can now see we have like a plastic material, but where the scratches are, they look a lot more rough. So that's another example of how you can use it. Another thing you could do is put the color ramp color into the base color, and then to add custom colors, you could search for a mix color node and put it between the color ramp and the base color, and you can put the color ramp into the factor. So now we have color A, and if I change color A, that's going to be the scratches. So maybe I'll just make it like a black color or a dark gray. And then for color B, this is going to be the rest of the material. So maybe I'll just make this again like a blue color, turn the roughness down. So now if I zoom in here, you can see just where the scratches are. That is going to be color A, which is the dark color, and then color B is going to be the rest of the material. And if you'd like to watch this tutorial on how to create a procedural scratch plastic, you can find that video link in the description when the tutorial is released. But I hope you found this helpful, and thanks for watching."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga1glCkgKAY,Procedural Black Leather Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor demonstrates how to create a procedural black leather material and organize it into a custom node group for easy customization. The tutorial covers adjusting various parameters, including scale, crack scale, dot scale, voronoi scale, base color, roughness, and bump strengths, to achieve different leather appearances. The instructor also explains how to set up a scene with lighting and an environment texture to showcase the material. Additionally, viewers are encouraged to support the channel by purchasing the material on Gumroad or Patreon and are invited to explore further tutorials and material packs offered by the creator.","In this blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural black leather material. And then after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group so you can customize the look of the material. So we first have this scale value which you can use to change the size of the entire material. Then we also have just the crack scale so there's some little bits of cracks there on the leather. Then there's also a dots texture so you can use that to change the dot scale. And then finally this voronoi scale. Then there is the base color so of course it doesn't have to be black if you don't want to. You could make it more like a dark brown leather or you could make it more of like a dark red leather or whatever leather color you want but it's going to be black as the default. Then we also have the roughness of the leather. And then we also have three bump strengths. So the first one is this voronoi bump strength. You can kind of see what that looks like. Then there's also the dots bump strength which is that little dots texture. And then at the very end here there's the cracks bump strength which is that cracks texture. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this procedural material you can get that on my gumroad store and my patreon page linked in the video description. You can also get all of my materials in my ultimate blender procedural material pack which comes with all of my procedural materials pre-set up from blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. Or you can purchase my procedural material packs which are just packs of 10 different materials. And to learn how to create more materials you can check out my blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on youtube. So before we make the material I'll show you what I have set up in the 3d viewport. So I went to the add menu and I went here to mesh and I just added an icosphere. And then right behind me on the add icosphere settings I turned the subdivisions up to 6 so it is nice and smooth and round. And I also used the object context menu and shaded it smooth. And then I scaled the object down to a 0.2 just a 0.2 press ctrl a and then apply the scale so that's the object's new default size. Then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera at the object. And if you select the camera and then click over here to go to the object data properties of the camera I turn the focal length up to 80 just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit. Now for the lighting I added these different area lights right here so if you go to the add menu you can go to light and you can just choose an area light. So for this first area light here it was kind of on the top pointing down and I set the power to 100 and it's just a white color. And then for the other area light here this one is kind of on the back to add just a bit of a rim light kind of here on the back of the sphere and I set the power to 15 and just gave it a white color. And then also to get some nice realistic lighting I added in this photo studio 01 from polyhaven.com so the link will be in the description if you want to download the same hdri. And then to add in the hdri you can go here to the world properties you can click on the yellow dot next to color and you can choose environment texture and then just click on the open button and open up the hdri. And then I just left the strength set to 1. Now to make the background transparent so you can't see the hdri you can go up here to the render properties and you can open up the film tab and if you want to you can just check mark the transparent button so the hdri will still light the scene but you can't see it in the background. And then also I opened up the color management and I set the view transform to agx and I turned the look to very high contrast just to pop out the colors and make it more contrasty and saturated. So I'm in the shading workspace so I have the 3d viewport right over here and I'm in rendered mode and then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'm just going to select the object we'll click on new to add a new material and I'm just going to name this black leather. And then I'll also be using the node wrangler add-on in the video so to enable the node wrangler you can click on edit you can go to the preferences and then on the add-ons tab just search for node and you can just enable the node wrangler add-on in the user preferences. So I'll close the user preferences. So to start off I'm going to take the base color here and I'm going to make it fully black so now it's a nice black color and then also I'll turn the roughness down to like a 0.4 so it's a little bit more shiny. So let's now start by creating the cracks texture. So for the cracks texture we're going to search for a voronoi. Let's drop the voronoi here and I can hold down the ctrl and shift key and select the voronoi texture and that's going to preview it on the object. Now also with the voronoi texture selected I'll press ctrl t and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping and I'm going to plug the object into the vector because the object coordinates are going to place the texture on the object more evenly. So we can now change the voronoi settings. So I'm going to take the f2 here and I'm going to change it to distance to edge and this will give us some cracks. Then I'm going to turn the scale way up so we can see more of them so I'll turn it to 150 and I'll turn the detail up to a small value of just like a 0.5. So if you zoom in there there is a tiny bit of detail but I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now I want to distort the voronoi with another texture so it looks kind of distorted and more random. So I'm going to go to the add menu and I'll search for a noise texture and we'll drop the noise texture down here and let's ctrl shift select the noise texture to preview it and I'm going to use the same object coordinates so we'll put the vector into the vector of the noise and we'll change the noise settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 30 and I'll turn the detail up to 10 so it is pretty detailed and I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now this noise texture we're going to put the factor into the vector of the voronoi so now if I preview the voronoi texture you can see the noise is distorting it however it's way too distorted so I want it to be more subtle so I'm going to go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a mix color and we're going to put the mix color here after the noise so just stick it right there and we're going to put the mapping vector which isn't distorted into color A and then the noise texture factor that is going to go into color B. So now we're mixing between the not distorted texture and the noise which is distorted. Now in the mix type here I'm going to change this to linear light and I can now drag the factor back and forth so if it's turned to zero it's not distorted at all so it's using color A but then as I turn the factor up more and more it's using more of color B which is the noise. Now I'm going to turn this to a very small number of 0.018 so 0.018 so now you can see that the voronoi texture the cracks there they are distorted just a little bit so it looks more random. Now I want to make the voronoi more contrasty because I want these cracks to be a lot smaller so we'll go to the add menu we're going to search for a color ramp we'll put this after the voronoi and then I'm going to change the values here these tabs here of the color ramp so if I drag the white tab over you can see that's making it more contrasted so now the black parts are really small so it's going to make those cracks look really small. So now I want to make another texture which is going to be kind of like a bumpy random texture so what I'm going to do is select the voronoi and the color ramp and I'm going to duplicate them so hit shift d we'll drop it down here and I'll ctrl shift select the color ramp. First let's make the color ramp less contrasty so I'm going to drag the white tab maybe over here and the black tab I'll kind of drag this over to about here and then we need to change the voronoi settings and I also do want to use the object coordinates so for now let's just take the mapping vector and put that into the vector of the voronoi and then to change the voronoi settings we'll click on the distance to edge and I'm going to turn this to f1 instead and now you can see that better so now what I'm going to do is drag the black tab kind of do about there and the white tab kind of do about there and then we can change the settings so I want to make this a bit bigger so this voronoi scale is going to be 200 so it's a bit smaller but then I'll leave the other settings how they are now I also want to distort this texture so it looks just more distorted and random but I want to distort it a bit more than this linear light which isn't too distorted so I'm going to select the linear light and I'll press ctrl shift d so ctrl shift d is going to duplicate the nodes but it will keep the wires plugged up and I'll just drop this down here and we can take the result and we can replace it for the vector so this way we're still using the mapping but this noise texture is going through the mix here the linear light so the noise texture is distorting it a little bit and then of course I can use the same value so the factor and if it's zero it's not distorted at all but then as I turn up more and more it's going to be more distorted so I'm going to turn this to a 0.07 just a 0.07 so now you can see it looks kind of distorted and random and I actually think that using the color of the noise texture looks a little bit better from the factor the factor is the same texture but it's black and white and the color one has color values so I'm just going to replace the color here into color b so I'm just replacing that factor and the same thing for this one here so I'm going to use the color instead put that into color b so we're using the color instead of the factor now I'm also going to add one more voronoi texture which is going to be some little dots because if you look really close up at leather usually has a bunch of little circles or little dots so we're going to take one of these voronois I'm going to duplicate it with shift d and we're just going to drop it down here now if you select the voronoi texture you can hit the backspace and that's going to reset all the settings so it's back to the default so now here on the scale I'm going to turn this to like 1000 on the scale if I control shift and selected a preview you can now see it's really small and also let's use the same mapping here and texture coordinate because I want to use the object coordinates so we'll put the mapping vector into the vector there so it's using the object coordinates but now by turning the scale to a thousand it's going to be a really small texture but then I do want to add just a little bit of detail so I'll turn the detail to like a 0.5 so now you can see that each one of those dots just has a tiny little bit of detail if you zoom up close so that's it for the textures so we have this group of textures we have this group of textures and then we have this group of textures so we're going to be putting these all into the bump to give it some nice detail in the bump so to put it into the normal here we first need to search for a bump node so add the bump node and we need to use the bump node because this here is normal data it's a purple dot but then this here is black and white data because it's gray or it's color because it is yellow and so we need to convert the black and white data or the color data into normal data that the shader can use so because we have three different textures here we're going to be using three different bumps so first let's just control shift select the principal shader and then I'm going to take the first bump normal and we're going to put that into the normal then we're going to take the bump node and I'll hit shift d to duplicate it we'll drop it here after the first one and then again shift d to duplicate and we'll drop it here after this one so you can now see we have three different bump maps and so to convert the textures into bump data we're going to put them into the height value so if I control shift select this last bump here you can see here it is right now it looks really smooth so for the first one we're going to take this one here which is this voronoi texture here this is the cracks so we're going to put the color into the height value and now you can see it looks really bumpy there on the surface but that is a bit too strong so I'm going to take the strength and turn it down to like a 0.15 so you can now see it's much more subtle now for the second one we're going to take this bottom voronoi here which is the dots so we'll take the distance value and we're going to put that into the height value of the second bump so now if I zoom in you can see it looks really bumpy there's all these little dots but you can see the dots are going back in instead of popping out so we're going to turn on this invert button and now you can see all those little dots there are popping out instead of going back in and it's also a bit too strong so I'm going to make it the same strength value I think a 0.15 looks pretty good so now you can see that there's just those little dots there on top of those cracks and then finally the last one is just this voronoi which is just kind of a random texture so we're going to put the color ramp color here into the height value of the final bump and now you can see that adds a lot more detail but it is way too strong so I'm going to turn the strength to like a 0.1 now I find that also turning this one with the inverted on looks a bit better if I just turn up the bump strength you can see here it is inverted and here it is without so I actually like the inverted I'm going to keep it inverted and then of course the strength at a 0.1 so now I have three different bumps here adding a lot of detail to the surface of the leather so I can ctrl shift select the principal shader and there we go there is our finished detailed black leather material so if I zoom in really close you can kind of see we have those dots there and also kind of just the random texture but then if you zoom out a bit you can definitely see all those little cracks there on the surface of the leather so that's it for the procedural material so we're now going to join it together into a custom node group so we're going to click and drag the box like all the nodes except the material output and we're going to press ctrl g and ctrl g will join it together into a node group let's hit the tab key to go outside the node group and I'll drag the node group over here next to the material output now let's just drag it out to make it a bit bigger and then if I just hit ctrl c here to copy the material name I can click here and press ctrl v just to paste that so now the node group is called black leather as well as the material so let's hit the tab key to go into the node group and I'll hit the n key to open up the side panel and if you click on the group tab we have the group sockets and so we can plug up all the custom values and control them outside the node but first what I want to do is change the name here so if I double click on it to rename it I'll just call it shader because I like that better now if I go right over here we have the group input and so we can plug all the values into the group input to control them outside of the node so this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures so the scale value is going to control the size of the entire material so let's put the scale into the group input here and then if we click on the scale it's going to be three values but instead of it being three values I want it to be one value so we'll click on the type here and we're going to change it to float and that's just going to make it one value now on the default value I want to turn this to one but you can see the texture is still missing that's because we need to hit the tab key to go outside the node group and we need to turn the scale back to one so now that's going to control the size of the entire material so we'll hit tab to go back into the node now the next value that I want to control is the cracks scale so if I drag the group input up here to this top voronoi we have this scale value so put that into the extra socket and we'll double click on this to rename it and we'll rename this to cracks scale then the next one that I want to control is the dot scale so we'll drag the group input down here and we can take the voronoi scale this bottom one we'll put the scale into the extra socket and let's double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to dot scale and then the last one is going to be the voronoi scale here in the middle so we'll put the scale into the extra socket and this one you could rename it to like leather scale or whatever you want to call it I'm going to call it voronoi scale now if you want to you could also control a lot of the other values you could control the roughness values and the detail values you could also control the factors here of these linear lights if you want to distort them more or also this noise scale and I think actually controlling the top linear light might be kind of useful for the other ones it doesn't seem to change the material that much it doesn't make the material look too different but we do have this linear light factor and that is making the cracks more or less distorted so we'll put the factor into the extra socket and this one I'll rename this to cracks distortion so of course you can add in any of the other values if you want to but I'm now going to drag the group input right over here and we can take the base color put that into the extra socket and then also the roughness we give it that into the extra socket and then finally I want to control the three bump strengths so the first one here this is the cracks bump strength so we're going to put the strength into the extra socket let's drag this down so we can see it and this one I'm gonna rename to cracks bump strength then for the next one here this is going to be the dots because you can see the dots texture is going into it so I'll put the strength into the extra socket and this one I'm gonna rename to dots bump strength and then the last one here was just that voronoi so I'll put the strength into the extra socket and this one I'll just rename to voronoi bump strength okay I'll drag the group input right back over here I'll hit the n key to close the side panel and I'll hit the tab key outside the node group and there's the final material so we can just review the material settings so we have the scale to change the size of the entire material then we also just have the crack scale and the dot scale and the voronoi scale if you do want to change that and then we also have the cracks distortion so if I turn this down you can kind of see the cracks a little bit better but I like having a little bit of distortion because it makes them a bit more random then we have the base color so of course you could make this like any leather color you want I think making kind of like a really dark brown looks pretty nice or you could also make like a dark red that looks pretty cool then we have the roughness of the material and then we have the cracks bump strength we have the dots bump strength and then also the voronoi bump strength so that'll be it for this tutorial so I hope you found this helpful and thank you for

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZDaxZFERqQ,Procedural Worn Painted Metal Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural worn painted metal material and organize it into a custom node group for customization. The tutorial covers various aspects of creating the material, such as adjusting the scale, defining paint wear with two different levels of detail, and controlling rust amount and appearance. It also guides on setting custom colors for paint, metal, and rust, and tweaking roughness and bump strength for each. Additionally, the creator mentions selling the material and procedural material packs on Gumroad and Patreon, and introduces a separate course on creating a rusty fire hydrant in Blender, detailing steps from modeling to rendering.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural worn painted metal material. And then after we create the procedural material, I'll be showing you how to join it together into a custom node group so you can customize the look of the material. So we first have this scale value, so you can change the size of the material depending on the size of your object. Then we also have Paint Wear 1, so this is kind of those large chunks of paint wear, and so you can see that as the paint is wearing away, there's basically metal underneath the paint. And then there's also Paint Wear 2, and this one is more detailed and it kind of has all those little dots there. Then we also have the Rust Amount, so you can make more rust or less rust. And you can see right here on the edges of where the paint is wearing away, that's where the rust is showing up more. So you can just turn it down and there's just a little bit of rust, or you can turn it up if you want lots of rust. Then we also have the different custom colors. So there's the paint color, so you can change that just for the base color of the paint. Then there is that metal color which is underneath the paint. And then there is also the rust color. Then there's also the metal roughness, so that's just the roughness of the metal. Then there is the paint roughness, and then there's also the rust roughness. And then we have some bump strength, so the rust bump strength and the metal bump strength. And then also this worn bump strength, and this is like the main bump here which is going to make that worn part there look more chunky or more smooth. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material and help support the channel, you can purchase the material on my gumroad store and my patreon page. I'll have the links in the description.

You can also purchase my procedural material packs which are packs of 10 materials, and you can learn how to create any of my procedural materials by checking out my blender procedural material tutorial playlist. And then just one more thing before we start, I wanted to let you know about my rusty fire hydrant blender tutorial series. So it's a four-part tutorial series, and throughout the tutorial series I show you step-by-step in real time how to create this rusty fire hydrant. So we start by modeling the fire hydrant, and then we do the lighting and set up the materials. And then we do texture painting, and we texture paint where we want the paint to be worn away, and texture paint where we want the rust to show up on the model. And then we render out the finished rusty fire hydrant. If you'd like to check out the course trailer video, I'll have the links in the description, and the course product pages will be linked in the description. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu, and I went to mesh, and I added an icosphere. And then if you click right behind me on the add icosphere settings, I turned the subdivisions up to six, and then I shaded the object smooth, and then I scaled the object down by 0.2, and pressed ctrl a, and just applied the scale. So that's a better size when modeling to the real life scale in blender. I'll just move this over here. Also go to the add menu, and add a cube, and I'll scale the cube down by 0.2, press ctrl a, and apply the scale. Let's now go into edit mode, and maybe just scale the cube a little bit more down. And then I can press ctrl b, and I can scroll my mouse wheel to add cuts to the bevel, and just place that right there. Go back to object mode, and shade it smooth, and then I can just kind of rotate this, and stick it over here. Then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera, and go to the object data properties, I turned the focal length up to 60, to kind of zoom the camera in a bit. And then I also added this light here, so this is just an area light. The power is set to 10, and it's just a white color. But then I also went over here to the world properties, and I added in the SmallHanger02 HDRI from polyhaven.com. I'll have the link in the description. And after you download the HDRI, I clicked on the yellow dot here next to color, and I chose environment texture. And then you can just click on the open button, and open up the downloaded HDRI. And I just downloaded the 1k HDR version on polyhaven. Let's also go up here to the render properties, and on the film tab here, I check mark the transparent button, just so you can't see the HDRI in the background. And then also, if you open up the color management here, I'll be using the filmic view transform, and I'll set the look to very high contrast. So I'm now going to click right over here to go to the shader editor, and I'm just going to select the object. Let's click on new to add a new material, and I'll click here on the material drop down, and drop it here. So we have the same material on both objects. And so here's the shader nodes. Now I am also going to be using the node wrangler add-on. So to enable that, you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences, and then here on the add-ons tab, just search for node, and you can just enable the node wrangler add-on. So the first thing that I want to do is create two masks, and they're both going to be where the paint is worn away. So one of them is going to be like where those larger chunks are, and then the other one are going to be those kind of little speckles. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a noise texture, drop it here, and I'll hold down the ctrl and shift key and select the noise texture to preview it on the object. Now also with the noise texture selected, I'll press ctrl t, that is using the feature of the node wrangler, and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I want to use the object coordinates, so I'll put the object into the vector, and the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. So now we can change them as settings in the noise texture. So I'm going to turn the scale to 16, and I'll turn the detail up to the max of 15, and I'll also turn the roughness up just a little bit to like a 0.6. Now I want to make it much more contrasty, so I will go to the add menu, and I will search for a color ramp, and we'll put that here after the noise texture. So now I'll drag the black tab together and the white tab together, and we're going to make it super contrasty. So this is going to be the mask for just where the paint has been worn away, so just like that. Now I also want to be able to control this later in the node group. I want to be able to control how much the paint has worn away, so I'm going to search for a hue saturation value node, and I'll stick this between the noise texture and the color ramp. So now this value can make it lighter and darker, and so you can see that is going to change how the texture looks. So I want to keep the nodes nicely organized because the node setup will get kind of large, so I'm going to box select these nodes here and press ctrl j to add a frame, box select these nodes and press ctrl j to add a frame, and then if I select the frame I can press f2 to add a label, and I'm going to call it like paint mask 1, and this one here press f2 to add a label, and I'll just call this mapping. So now let's add the paint mask 2. So for this one I'm just going to box select all the nodes here, and I'll press ctrl shift d, so ctrl shift d will duplicate the nodes but keep the wires plugged up, and I'll ctrl shift and select this one to preview it. We can also click on the frame here and rename this, and I'll rename it to paint mask 2. So now we can change the settings for this one. So for this one I'll turn the scale to 10, and I'll leave the detail at 15, but I want to turn the roughness all the way up to 1 so it's going to be very detailed, and then we need to drag this out a bit so that it's not quite as contrasty. So can I drag these back so you can kind of see it better. So now if I zoom in here you can see we have those really subtle bits. You can see if I drag the black tab over you can definitely see how that's looking now. So I'll drag the black tab over here, but then I'll also drag the white tab to about here, so something like that. So now you can see there's all these just little tiny amounts of detail, and we're going to be adding that to make a bit more kind of rust and wear. And then we have the hue saturation value which is going to make it lighter and darker, and that is it for the two masks. So now I want to create the metal material, and we're going to be creating a few different materials because there's different materials. There's the paint, there's the metal, and the rust. So we'll create a few different materials and then join them together. So let's create the metal material. So I can just drag the principled shader up here, and we'll use this for the metal material. So I'm going to go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. I want to put this noise texture into the roughness value just to make it look a little bit different so that some parts of the metal are more rough and other parts are more shiny. Now let's hold down the ctrl and shift key and select the principled shader, and let's actually make this principled shader look like metal. So I can turn the metallic value all the way up to one, and then I can just for now turn the roughness down a bit. And then for the base color here, I'm just going to make it kind of like a mid-gray color. And if you want to use the same exact color I'm using for the base color, you can go to the hex value and you can punch in 797979. So I want to use the same mapping because I want to use the object coordinates. So let's take the vector here, and I can put that into the vector of the noise texture. And then I can take the noise texture factor, and I can put that into the roughness. So this noise texture is going to make some parts more rough and other parts more shiny. But I do want to change the settings, so let's turn the scale to 10, and also turn the detail all the way up to 15. And I'm going to turn this roughness value all the way up to 1. But I want to make it more contrasty, so let's search for a color ramp. We'll drop the color up here after the noise texture. And then I can drag these tabs around, and so you can see if it's more black it's more shiny, or if it's more white it's more rough. So I'm going to drag the white tab kind of to about here, and the black tab kind of to about there. So it looks pretty shiny, and now you can see it really is looking like a metal material. And then also let's search for a hue saturation value, and I'll drop it here after the color ramp. And we can use the value to make it lighter and darker, so that's going to control the roughness value. So we'll be using that later in the custom node group. Now I also want to add just a tiny little bit of bump. So let's select the noise texture, and I'll press ctrl shift d, and we're going to drop the noise texture here. And we can put the factor into the normal to give it some bump. But we need to convert it to bump data, so let's go to the add menu, and we can search for a bump node. And we're going to put the bump node here in between the principled shader and the noise texture, so just drop it there. And then we can take the noise texture factor, and we can put that into the height value to convert it to bump data. But that bump is too strong, so I'm going to turn the strength way down to like a 0.05, just a 0.05, so it is much more subtle. And let's also change the noise settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 5, and let's leave the detail at 15, and I'll turn the roughness down to just like a 0.7. So now you can see that's adding just a little bit of bump over the surface of the metal, but I do want to keep it kind of subtle for now. So we have a really cool detailed metal material there. So let's box select all these nodes here, and I can press ctrl j, and that's going to join them into a frame. I'll press f2 to give it a label, and just call it metal. So now we want to create the rust, so I'll go to the add menu, we're going to search for another principled shader, and I can ctrl shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And to make it look like rust, I'm going to turn the roughness up to like a 0.7. And then this base color, I'm going to make it kind of an orangey reddish color, and I'll make it really dark. And if you want to use the same color I'm using, the base color is going to be a hex value of 551200. So now I want to add a noise texture into the bump to make it look really bumpy. So let's search for a noise texture, we'll drop it here, and we can take the mapping of the texture coordinate here, the mapping, we'll put that to the vector so that it's using the object coordinates. And then we can take the noise texture factor, and we can put that into the normal. But again, we need to convert the black and white data into bump data. So we are going to search for a bump node, we'll put the bump node between the principled and the noise, and the factor can go into the height value to convert it to bump data. So now you can actually see it's making it look really bumpy. But right now it's looking like really wobbly, and it doesn't really look like rust. So let's turn the scale to like a nine. And I'll turn the detail all the way up to 15. And this roughness here, I'll just turn that up to like a point seven. Now it is a bit too strong. So this strength value, let's turn the strength down to just like a point two. And that way it's going to be less strong. But I can see we have this nice, simple rusty material. So I'll box like these nodes and add a frame, we can add a label, and I can just call it rust. So you can see we now have the metal and then also the rust. So then I also want to create the paint because the paint is going to be on top of the materials. So it is actually a different material, because the paint isn't metallic. So let's do that right here in front of the masks. So I'm going to search again for another principled shader, and we'll drop it here. And we can Ctrl Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And for the base color here, I'm going to make it a yellow color. But of course, you can make it any color you want for the metal. So I'm going to be using a hex value of E7 9C1C for that paint. And then also the roughness, I'll turn that down to like a point four. So the paint is a little bit more shiny. So now what I want to do is I want to join both of these paint masks together so that they are one mask. So to do this, to mix two colors together, we can search for a mix color. So mix color because we are mixing two colors together. Now you can see that on both of these masks, I just want to add the dark values, but I don't want to add the white values because that's not really a part of the texture. So on the mix type here, I can set it to darken. And then I can put the color into color A, and then this color into color B, and let's control shift and select the darken to preview it. And I can turn the factor all the way up to one, and that's ensuring that it's using both of them. So it's adding the dark values. So you can see now we have both of those masks together. So now this darken here, this can go into the normal. So again, what we're going to search for a bump node, just like we've done before, and the result can go into the height value, and then that can go into the normal. So if I control shift and select the principal shader, now you can see we have a really cool detailed texture, but I'm going to turn the bump strength down to just like a 0.3 so it is more subtle. Now I also want to put this bump strength into all of these other materials so that wherever the material is on the object, it's still going to have that bump. So I'm going to search for a bump node, and we'll drop the bump node right here. And then we're going to search for another bump node, and we're going to drop this one after this one. So drop that there. And then let's go here to this darken, and we're going to put the result into the height value of this one. So if we control shift and select this one, you can now see it's really bumpy, but I'm going to turn the strength way down to just like a 0.3. And then we can also do the same thing. So this darken result, this can go into the height value of this bump here. And then again, I want to turn the strength down to the same value of 0.3. So if I preview the rust, you can see it kind of has that bump there. And that's the same thing for the metal and the same thing for the principal shader. They all have the same bump, because the darken is going into those bumps of all the materials. So now we can just select these two nodes here, I'll press Ctrl J to add a frame, and I can add a label and I can just call this paint. Alright, so we have all the different shaders, but we now need to mix them all together. So they actually work all together. So to mix the shaders together, we can search for a mix shader. So we'll drop this here. And so we can first mix the metal and the paint together. So the principal shader here can go into this shader, and then the paint can go into that shader. And I'll Ctrl Shift and select this to preview it. So now you can see it's mixing them both together. And we have this factor here, which is going to blend between only using the paint at one or only using the metal at zero. But instead of dragging between them, I want these spots right in here where the chunky bits are, I want that to be the metal, but then the rest of it is going to be the paint. So to do that, we can take this darken result here, and we can put that into the factor. And that's telling it that this part is going to be the metal and this part here is going to be the paint. So now we have the materials mixed together, and some parts the paint and some part is the metal. But then we also need to mix in the rust. So I'm going to duplicate the mix shader, drop it here, and we can put the shader into the shader. And then we can also take this principled shader from the rust, and we're going to put that into the bottom one. And let's Ctrl Shift and select this to preview it. Now again, the factor is blending between them, but I only want the rust to show up right there on the corners of where the paint is kind of being worn away. So to do that, we need to create a mask. Now if I Ctrl Shift and select this paint mask one here, you can see this could be used into the factor to tell it where it's going to be. Now if we just took this color up here and we put the color into the factor, we can Ctrl Shift and select it, you can see there is a problem here. And the problem is that the rust is showing up and it's over the metal, because this is the same paint mask of where the metal is going to be. So instead, we could use the hue saturation value. So let's put the hue saturation value color, and let's put that into the factor instead. So it's not contrasty by using the color ramp, but it's still going to be the same texture. So I can Ctrl Shift and select the mix shader to preview it. So that looks a bit better. You can see there is rust here and there, but I want the rust to be really strong, like right there on the edges. So to do this, we can search for a color ramp. So we're going to put the color ramp between the hue saturation value and the mix shader. So drop it here. And then I want to drag the black tab over and drag the white tab over. And you can now see we're starting to get the effect that we want. So you can see now the rust is kind of bleeding out of that area where the metal is. Let's also hold down the Ctrl key and click here to add another tab. And I want to drag this tab over to the other side. And this way, by dragging this tab over to the other side, we can still see the metal, but then we can also see the rust. So you can see there's kind of like a line here. And this line is being created because this color ramp is white, then it turns black, and then it turns white again. So if I drag this black tab around, you can see the black tab is controlling where that line is. So I'm just going to drag this black tab over a little bit, just so it's at the very end, just like that. And then this white tab, I can drag even closer. So there's just a little bit of bleeding there. So the rust is kind of going out on the metal. So right about there. And then this white tab, I could actually drag it back a little bit so that the rust is kind of coming out a little bit. So now you can see that the rust is mainly just there on the edges. And also the rust is a little bit strong. So if I take the black tab here, I can make the black tab whiter. And as I make it lighter and lighter, you can see the rust is going away. So I'm going to use a hex value of 6A, 6A, 6A there on that center one there on the gray tab. And then I do want to be able to control this in a custom node group. So what I'm going to do is search for a map range node. And a map range node is similar to a color ramp. So I'll put the map range between the color ramp and the mix shader. And with the map range, we have this from max. And you can see if I turn it down, it's kind of going to get rid of that. It's going to get rid of the rust. Or if I turn it up, there's going to be more rust. So we'll be using that later in the custom node group. And so there we have it. So there is the procedural material. So let's now join together into a custom node group. So I'm going to click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output. And I can press Ctrl G to join together into a node group. And then you can hit the Tab key to go in and out of the node group. And I'll drag the node group over here. And let's drag it out to make it bigger. And then also you can rename this to worn painted metal. And also on the material name, I'll call it worn painted metal. And then I'll hit the Tab key to go into the node group. And if I press the N key to open up the side panel, you can go to the group tab. And you can see that there are different sockets here. So right over here, we have this group input. And we can plug values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. Now the mapping node is plugged up to all the textures. So the mapping node is going to control all the material because it's plugged up to all the textures. So we can put the scale value into the extra socket. But then if I click on the scale value, you can see it's going to be three values instead of one. So let's take the type here. And I'll change it to float. So it is using one value. And then I can turn the default value to one because that's what we want. But you can see the texture is still missing. That's because I need to hit Tab and then turn the scale back to one. And then I can go back into the node. Now the next values that I want to control is the paint wear. So I'm going to drag the group input right here. And if it's inside a frame, you can press Alt P to bring it out of the frame. But what I want to do is put this value here. This is going to control kind of how much paint is wearing away. And then also this one here, that is the second one. So I'll put this value into the extra socket. And then this value here, I'll put that into the extra socket. And then I can double click on this to rename it. And I'll call it paint wear one. And then this one here is going to be paint wear two. Now the next value that I want to control is the amount of rust. So if I drag the group input right up here and zoom over to the map range, we have this from max. And you can see that is going to add more and less of it. So I'll take the from max and put that into the extra socket. And let's just rename this. And I'm just going to call it rust amount because controlling the amount of rust. Then I want to control all the different colors. So we'll drag the node group down here or the group input down here. And I can put the base color here into the extra socket. And this one, let's rename this to paint color. And then let's take the group input and we can drag it right up here. And we can take this principle shader, this one is from the metal, we'll put that into the extra socket. And this one I can rename to metal color. And then the same thing for this last one. So we'll drag the group input right up here. And we'll take this base color here from the rust, put that into the extra socket. And this one is going to be rust color. So now I want to control all of the roughness values. So you can see here on the metal, the metal has this value here. And that's going to make it more shiny or less shiny. So we'll put the value into the extra socket. And let's rename this to metal roughness. And then let's control the paint roughness. So if I drag this way back down here, we can take the paint roughness and put that into the extra socket and this one will be renamed to paint roughness and then also want to control the rust roughness. So if I drag this way back up here, let's take the principle shader roughness and put that into the extra socket. And this one we can rename to rust roughness, and then I want to control the bump strengths. So let's first take the rust bump strength here. So this one here, we'll put that into the extra socket and this one I'll rename to rust bump strength. So rust bump strength, then we can also control the metal bump strength. So that's going to be this one here. So the strength can go to the extra socket and this one I can call metal bump strength. And then the last one here, the last one is going to be this bump and this bump and this bump. Now, all of the bumps here, they are all being controlled by this darken and they also all have the same strength value of 0.3. So I'm going to put them all into the same exact socket so we can control them all at once. So I'll put the strength into this extra socket, then this bump strength, put that into the same exact socket. So not a new one, the same socket. And this last one here, the strength into the extra socket. And then this one, I'm going to be calling it worn bump strength, but you can call it whatever makes sense for you. So worn bump strength. All right, let me put the group input right back here. I'll hit the N key to close the side panel and I'll hit the tab key to go outside the node group. And so here's the finished material. So let's just review the finished material. So we have the overall scale of the material. Then we also have the paint wear, so I can make it kind of worn away or more paint and then the paint wear too. And this is like some little speckle detail. And then we also have the amount of rust. So this is pretty cool. You can have just a little bit of rust or lots of rust. And then we also have the paint color, and we also have the metal color, and then we also have that rust color. Then we have the metal roughness, and the paint roughness, and then also the rust roughness. And then we also have the rust bump strength. We also have the metal bump strength, and then the last one, the worn bump strength. So that'll be it for this video. So I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and thank you for watching.

So we create a procedural material, and then we do some texture painting to texture paint where we want the rust to show up on the model. And then we render out the scene to get the finished fire hydrant prop model. If you'd like to check out the course, I'll have the product pages linked in the description. So I hope you enjoyed the tutorial, and thank you for watching."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQrRzyMyT-U,Procedural Woven Fabric Material (Blender Tutorial),"This Blender tutorial guides viewers through the creation of a procedural weaved fabric material. The instructor demonstrates how to achieve a realistic fabric weave texture using UV coordinates, custom node groups, and various adjustable parameters like scale, weave colors, roughness, and bump strength. The tutorial also includes steps for setting up a 3D scene with a cloth draped over a sphere to preview the material, along with lighting and rendering tips. Additionally, the instructor promotes their Gumroad store and Patreon page where the procedural material and other material packs can be purchased to support the channel.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural weaved fabric material. And so if I zoom really close up to this material, you can see this material actually has a fabric weave texture. And right up here on the screen, I'll throw up the base texture that we're going to be creating for those fabric weaves. And so you can see if I zoom out here, it looks really nice on a fabric object. And after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group, so you can control the look of the material. Now, I have this texture coordinate outside of the node group because I'm using the UVs. Because if you use the object coordinates, you can see that it doesn't really look that good. Materials that have a consistent pattern, like maybe brick or fabric or something, they don't always work so well with the object coordinates. So I'm going to use the UV coordinates instead. And that way, because this plane here was UV unwrapped, you can see the fabric is going to curve along with the fabric folds. So the node group has these different values that we can control. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the material. Then we have the two different weave colors. So we have weave color one, and then we also have weave color two. So for example, I could maybe make this like a red color. And then for the second one, maybe make this like a yellowy color or something. So you can really get a different look of the fabric. Then we also have this roughness here. So I have it all the way up to one just because I don't really want it to be super reflective. You could turn it down if you want to, but it doesn't really look like fabric if it's super reflective. Then we also have the sheen weight. And so this is going to help to make it look more like fabric. And then we also have the sheen roughness. And then we also have this sheen tint here. And then we have two bump strengths. So we have the weave bump strength, and then we also have the noise bump strength. This is just some overall noise over the entire material. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material and help support the channel, you can get this material on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. The links are in the description. And if you'd like to purchase all of my materials, then definitely check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my materials pre-set up in Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. So once you've set up my Ultimate Material Pack as an asset library in the Blender, you can just drag and drop the materials from the asset browser into your 3D scenes to add materials to your objects. You can also purchase my Procedural Material Packs, which are packs of 10 materials. And you can purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create more procedural materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I want to create a cloth, which is going to be draped over a sphere, just to preview the material. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll add a sphere. And then I'll go to the Add menu and add a plane. And I'll bring the plane up. I'll hit Tab to go to Edit Mode. And I'll scale the plane bigger like that. And then I'll use the Object Context menu and hit Subdivide. And just continue to subdivide it again and again until it's pretty detailed. Then I'll go back to Object Mode, and I need to add the cloth physics. And I do have a cloth physics for beginners tutorial. If you want to watch that, I'll have a link in the description. But let's just go right over here to the physics. And with the plane selected, I'll add cloth. And then click on the sphere, and I'll add collision. And then if I click back over to the cloth, let's scroll down here. And I'm going to go all the way down, scroll down here, and I'm going to checkmark the self collision. And that'll make it look more realistic. And then because I do video editing in Blender, if I go right here to the playback, usually I have this sync setting right here set to sync to audio because that's better for video editing. But when I'm doing a simulation, it's better if I turn the sync here to play every frame. So just make sure the sync setting is set to play every frame. So now here on the timeline, I'll make sure I'm at the starting frame. And I'll hit the spacebar to play, and that's going to simulate it. And if it's really laggy here in the viewport, then you could instead bake the simulation instead, but I'll just let it play out like this. So I'm just going to continue to let this play until the cloth isn't really moving anymore. So I'll hit the spacebar to pause the animation. That is pretty good. So now I can go back over here to the modifiers, click on the dropdown, and apply the cloth modifier. And then I can select the sphere, and I can just delete it because we don't need it, or you can leave it there underneath the cloth if you want to. And then I'll select the cloth here, and I'll shade it smooth. I'm also going to press Ctrl-1 to add a subdivision surface with one level so you can see it's more detailed. And then also I want to give it some thickness, so I'll click on Add Modifier, and I'll search for the Solidify modifier, and I'll click and drag and drop the solidify before the subsurf. And then you can also change the thickness of the cloth here if you want to. And this cloth is already UV unwrapped. If I just open up a new workspace here and just go to UV editing, you can see because we just added this from an original plane, you can see it's UV unwrapped, and that's a great UV unwrap. It's all opened up and flat. So that will be great for our object. So I'll go back here to this layout. But then I want to scale the objects down closer to the real-life scale in Blender. So I'm going to scale this object down by like a 0.4, press Ctrl-A and apply the scale. So this object is still a little bit big, but that is better to the real-life scale in Blender because it's a bit smaller. And I'll bring this object down right there. And then also when we pressed Ctrl-A and applied the scale, you can see the solidify is now thicker. So back over here on the solidify settings on the modifier properties, we can just turn that thickness down so it's more thin. So then I also added a camera here, and I just pointed the camera right at the object. And if you click here to go to the object data properties of the camera with the camera selected, I turned the focal length up to 90 just to kind of zoom it in a bit and make it look a bit more flat. You can also rotate this object here along the Z axis to get it to a point that you like. And then also if you go here to the output properties, I set the resolution X and Y to the same value so it is a square image. And then I'll go into the rendered viewport mode and I'll show you the lighting. So for the lighting, I added these three different area lights right here. So this first area light right here is set to 200, and I'm kind of using this as like a rim light on the back. And then also this here, this is kind of like another rim light on the back. And this other light here is set to 100. And then the last light here is also set to a power of 100. And this is just kind of shining down on the side to add some nice bright lighting to the object. And then also to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections, if I go here to the world properties, I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDRI from polyhaven.com. Link will be in the description. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So you can click on the yellow dot here next to color, you can choose environment texture, and then click on the open button and open up the downloaded HDRI. Now let's also go here to the render properties and I can open up the film tab here. And I'm going to check mark this transparent button so that the background is transparent. So it'll still light the scene, but you can't see in the background. I'm also going to open up the color management here on the very bottom and I'll use the view transform of filmic and I'll set the look to very high contrast. So I'm now going to click right over here to go to the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here. I'll go into the rendered viewport mode and then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll select the object. Let's click on new to add a new material. And I can just call this weaved fabric. And then I'll also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in the video. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences, and then you can go to the add-ons tab and you can go here to the search and you can search for Node and then you can just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So the first thing that we want to do is go to the add menu and we're going to search for a wave texture. We're going to add a wave texture to create the first set of lines, which are eventually going to become the weaves of fabric. So let's hold down the control and shift key and select the wave texture. And then with the wave texture selected, I'm going to press control T. That's using the feature of the Node Wrangler add-on and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now, as I mentioned, I want the fabric weaves to go along with the curve or the folds of the fabric. So if I use just like the object coordinates, that's really not going to work so well. So I'm going to use the UV coordinates instead. So I'll put the UV into the vector. And then you can see now that the waves are moving along with the folds of the fabric. So I'll select these nodes and just kind of move them back here and those are going to be the mapping nodes. So now let's change the wave texture settings. So on this X here, I'm going to change it to Y instead, so it's going in the opposite direction. And then I'll turn this scale here to 60. So now what I want to do is select this mapping node and I'm going to duplicate the mapping node with shift D and just drop it right here. And we'll use this mapping node later to slightly move around where the weaves are, where the fabric weaves are. I'm now going to select this wave texture and I'll press control shift D to duplicate the node, but keep the wire plugged up and I'll drop it here. Let's control shift and select it to preview it. And then on this one, I want to change the Y back to X instead. So now we have two different waves going in opposite directions. So we're going to use this to create the fabric weaves. So I'm now going to join them together. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a math node. We'll drop the math node right here. And on the math type here, I'm going to set the type to multiply. So under functions, choose multiply. Now we can put the color into the top one and then the wave texture color that can go into the bottom one. And I can control shift and select the multiply to preview it. So now if I zoom in here, you can see we have this nice pattern. Now what I want to do is I want to make this wave texture be a bit more thin, so it looks like weaves of fabric. So I'll duplicate this multiply and drop it here. And on the multiply type here, under functions, I'm going to change this to add. So now you can see if I drag this value here, I actually want to take the color and I want to put that into the bottom value. Now, if I drag this value here, you can see it's going to make it more thin or less thin. Because if I control shift and select the add to preview it, you can see if I drag this value around, it's going to make it lighter and darker. And that is because white equals one and black equals zero. So we can drag the value around to make more values or less values. So specifically the value that I'm going to use is a negative 0.65. So a negative 0.65. So you can see it's really thin, but this one is more thick. So if I put this into the multiply, you can see now it's just showing up in these small little areas. So it's starting to look like one small bit of the fabric weave. So I'll drag these out of the way here and let's box select all these nodes. I'll press control J. Control J is going to join it together into a frame just to keep the nodes nicely organized. And I'll select the frame and press F2 to give it a label. And I'll just rename this to weaves one. So I now want to make another group of weaves. So I'm going to click and drag and box select all these and I'll press control shift D to duplicate the nodes, but keep the wires plugged up. And if I select the frame and press F2 to change the label, I can call it to weaves two. So let's control shift and select this one to preview it. And you can see right now it looks the same, but I'm now going to go right back up here to the top one. And on this top one, if I control shift and select it to preview it, this top one, I'm going to rotate it and I'm going to rotate it on the Z axis. And I'm going to type in 90 here on the mapping Z. So rotate that over. So now you can see if I select this one here, you can see this one is horizontal and this one is vertical. So I now want to join them both together. So I'll go to the add menu and to mix the two colors together, I can search for a mix color. So we'll drop this here. And then on the mix type, I'm going to change it to lighten because we just want to add the light values because the weaves are the light values. So I can plug this value into the color A and I can plug this math node here into color B. And I can control shift and select it to preview it. And if I zoom in here, now you can kind of see both of them on top of each other, but it doesn't look that good. Let's take the factor and turn that all the way up to one. So it's adding both of them. And now you can see it's kind of showing these little X shapes, but what I want to do is move one of the weaves over so that they're not overlapping each other. So let's go right up here to the weaves one and we can take this mapping location X value and I can move this around and I can stick it here. So it's right in between both of them. And I'm going to hold down the shift key as I drag the value to make it more sensitive. So now I can just move this around and I want to stick it right here. So it's right in between. And specifically, I'm going to go with a value of 0.055, 0.055 there on the location X. So now you can see it's right there in the center. So it's starting to look like the fabric weave. However, you can see there's some big open areas. So what I want to do is duplicate all these weaves. We'll offset them a little bit and then we'll join them all together. So there's going to be four different groups of weaves. So I'll box select all these nodes here. So the lighten and the two weaves and I'll press control shift D to duplicate the nodes, but keep the wires plugged up. We can also select the mapping here. We can drag this down here, kind of in the center and let's control shift and select this lighten. You can see it's the same thing. So I want to mix them both together. So I'll select one of the lightens and I'll duplicate it and drop it here. We can take this lighten result. We can put that into color A and then this lighten result, we're going to put that one into color B. So I can control shift and select the lighten to preview. And you can see because they're on top of each other, it's not really doing anything. So if we go to weaves one, we're going to leave this one how it is because we just moved that over. Then if we go to weaves two, this one will completely leave where it is because it's fine where it is. Now, if we go down here to the other weaves, let's select this, press F2. We can call this weaves three and then select this one, press F2, call this weaves four. So for weaves three and weaves four, I'm going to move these just a little bit. So I'm going to take this location X and turn it to zero, but then this one here, I'm going to turn this up on the location Y and that's going to move it down. And I'm going to use the same exact value. So the value is 0.055, so 0.055, and that way it's going to be in the very center. So you can see by moving that on the Y axis, it's in the very center. Now we just need to take one more, which is on top, and we need to move it and stick it right in here to finish the weave pattern, because you can still see there's an empty space there. So if I go down here to weaves four, I want to take the X and Y, I want to click and then drag down and let go so I can change them both at the same time. You can see what this is doing by changing the X and the Y is it's moving it slightly over. So it's moving it down and over. And I'm going to change these to the same value. So again, change it to a 0.055 on both of them, and that's going to stick it right in there. So now you can see we have this really cool weave pattern and it looks like there's these fabric weaves going in and out. So that's going to be the base texture for the weaves. So let's now put these into the bump. So what I can do is take the principled shader and the material output and drag it down here. And I can take the latent result and I can put that into the normal to give it some bump. And let's control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now you can see there's some really weird shading issues and that's because I need to convert the color data into normal data that the shader can use. So I'll go to the add menu and I'll search for the bump node and we'll drop the bump node between the light and in the principled shader and the latent result can go into the height value to convert it to bump data. So if I zoom in here, you can see it's nice and bumpy, but I'm going to turn this to a much smaller strength value of like 0.4 so it's more subtle. Now I also want to add a bit of subtle noise all over the fabric just to make it look a little bit more fuzzy and soft. So I'll go to the add menu and I'll search for a noise texture, drop this right down here. And then I can take the same mapping. We can put the vector here into the vector, the noise texture, and then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And I'll change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to like 150 so it's pretty big and I'll turn the detail to 15 and I can turn the roughness up to like a 0.7 so it's even more detailed. So now we're going to duplicate this bump and we're going to stick it here after this one. So the normal can go into the normal, but we now have this extra height value that we can plug data into. So we'll take the factor and put that into the height value. And then I can control shift and select the principle shader. So now you can see there's this bump strength, which is just some noise. And then this bump strength, which is the fabric weave. So I'm going to box select all these nodes and hit control J to add a frame just to keep it nicely organized because the material is getting a little bit large so that we can remember what everything does. And I'll select the frame and press F2 to give it a label. And I can just call it bump. Now I want the pattern of the fabric to be a little bit more random. So if I go back over here, back to the texture coordinate and mapping, I'm going to add a noise texture here to distort the other waves. So what I'm going to do is hold down the shift key and I'm going to right click and drag with the shift key held and I'm going to draw a line over all these and then let go. And that is going to reroute them through this reroute here. So it's really just doing the same thing as the one before it, but that way we can stick a node in here. So let's drag these back here and I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a noise texture, drop this here. You can see it's distorting that texture that we gave it, but let's just change the settings and then we're going to make it less strong. So it's not distorting as much. So I'm going to turn the scale here on the noise to like 120. And then the detail here, I'll turn it all the way up to 15. So now I can search for a mix color. We'll drop the mix color here. And what we can do is we can use the mix color to mix between the mapping, which isn't distorted and the noise texture is distorted. So we're going to put the color into color B of the noise and then the original mapping, which isn't distorted, we're going to put that into color A. And then on the mix type here, let's change this to the linear light instead. So now I can drag the factor around and it's going to be more distorted or less distorted. And just to preview this better, let's control shift and select the lighten so we can see what it's doing. So you can see it's really distorted right now, but if I drag the factor way down, it's going to be less and less distorted. And I want to make it a very, very, very small number. So there's just a tiny bit of distortion. So the value that I'm going to use is a 0.002, just a 0.002. So now you can see there's just a little bit of noise and it looks a little bit more random. So that's just going to make it look a bit more natural. And then also we can box select these nodes, press control J to join them into a frame, and I can press F2 to add a label, and I can just call this mapping. But this texture coordinate we're going to leave out here because we're not going to be joining this in the final node group. Now we still haven't made the base color yet. So right up here, we're going to create a node group, which is going to be the base colors. Now, what I want to do is make the ones which are going vertical be one color, and then the ones which are horizontal to be another color. So to do this, we're going to take the light in here and we'll duplicate it and drop it here. And then what we want to do is just mix the vertical ones together, and then we'll have another one, which is just going to mix the horizontal ones. So if I control shift and select this, you can see that's vertical. So we'll put this one into the color A. If I control shift and select this one, that one's horizontal. If I control shift and select this one, that's the other vertical one, so that's weaves three. So we'll put this one in the extra socket. Then I'll select the lighten and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here. And then we can take the other ones, which is this one that is horizontal. So we'll put that into the extra socket. And then we can also take weaves two, that's the other horizontal one. We can put that one into color A. So now if I control shift and select this to preview it, you can see we just have the horizontal ones here and we just have the vertical ones there. So now I want to duplicate the lighten again. And on this lighten here, I'm going to just change this back to mix and I'll drop this here. And then I'll duplicate it and drop this one down here. And we're going to put the lighten result for this one into the factor. And then this lighten result is going to go into the factor. And why we're doing this is because the black and white datas of these lightens here, these textures, they can go into the factor. And that's going to determine what part is going to be color A and what part is going to be color B. So now we can make all the different custom colors. So for color A on both of these, we're just going to turn them to fully black for both of them. But now here on the bottom ones, color B, we can make the horizontal weaves color. And then this one here, this is going to be the vertical weaves color. So for color B, I'm just going to make this kind of like a light blue. And then for the bottom mix color B, this one is going to be a bit more of a dark blue. And if you want to use the exact same hex values that I'm using to use the same exact colors, the top one here, the light blue color B, that is going to be a hex value of 93B7FF. And then the bottom one, this one color B, this is going to be a hex value of 4E91FF. So now I want to mix them together again, because we're mixing this together to make the final base color. So I'll select the light in here and I'll duplicate it and drop it here. And we're using a light tint because we just want to add the light values, but we don't want to add the black values. So we can put the result into color A, and then this mixed result can go into color B. And I can Control Shift and select this to preview it. And you can now see that all the vertical ones are light, and then all the horizontal ones are the dark blue. So now this light tint result can go into the base color, and I can Control Shift and select the shader to preview it. We can maybe drag this back here. And then also if we box select all these nodes here, I can press Control J to add a frame. And I'll select the frame and press F2 to give it a label. And I'm just going to call this like base color. So now this is definitely starting to look more like fabric, but it's like really shiny right now. So we want to take this roughness and we're going to turn it all the way up to one. And then we can also open up the sheen here and we'll turn the sheen weight all the way up to one. And then the sheen roughness, I'll turn down to just like a 0.3, and that can help to make it look a bit more like fabric. So you can see by turning up the sheen here, there's kind of like some little light areas along the ends there of the fabric, where you're looking at it sideways, it's going to be a little bit lighter. But we can now take the tint here. We can also make this whatever tint color we want. So because this material is a blue color, I'm also going to make the tint kind of like a light blue. And the hex value for the sheen tint is going to be a hex value of 7495df. And I can zoom out here, and that is it for the finished procedural material. So there's the finished material. So I'm now going to show you how to join together into a custom node group, so you can control the values and have more customization. So I'm going to click and drag the box, select all the nodes, but I don't want to select the texture coordinate. And I also don't want to select the material output, but all the other nodes in between. And I'll press control G to join together into a node group. I'll hit the tab key to go out of the node group, and I can select the texture coordinate, drag it here, and then select both of them and drag them over here because they were really big, but now they're much smaller because we've compressed them. We can also make this a bit bigger so you can just see that a bit better. And then also if you click here to copy the name, I'll press control C to copy and then paste it here into the node group so it's called weaved fabric. So I'll hit the tab key to go into the node group and I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel. And if I go here to the group sockets here on the group tab, I can double click on this to rename it and I'll just rename that to shader. So now if I go right over here to this side, we have this group input and we can plug all the values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So I first want to take the scale and plug the scale into the extra socket. And then if I click on the scale, I want it to be one value instead of three. So I'll change the vector type to float instead. So it's one value. And then the default value, I can turn that back to one. And then if I hit tab to go out of the node group, we'll turn the scale back to one. So now you can see that's going to change the overall size of the material. So let's go back into the node group. Now I want to add the weave colors. So we're going to drag the group input way up here, drag it right over here to the base colors. And we can take color B, put that into the extra socket and then color B here, put that into the extra socket. And just so you know, if you wanted to, you could duplicate the group inputs and drop it here. And then you could just plug up the different custom colors if you want to. And you could just continue to duplicate the group inputs and then plug them up. But I instead just like to move this around here. I just like that because that way I'm using less nodes. But if you don't like all the nodes and the wires like overlapping, you could always just duplicate the group inputs. So I'm just going to plug up both of those custom colors there. And then I'll double click on this to rename it. And I'll just rename this to weave color one. And this one here, I'll rename to weave color two. Then I want to add the roughness. So I'll drag this right down here next to the principal shader. And I can take the roughness value, put that into the extra socket. And then let's also take the sheen weight, put that into the extra socket. We can put the sheen roughness into the extra socket and the sheen tint, put that into the extra socket. And then I also want to add the bump strengths. So let's just drag the node group back here, back behind the bumps. And I can take this first bump here, this one, if I zoom in here really closely, you can see this one here is just controlling the weaves. So I'll put the strength in the extra socket. And if I click on this to rename it, we'll rename it to weave bump strength. And then this other one here is the noise bump strength. So I'll put the strength in the extra socket. And this one I'll rename to noise bump strength. And then I need to select the group input and press Alt P to bring it out of that frame. And we'll drag it right over here to the end. And I can hit the N key to close the side panel. And I can hit the tab key to go outside of the node group. And we now have this nice custom node group to change all the values. So we'll just review the material. So we have the overall scale. Then we also have the different colors. So I think blue looks pretty nice as like a base color, but you could of course go with a red or brown or maybe just like a gray color, whatever colors you want. And then we also have the roughness here. I like keeping it at one because it's fabric. So it's not really that reflective. Then we also have the sheen weight, the sheen roughness, and then we also have the sheen color. And then we also have the weave bump strength and then also the noise bump strength.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EE5W6f3tc4,Procedural Strawberry Material 🍓 (Blender Tutorial),"In this Splendor tutorial, the instructor guides viewers through creating a procedural strawberry material using UV maps, emphasizing the customization of various elements such as scale, seed size, berry color, subsurface scattering, seed color, roughness, and bump strength. The tutorial details the process of combining nodes into a custom node group, allowing for easy adjustments and application. Additionally, the instructor offers the procedural material for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon, and provides information on other available material packs and tutorials.","In this Splendor tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural strawberry material. And after we create the procedural material, I'll be showing you how to join it together into this custom node group. Now, I have this texture coordinate outside of the node group because I'm using the UV maps. Because for this material, the object coordinates doesn't work that well. It kind of stretches the texture in some areas. So for this procedural material, I'm using the UVs of the object. So you'll need to UV unwrap your object to place it on the model. But this procedural material will come with different customizable values. So we have the overall scale. You can use this to change the size of the material. Then we just have the seed size. So you can make the seeds bigger or you can make them smaller. Then we have the berry color. So you can have it less ripe. Maybe make it more of like a green one or just a little bit more orange. Or you can have it really ripe and maybe even make it like a really dark red. Then we have the subsurface here. So this is going to make it look more like food. Because it's allowing light to go through the mesh. And then we also have the seeds color. Then we have the roughness of the strawberry material. And then we have the bump strength. So this first bump strength is just going to be that bump where the seeds are. Then the second bump strength is the seeds bump strength. So you can pop out the seeds. And then we have this noise scale, which is just a little bit of subtle noise over the entire material. And then also that noise bump strength. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this procedural material, you can get this material on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. The links are in the description. You can also check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my materials pre-set up for Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. And if you're wanting to purchase some food materials to use in your projects, then I have some different procedural food packs, which are packs of 10 different procedural food materials. Links to those will be in the description. And to learn how to create more procedural materials, you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the Blender file the same way that I have. So I went to the Add menu, and I just wanted to add this on a sphere, so I added an icosphere. And right behind me, if you go to the Add Icosphere Settings, I turned the subdivisions up to 6. And then I shaded it smooth, so we have a nice, round, smooth sphere. Then I scaled it down by a 0.16. Just a 0.16, hit Enter, press Ctrl-A, and then just apply the scale. And this object is already UV unwrapped, so I'll just leave the default UV unwrapping. Then I'll move this over to the side, and I'm going to add the strawberry object. So for this, I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll add a cylinder. And right behind me on the Add Cylinder Settings, I'll turn the vertices to 16. I'll go to Front View, and I'll scale this down by a 0.1, press Ctrl-A, and just apply the scale. And then I'll move this over to the side, and if I go into Edit Mode, I can start to model this, so I'll add a loop cut right here, drag it up, and kind of scale the loop cut up a bit. Go into Wireframe, and just box-slip the top here, maybe bring it down a bit. And then I can extrude it and scale it, and extrude it and scale it down again. Let's go back to Solid View, and I can bring this down on the Z-axis and scale it up a little bit, maybe select this loop here and scale that up a bit. All right, let's go to Wireframe, and we can just box-slip the bottom here. We'll go to Front View, and I'll just bring this up, and then I can scale it, and then I can extrude it and scale it down. Let's maybe select this entire thing and scale it down and bring it up a little bit. Box-slip this part here, extrude it again, and scale it down, just like that. So we have a basic strawberry shape. Let's go back to Object Mode. We're going to use the Object Context pane to shade this smooth. And then I'll press Ctrl-2 to add a subdivision surface with two levels. Now let's go into Edit Mode, and I'm going to go into Wireframe, and I'm going to hold down the Alt key and select that loop there. Go back to Solid View. Let's navigate down here, hold down the Shift and Alt key and select that loop there. And then I'm going to hold down the Shift and Alt key and select that loop at the very back of the berry. So you can see we have a top loop, then one there, and then the bottom loop. So I'll now press U, and I'm going to mark seam. Then I'll select everything, and I'll hit U, and then I'll click on Unwrap. So we've now unwrapped the object. So now I can kind of bring this over here, maybe rotate this berry a bit. And then I can also add a camera. So you can just go to the Add menu and just add a camera, and then just point the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera and then click here to go to the object data properties of the camera, I turn the focal length up to 100, just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit, so things look a bit more flat and it's a bit more zoomed in. Now as for the lighting, I added a few different area lights. So I added this first area light right here. And for this one, I set the power to about 4. Then I also added this other area light, and this one is 57. And then this area light right down here, and this is a strength of 2, just to give some nice lighting to the objects. And also if you click over here to the world properties, I added in this Rural Crossroads HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. I'll have a link in the description if you want to download the same HDRI. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version from Polyhaven. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to color. You can choose environment texture, and then just click on the open button and open up the downloaded HDRI. And then I turn the strength here down to 0.4, so it's not quite as strong. Let's go over a few more settings now. So if I go up here to the render properties, I'm going to open up the film tab and just checkmark the transparent button, so the background is transparent. And then also here on the color management, I'm going to be using the view transform of filmic, and I'll set the look to very high contrast. So I'm going to click here to go to the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'll go into the rendered viewport mode. And then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll just select one of the objects. Let's click on new to add a new material. And I'll just rename this to strawberry. And then I can also click here and drag and drop that material onto this object, so they both have the same material. And then I'll also be using the node wrangler add-on in the video. So if you don't have that enabled, you can click on edit. You can go to the preferences. And then here on the add-ons tab, just search for node, and you can enable the node wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to create the dots, we're first going to go to the add menu and search for a wave texture. Let's drop it here. And I will control shift and select the wave texture to preview it. And then with the wave texture selected, I'll press control T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now I want to use the UVs, so we're going to plug the UV up to the mapping. So then these are going to be the mapping nodes, so I'll just drag them down here. So now in the wave texture, we can change some of the settings. So the only setting that I actually want to change is the X here. I'm going to change the X to Y instead, so it's going up and down. And then also this mapping here, I'm going to duplicate this, so hit shift D to duplicate and drop it up here, because we're going to be using this mapping later to slightly move the wave texture around. Now you might be wondering how these lines here are going to turn into those kind of long dots, kind of those ovals, which is going to make the seeds. Well, what we're going to do is add another wave texture, which is going to be going in the opposite direction, and we're going to make it so that where the lines are overlapping, it's going to be dark. So there's going to be these little pockets or little holes where there's going to be those circles, and that's going to be used to make that kind of oval shape for the seed. So what I'm going to do is select this wave texture and press control shift D. Control shift D will duplicate the nodes, but keep the wires plugged up. So let's control shift and select this one. And on this one, I want to change it to X on the band's direction. So we have a Y one and an X one. Now what I want to do is join them together. So we're going to search for a mix color node, drop this here, and this color is going to go into color B, and then this color here is going to go into color A. And I'll control shift and select the mix to preview it. So you can already see we're starting to get those circular shapes. And here on the mix type, I'm going to change this to multiply instead, so it's multiplying those values. And then this factor here, let's turn this all the way up to one, and now you can see there's that black with those little white circles. Now I want to change the size of this wave texture. So what we're going to do is search for a math node, and we're going to put it here between the wave texture and the multiply. And I'm going to put it into the bottom value. And then on the add type here, we're going to change it to subtract. Now if I control shift and select the subtract to preview it, if I drag this value, you can see it's making it more thick or less thick because we are subtracting the value, so we're making it smaller, so the white values are turning more dark. Because black equals zero, and then white equals one. Now here on the subtract value, I'm going to turn this to a .57. So now if I control shift and select the multiply, you can see these are a bit longer now. You can see if I drag this down, there's going to be kind of those longer seeds. Or if I turn it up here, they're going to be a bit thicker. But I want the seeds to be more of an oval shape, I don't want them to be circular. I want them to be a bit more of an oval shape, so that's why I'm dragging that down. So now what I'm going to do is click and drag to box select these nodes. I'll press control J, and that's going to join it together into a frame, and the frame is just a nice way to keep the nodes organized. And if I select the frame, I can press F2 to add a label, and I'll just rename this to seeds texture one. So now I want to duplicate this entire thing, and I want to move it down, and then we're going to offset it so that there are more seeds here in between the other rows of seeds. So that way there will be two rows of seeds, and they're going to be offset. So I'll box select all these nodes, and I'll press control shift D to duplicate the nodes, but keep the wires plugged up. Let's kind of drag these back here, and then what I want to do is mix these multiplies together. So if I hold down the shift key and select both of them, I can press control zero. That's going to add this mix color here, and I'll just drag this here into the center. And then here on the type, on the mix type, I want to change this to lighten, because I just want to add the light values. Now this factor here, I want to turn all the way to one, but you can see it doesn't really appear like it's doing anything, and that's because this seed's texture and this seed's texture, they're overlapping each other. So they're on the same exact position. And also if we select the seed's texture here, select the frame, and press F2, I want to change the label to seed's texture 2. So now we can take these mapping nodes, and we can move the location, and you can see that's going to move around where it is. So on the Y value of the seed's texture 2, I want to turn this Y value to a negative 0.03. So a negative 0.03. And you can see that's going to basically move it over by a very small amount, so we're moving it over this way. Then I want to move it up a bit so that it's kind of right here. So we're going to go right up here, and we're actually going to change this mapping node to do that. So for this mapping node, if we change the X value, that'll move it up and down. So I'm going to change this one as well to a negative 0.03. So a negative 0.03, hit Enter, and I can see we've dragged that up there. So now you can see that there are those two different layers or lines of seeds, and they're kind of offset. Now they're way too big, so I want to make them smaller. So if I go to the Add menu, I can search for a color ramp and just drop the color ramp here, and then I can drag the black tab over and then drag the white tab over. And now you can see we have those nice oval-shaped seeds, and that is really starting to look like those seeds on the strawberry. Now there is a problem with this, which you may be wondering about, and that is that the UV map is messed up. So these seeds are kind of like rotated at a weird angle, and they're too large. So what I want to do is change or edit the UV maps. So you can click right up here to go to Blender's UV editing workspace, and so now we have a UV edit over here and then the 3D viewport right over here. So what I'm going to do is press the A key to select all the mesh, and then I can rotate it. Let's rotate that over by 90 degrees, go into the rendered viewport mode so we can actually see what it's doing, move it over, and then we can just scale this up a bit, and we're going to make it maybe about that big, probably just something like that. And then if we select this object here and go into edit mode and press the A key to select everything, I just want to select all the mesh here, all the UVs, and I'll scale these up quite a bit bigger, so maybe something like that. So that's better for the UV editing. And then also this strawberry, I'm going to press Shift-E to duplicate it, double tap the R key and kind of rotate that over there so that we just have kind of another strawberry there. That just kind of looks a little bit nicer for this final scene. Double tap the R key to rotate that. So now we just have two different strawberries. All right, so we can go back over here to the shading workspace. I'll press Ctrl-S to save the file. So that's better for the UV editing. So now I want to make the custom colors. So after this color ramp, I will search for a mix color. We'll drop the mix color here after the color ramp, and the color can go into the factor, so that way the white and black values are determining what part is going to be color A and what part is going to be color B. So for color A, I'm going to make this kind of like a nice reddish color. And then for color B, which is the seeds, this is going to be kind of like a light brownish color. And if you want to use the same hex values I'm using, color A is going to be a hex value of 8C1400, and color B is going to be a hex value of 826B14. So now let's put the mix color result into the base color, and I can Ctrl-Shift and select the shader to preview it. And then also the roughness, let's turn this down to a 0.25, because strawberries are usually pretty shiny. And then also let's open up the subsurface here, and the subsurface is going to add light going through the material, so it'll look more soft and look more like food. So I'll turn the weight all the way up to 1. And then for the radius here, we have the red, green, and blue values. So if I turn each one of them up, it's going to add more red, green, and blue. So on the radius here on the top one, I'll turn this up to 2, and that'll just add a bit more of the red values. Another thing you could do is just like search for an RGB, and you could make this brighter and maybe make it like a red color, and then put the color into the radius. And you can see that's going to change the color of the subsurface. It's a little bit hard to see though with the mixed color right here changing the colors, but I'm just going to leave that radius set to 2. So if I zoom into the seeds here, I want to have a spot which kind of bumps back in, but then where the seeds are, I want that to pop out a bit. So we're going to make that by using the bumps here. So what we're first going to do is take this lighten here. You can see this lighten has black and white, and we're going to put this result here into the normal to give it some bump. And let's Ctrl Shift and select the principled shader. Now you can see it doesn't really look correct, and that's because we need to go to the add menu and search for a bump node and put that here between the lighten and the normal. And then the result here needs to be going into the height value to convert it to bump data. So now you can see it looks a bit bumpy, but it's really weird and it looks really sharp. One thing we can do is turn on the invert here, and that way it'll pop back in instead of popping out, but you can still see it's really sharp here on the edges. So to fix this, I'm going to search for an RGB curves, and let's put the RGB curves between the lighten and the bump. So now what I can do is drag this down here. So add a tab and kind of drag it down. Let me zoom out here so you can see this a bit better. And if I kind of drag this down, you can see it's going to start to smooth it out. And I'm going to click here to add another tab here. So we have two little dots, and I'm going to drag these around until they are nice and smooth. So it might be a little bit hard to get it correct. So I'm actually going to show you the exact number values that I'm using, but just kind of try to drag this around and get it correct so that you can see it looks really smooth. And then there's just some little holes going in there. Now, another thing we can do to make this look better is we can turn this distance value down, and that's going to smooth it out quite a bit. You can see if I turn the distance down, it's really going to smooth it out. So this is distance value on the bump. I'm going to turn this to a 0.05. And now you can see that right there where those edges are, it's really smooth. And then also the strength value, you can change that, but I'm going to leave it at one. So if that's looking good for you, then you can just leave that how it is. But if you're still having trouble getting this correct, like if there's still some really sharp points right there, then I will be giving you the exact number values for where I have these dots placed. So if you click here on the first dot and then go to these number values, you can see there are x values and y values to move it around. So if you want to punch in the same exact values for the x value for this first one, it's going to be a 0.67150, and the y value is going to be a 0.11440. Then on the second one here, if you click on this one here, the x value is going to be 0.87681, and the y value is going to be 0.29514. So you can get that exact if you want to use the same values I'm using, or you can just try to get it really close so that right here it looks pretty smooth between those bumps. And then of course, turning that distance value down will make it quite a bit more smooth. You can also turn the bump strength down if you want to, to make it even more smooth and make it more subtle. But I like how that looks. You can see that's really starting to look like a strawberry now. Now if I zoom really close up to the seeds, you can see the seeds still aren't popping out. So what I'm going to do is click on this result here, and I can drag out, and then I can just let go right here. And then we can search for a color ramp. So we're going to search for a color ramp factor, and just drop that right there, so now it's already plugged up to it. And then what we can do is select this bump, and we'll duplicate it, and we'll just drop it here after the first one. And if you select the bump, you can press the backspace, and that is going to change the bump settings back to its default settings. So now this color ramp here, the color can go into the height value to make it bumpy. So now you can see we're kind of having that same problem, but what I can do is drag the black tab over, and we can make it really, really small. So just drag the black tab over until it's just about around the seed. So I need to make it a little bit bigger, so something like that's pretty good. But if I zoom in closely to the seeds, you can see they're kind of popping out a lot, and they look kind of pointy. So what I'm going to do is take this white tab here, and I'm going to drag it way down and drag it down here so it's really dark, so that it doesn't look quite as pointy. So if I just drag this down like that, now you can see the seeds look much more round. Maybe I'll just bring that down a little bit. So you can punch in the same hex value I'm using, and that's going to be 272727. So you can now see the seeds look much more smooth, but they still look like they're popping out of the mesh. Now the last thing that I want to do is just add a very tiny amount of noise over the surface. So I'll select this bump node, and I'll duplicate it and drop it here. And then we can go to the add menu, and we're going to search for a noise texture. We'll drop the noise texture here. And then we can take this mapping vector here, and we're going to drag this over and plug it into the vector of the noise texture. And then the noise texture factor can go into the height via this bump. And now we can change the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 20, and then I'll just leave the other settings how they are. And then here on the bump strength, to make this very, very subtle, I'll turn it down to like a 0.05, so it's very subtle. So just a tiny little bit of bump over the surface. And that is it for the procedural material. So let's now join it together into a custom node group. Let me just make this smaller so we have a bit more space here. Now what I want to do is actually not put the texture coordinate into the node group. You definitely could if you want to, but because I'll be selling this material and adding it to my ultimate material pack, some people might be confused because they might be adding this onto the model, and then it may not be working correct, and they may not realize that they need to UV unwrap the object. So I'm going to leave the texture coordinate out here, and that way anyone using this material can choose if they want to use the UVs for the object or whatever texture coordinate they want to use. So what I'll do is box select all the nodes, but we're not going to select the texture coordinate, and we're not going to select the material output. And I'll press Ctrl G to join it together into a node group. And I'll hit the Tab key to go out of the node group, and I can now drag all these nodes together, so drag them much closer. Let's drag this over here, and then I can drag this out to make it bigger. And I can copy the material name and just paste it here into the node group. Let's hit the Tab key to go into the node group, and I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel, and I can double click on this BSDF, and just rename that to Shader because I like that better. So now we can take the group input, and we can plug values up to it to control the values outside of the node group. So this scale value here on the mapping, the mapping is plugged up to all the textures, so this scale is going to control the size of the entire material. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket, let's click on the scale, and then you can see it's going to be three values, but I just want it to be one value. So on the type here, we're going to change it from Vector to Float, so it is just one value. So let's hit Tab to go out of the node group, and then we'll take the scale and turn that back to 1. And if I go back into the node group, we also need to turn this default value to 1, so that's the new default value of that group socket. So the next custom value that I want to add is the seed scale. And for the seed scale, I'm going to box select all these nodes here and drag them back a bit. So between the multiply and the light in here, I'm going to search for a hue saturation value and stick this here. Now the hue saturation value has the value, which is going to make it lighter and darker, and so you can see that is changing the sides of each one of those seeds. So the seeds are bigger or smaller. So I'll duplicate the hue saturation value, drop it down here, and now I can take the value from the hue saturation value and put that into the group input, and then we can take this one here and take the value, and I can put that into the same exact socket. So if I go outside of the node group, this value is going to change all the sizes of the seeds all at once. So let's go back into the node group, and if I click on the value here, double click on it to rename it, I'll rename it to seeds size. Now I want to control the berry color, so if I drag the group input way over here, let's take this red color, put that into the extra socket, and I'll double click on this to rename it, and I can just call it berry color, or you can call it strawberry color or base color, whatever you want to call it. Then I also want to take the subsurface, so let's take the subsurface weight here, put that into the extra socket, double click on this to rename it, and I'll just rename it to subsurface because I like that better. And then I want to also control the seeds color, so we'll take color B and put that into the extra socket, and rename this to seeds color. Then I want to control the roughness, so let's just put the roughness into the extra socket. And then let's add the bump strength, so I'll just drag the group input like right down here. We can take the first bump strength, we'll put that into the extra socket, and I'm just going to rename this one bump strength because this is the main bump strength. And then if we look at this one here, this one is just the seeds, so we'll put the strength in the extra socket, and this one I'll rename to seeds bump strength. And then this one here, this is just some noise, but what I first want to do is put this noise scale into the extra socket, just in case they want to change the scale here, so I can double click on this to rename it, and I'll just rename this to noise scale. So that way, just in case I want to change the noise scale, I can. Let's go back into the node group, and then the strength here, we'll put that into the extra socket, and this one I'll rename to noise bump strength. All right, I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. I can drag the node group over here, and I'll hit the tab key to go outside the node group. So we can just review the final material. Let me just make this a bit bigger so we can see all the material. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the material. Then we also have the seed size. You don't want to make them too big though, because it's kind of going to break the material, but you can just make it a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger. And then you can also make the berry color, so you can make it more of like an unripe berry or a little bit ripe, or you can make it really ripe and maybe like make it a dark color that looks really nice. And then we have the subsurface, and then we also have the seeds color. So after looking at reference images, it seems like some strawberries are a bit more of a lighter yellow, maybe if they're less ripe, and then some seeds are a little bit darker, so you can control that there. Then we have the roughness of the material, and then we also have the main bump strength. We also have the seeds bump strength, and then that noise scale, and also the noise bump strength if you just want to add a little bit more noise to the surface. So that's it for this tutorial.

So it's going to be created procedurally, meaning that all the materials in the scene will be created procedurally with Blender shader nodes, so we won't be using any texture maps. And this tutorial will work great in both Cycles and Eevee, so I'm going to be using the Cycles rendering engine in this tutorial, but it works great in Eevee, it looks pretty much the same in Cycles and Eevee. So you can use whichever render engine you want.

Now if you like creating sci-fi artworks in Blender, then you might be interested in checking out my Sci-Fi Construction Robot Blender tutorial series. So that's an 11-part tutorial course, and throughout the series, I show you how to create this sci-fi construction robot. So the course is all step-by-step and in real time, and we go through the complete process of modeling the robot, doing all the textures and the materials, doing the lighting, and we even rig the robot and then do the animation, and render out the animation to get this finished animation here of this construction robot. If you'd like to check out the course trailer video, I'll have the link in the description, and you can check out the product pages linked in the description. So here I am in Blender, and let's start creating the planet. So I'm just going to start by deleting everything, and I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll go to Mesh, and I'm going to add an icosphere, and then before you move the icosphere around right behind me, you can click here on the Add Icosphere Settings, and I'm just going to turn this up to a 6, and that way you can see it's nice and smooth and round. I can close the Add Icosphere Settings, and then I'll use the Object Context menu and shade it smooth. And then I thought maybe I'd scale this object up a bit so it's larger, so I'm just going to scale it up by 4, so just hit S to scale, type 4, and then Enter. So it's a bit bigger. Now before I continue making the planet and the atmosphere, I want to create the background world, so we're just going to add some stars in the background. So I'm going to click here to go to the Shading Workspace, and I'll go into the Rendered Viewport mode. Let's click here on Object, and we're going to edit the world nodes instead. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a voronoi texture. Let's drop this here, and the voronoi distance can go into the color of the background. So now you can see we have all these little dots here. And then for the scale, I'm just going to turn this up to like 120. Now let's add a color ramp to make it more contrasty, so I'll search for a color ramp. We're going to drop the color ramp here, and then I'm going to switch the white tab and switch the black tab so they're opposite. And then the black tab, I'm just going to drag it way over here so it's very small. Now I have the viewport denoising on, so it's kind of hard to see the stars because they're really small. We can adjust this later if we need to, but in the final render, you should be able to see just some really small stars. So that's what I'm going to do for the stars in the background. And also the strength here, I'll turn this up to 2 so that the stars are a little bit brighter. Let's click on world, and we can go back to objects so we can edit the shader nodes. And I'll just go back here to the layout for now. Let's also save the project, so I'll just click on file and save the project to my computer. I'll just save this as planet.blend and then save the file. So we're now going to be making the atmosphere. So before I make the atmosphere, I do want to add a sunlight, because if I go into the render viewport mode, you can see everything's really dark. So I'll go to the add menu, and let's go down here to light, and we're going to add the sunlight. We can just kind of move the sunlight up here and maybe rotate the sunlight back a bit. And then if we go to the sunlight settings, I want to turn the strength to 4. And then I'll also make it just a very, very slight yellowish color. So to make the atmosphere, I'm going to basically be creating a gradient. And then we'll make it so that the gradient moves whenever the light moves. And so that way, you'll only be able to see the atmosphere where the light is. But then when there's no light, you aren't going to be able to see the atmosphere. Now to make the gradient so that it changes when the light changes, we need some sort of object which is going to rotate when the sunlight moves around the object. So I'll press shift C to make sure the 3D cursor is in the center of the scene. And then I'll go to the add menu, let's go to empty, and I'm just going to add a plane axis. And I'll scale this object up a bit so that you can kind of see here, so it's popping out of that sphere. And I'm just using an empty object, because empty objects don't show up in the render, because they don't have any visible faces. So now what I want to do is I want to make it so that when I move the light, the light is always pointed towards the planet. So select the light, and we're going to click right here to go to the object constraint properties. We'll click on add object constraint, we're going to add track 2. And on the target object, we'll click on the eyedropper, and we're going to choose this icosphere. Now when I move the light around, you can see the light is always pointed at the planet. So I can move that around, and that's just a great way to quickly be able to move where the light is to move the light in the shadow. But then this object here, this object is going to determine where the gradient is. And so I always want this object to be pointed towards the sun. So if we select the empty, we'll click on add object constraint, and we'll also choose a track 2. And we'll click on the eyedropper, and we're going to choose the sun. So now if I move the sun around, you can see the empty is also going to move around with the sun's position. So now you can create the atmosphere material. So we're going to select the object here, and let's go to the shading workspace. And we're going to click on new to add a new material. And for this material, I will just call it Atmo for short, I'll just call it Atmo. So to create this material, we're first going to search for an emission, because where the atmosphere is, I want it to kind of glow, and we're going to delete the principled shader. But then I also want to add a transparent shader so that it's transparent, and so it'll just kind of be glowing more on the edges, and then it'll be transparent in the middle. So we'll add a transparent here, and an emission here. Then I want to mix them together, so we're going to add a mix shader, and we can put the transparent one to the top one, and the emission can go into the bottom one. And on the emission strength, I'll turn this up to like a 40. We can also plug the mix shader up to the surface. And then this emission color, I'm going to make this kind of a yellowish-orangey color, and if you want to use the same color I'm using, the hex value that I'll be using is FF9269. Now the factor is going to blend between using fully the emission or fully the transparent, but I want it to be more transparent in the center, and then just be glowing around the edges. So we're going to need to create a mask for this. So we're going to search for the layer weight node, and we'll just add the layer weight right here. If you control shift and select it to preview it, you can turn on the node wrangler add-on, and then hold down the control and shift key, and select the facing by control shift and clicking it twice. You can see it's black here, and then it's white outside. So we're going to use this to make that mask. But I'm going to search for a color ramp to make it more contrasty, so we'll stick it the color ramp here after the layer weight, and on the layer weight here on the blend, I'm going to turn it to 0.1, and that way it's going to make it even smaller. But then we can play around with these values to make it even more subtle. So instead of dragging these around to make it more contrasty, I'm just going to take the white tab here, and I'm going to make the white tab a very, very dark gray so it's very subtle. Because if it's too bright, it's just going to be super strong, and I still want to be able to see through it. It's not supposed to be super bright, it's just going to be a subtle atmosphere. So for this very dark gray, the hex value is going to be 2e, 2e, 2e. So that's going to be the atmosphere, but then I also want to make the atmosphere just be visible where the sunlight is, so we need to create a gradient, and the gradient is going to adapt to where the sun is. So to do this, we're going to search for a texture coordinate node. So we'll drop that right here, and then we can choose an object. So if we click on the object here, we're going to choose the empty object. So we're using the texture coordinate of the empty. Now we're going to search for the separate XYZ node, and we're going to take the object here, and we're going to put that into the vector. So now if I control shift and select the separate XYZ, we have the X value, we have the Y value, and we have the Z value. So those are the texture coordinates. And if we select the light here and move the light around, you can see the empty is going to follow the light. You can see if I move the empty around, the empty is going to move where that gradient is, but because the empty is in the very center and it's moving around by the light, so the light is moving it, you can see that's going to change where that gradient is. So I'm going to control shift and select it until we're previewing the Z one, because you can see the Z one is facing the correct way where the sun is. I now want to add a color ramp, so we can just duplicate this color ramp and drop it here. And I now want to drag this gray value way over here, and I can also click on the color and I can make it fully white. And I'm going to drag it way over here so it's really contrasty. So again, you can see if I select the sunlight and move it around, that is moving the gradient. So now what I want to do is mix this color ramp here in with this color ramp. And what we're going to do is we're going to tell it so that where the black part is, that is where you'll be able to see this atmosphere rim. So to do this, we're going to search for a mixed color, we're going to drop the mixed color here, and we're going to take this color ramp color, and we're going to put that into the factor. So it's basically the mask to tell it that this color ramp here is only going to be visible on this top area. Now this color ramp color can go into color A, and then color B, this can be fully black. So it is a little bit hard to see, but if I deselect this, you can see it's just gray here right on the top. If I take this gray color and make it lighter, you can basically see what it's doing. So this is the mask, so it's telling it that we're only going to be able to see that gradient there on the top, but then of course it's that very dark color, so it's very subtle. So now we can take this mixed result and we can put that into the factor of this mix shader to determine what part is transparent and what part is the emission. So if I control shift and select the mix shader, now you can see that the atmosphere is only up here, but then right down here where there's the shadow, you can't see the atmosphere. And of course if you want to make the atmosphere stronger, you can turn this up, you can see it's brighter, but I want to keep it very, very low down, so it is going to be much more subtle. So that's why I'm using that really dark gray. So now we're going to be creating the planet atmosphere, which is the main procedural material. So I'm going to go back to solid view and I'm going to select the object and I'll press shift to duplicate it, then I'll hit S to scale, and I'm going to scale it down by just a very small amount. So if I hold down the Z button, go into wireframe, if I zoom in here, you can see we just want to scale this planet object down, so it's just slightly smaller. So the atmosphere is just slightly bigger than it. And then with the object selected, the smaller object, we're going to click here to delete the material, and let's click on new to add a new material, and I can rename this to planet. So if I go into the rendered viewport mode, you can see now we have the atmosphere, and then the planet is underneath it. So now we'll create the procedural planet material. So for this material, I'm going to add a noise texture, let's drop it here, and I'll control shift and select it to preview it. And on the noise texture settings, let's change the 3D to 4D instead, and then I'll leave the scale at 5, and then the detail I'll turn to the max of 15, and the roughness I'll turn to a .85. And then also on the FBM here, let's change this type to the rigid multi-fractal instead, so rigid multi-fractal. And then we're also going to go down here to this gain, and if I turn the gain up, it's going to add some really cool details, so I'm going to turn this gain to 115, so it's super detailed. But I want to make it even more detailed, so we're going to select the noise texture and press control T to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I want to use the object coordinate, so we're going to put the object into the vector. And we're going to use another noise texture to distort this noise texture, so I'll press shift to duplicate it, drop it here, and the vector can go into the vector of this noise. So now we can go to the add menu and we can search for a mix color, and we'll drop the mix color here after this mapping, and we want to mix together the mapping which isn't distorted and this noise which is going to distort it. So this mapping vector will go into color A, and then for color B we're going to put the noise texture factor into color B. So now you can see we have this factor here, we can drag this around to make it more distorted or less distorted, but I'm actually going to leave it at a 0.5. So now if we zoom in here you can see we have some really, really cool details, and it looks like a cool planet with maybe like some small rivers or some mountains, and maybe some canyons because it is a desert planet. And then also to make this look a little bit more interesting, we're going to take the mix result and we're also going to put that into the W value, and that makes it look even more interesting because we have some really cool details there. So now I want to create the colors for the planet, so we're going to search for a color ramp and we're going to drop the color ramp here after the noise, and then we can make all the different custom colors. So the first one is just going to be fully black, but let's hold down the control key and click here to add another tab, and then hold down the control key and click here to add another tab, and then this last tab we'll kind of drag over a bit. So the first color is going to be kind of this brown color on this one right here, and the hex value is going to be 544437, so you can punch that in if you want to use the same color I'm using. Then this second one here kind of in the middle is going to be a red color, and the hex value is going to be 990C03. And then the last one is going to be kind of a bright peachy color, and the hex value will be FFCFBE. So now the color ramp can go to the base color, and I'll control shift and select the material to preview it. And then I also want to add a bit of bump, so we're going to take the factor, we're going to put that into the normal, but then we need to search for a bump node, and put the bump node here between the noise texture and the normal, and this bump here, the factor needs to be going into the height value to convert it to bump data, so now you can see the surface looks really bumpy, but I'm going to turn the strength just to like a .1 so it is more subtle. So that's it for the planet texture, but I also want to create one more which is going to be a clouds texture. So I'll go back to solid view, actually I'm going to go into the wireframe, let me make this bigger, and I'm going to zoom in really close. I'll press shift to duplicate, then I'll hit s to scale, and I'll scale it up just by a very small amount, and I want to scale this up so that the clouds is kind of in between the atmosphere and the planet, so just right there. So we're going to have three spheres basically inside each other. So then we'll delete the planet material, let's click on new to add new material, and I can rename this to clouds, and then if we go into the rendered viewport mode, it shouldn't be too small so that you can see the planet, but it shouldn't be too big that it covers the atmosphere. So right in between the atmosphere and the planet surface. So now let's create a procedural clouds material. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'll search for a noise texture, drop it here, and we can press ctrl t with the noise texture selected, that's using the node wrangler addon, and we're going to put the object into the vector so it's using the object coordinates. Now let's ctrl shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And I'm going to change the scale to a 3.6, I can also turn the detail all the way up to 15, and I'll turn the roughness to a 0.65. And this lackinarity here I'll turn to a 2.5 so it has a little bit of lackinarity. Then let's also search for a color ramp to make it more contrasty, drop it here, and I can drag this black tab kind of to about here, I think that's pretty good, and then the white tab I'll bring this over to about there. So now you can see we have a cool clouds texture. Now I also want to make another clouds texture, so we're going to box select all the nodes, and I'll press shift d to duplicate and drop them down here, and let's ctrl shift and select this one to preview it, and for this one I'm going to drag the black tab over kind of to about here, and then I'll drag the white tab over just a little bit, and then we can also change some of the noise settings, so I'm going to turn the roughness all the way up to 1. And this distortion here I'll turn this up to a 0.3 so it has a little bit of distortion. And I think I should do that for the top one here, so this distortion I'll turn to a 0.3 as well so it's a little bit more distorted, so it kind of has that wispy look and the clouds are kind of spinning around and that looks more realistic. So now we have these two cloud textures and I want to join them together, so if you select both color ramps at once you can press ctrl 0, and that is going to add this mix color and it's going to plug them both together. Now I actually want to switch these, so I'm going to put this one into color B, and this one I'm going to put into color A, and then on this mix type here we're going to change this to darken so it just adds the dark values because you can see the clouds are dark but then the rest of it is white. Now I'll turn the factor all the way up to 1 and that's going to add both of the clouds. So we have this one here and this one here and then you can see we're mixing them together. So this principled shader is going to be the clouds, but then where there's not the clouds that needs to be transparent so we can see the planet underneath. So we're going to search for a transparent shader, so search for the transparent BSDF, not the translucent but the transparent, we're going to drop this down here, and then we also want to mix the principled shader and the transparent together, so we can select both of them, and you can press ctrl 0, and that's going to add this mix shader, and let's ctrl shift and select the mix shader to preview it. So we're mixing between the principled shader and the transparent shader. So for the principled shader I'm going to turn the roughness all the way up to 1, this is going to be the cloud material, and then we can also open up the subsurface and I'll turn the subsurface weight to a 0.5, just to make the clouds a little bit more soft. And then on the transparent color just make sure this is fully white so it's fully transparent. So we can now take the darkened result and we can put this into the factor, so you can see now where the clouds are, you can see that it is the principled shader so it's that white color, but then where there's no clouds it's going to be the transparent shader, and so that way you can see the planet surface underneath the clouds. So now if you want to change any of the cloud settings you can, so you could make it really sharp if you want to be able to see the clouds better, or make them more subtle, you could also change the scale of the clouds, or you could also change the roughness or the details or anything that you want, I'm going to leave this how this is, but you can play around with the clouds and make them look different if you want to. So now let's just finish up the scene, so I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a camera, I'm going to hit the 1 on the numpad to go to the front view, and I'll press ctrl alt numpad 0, so ctrl alt numpad 0 is going to bring the camera to where we are. And if you select the camera you can hit G to grab, and you can move the camera around, you can also hit G to grab, and then you can double tap the Z key to bring the camera in and out, and I'll just bring the camera out to about there. Let's also go back here to the layout because we don't need to use the shader nodes anymore so I'll go into the rendered viewport mode, and then you can take this light here and you can move it around, and you can kind of see more of the planet if you want it to be over here, or you can make less of the planet, you can bring it further back, really just do whatever you want. Now let's also change the color management, so if I go here to the render properties and scroll down here, on the color management I'll use the view transform of AGX, and then the look here I'm going to use high contrast, and that'll make the whole scene look nicer. Now we can also open up the sampling here, and on the samples, on the render samples I'm going to use 100 samples, and I'm also going to turn on the denoise, so that it denoises the image when we render it. And then also if you go here to the output properties, if you make the resolution higher it will look a bit nicer, it'll look really large, if you want to make it a really large image you can. So I'm going to make it a 2560 by 1440 image, so this is a 2K image so it's really large, of course this will take longer to render. And then also here on the percentage, I'm going to turn this up to like 200, so that way it's going to be like a large 4K image so it'll be really big and we can see lots of detail, but of course if this will take too long to render, then you can turn it down. And of course if you wanted to you could also use the Eevee rendering engine, this will render fine in Eevee as well, and it actually looks pretty similar in Eevee. Now before we render this I do want to add a glare in the compositor just to make the atmosphere glow to really finish off the image and make it look really nice. So let's click here to go to the compositing workspace, we'll click on use nudes, and I'm going to go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a glare, let's drop this down here. And on the streaks here I'll change this to bloom instead. And then to actually be able to see this showing up, we can click here on the corner and drag out to split the window. Let's click here on the editor type and I will change this to the 3D viewport. Let's go into the rendered viewport mode so we can see it happening. And then if you scroll over here, just scroll with your mouse, you can click on this drop down arrow here and on the compositor we can turn this to always so we can see the compositing in the viewport. And then let's hold down the control and shift key and select the glare to actually preview it so it's going to show up. So now what we need to do is turn this threshold down and if we turn the threshold down the bloom is going to be brighter. So that is way too strong but I found the threshold of like 0.5 looks pretty good. And then also on the medium here I'm going to turn it to high quality. So it's high quality so it'll look a bit nicer. You can also change the size here if you want so you can make it smaller or bigger, I'll just leave it at the default of 8. So make sure you press control S to save the blender file and then you can press F12 to render the image. And there we go, the image is finished and you can see there's the stars in the background and the stars, some of the stars are actually glowing a little bit. So now we can save the final image by just clicking on image and clicking on save as and just saving the image to your computer. Now some of you also might want to do an animation like you saw at the beginning of the video. So I'm not going to be going over the complete animation process but I will just show you how to get started with the animation. So if you go back over here to the layout, what you can do is select the camera and you can move the camera back so hit G to grab, double tap the Z key, kind of move the camera back and then you can add a keyframe here by hitting the K button and just adding a location keyframe. Then you can go to the end of your animation, however you want it to end, you can move the camera forward and then again hit the K button and you can add another location so that the camera is going to move. And then as far as moving the light you can just do the same thing, so you can move the light kind of back here, hit the K button and you can insert location. Then you can go to the very end of your animation, move the light over here, so just move it over wherever you want and then insert another location keyframe. So now you can see as I play the animation you can see the sun is moving. And then if you don't know how to render out all the frames to images and export it into a final video then I have a separate tutorial on my YouTube channel where I show you how to do that. So I'll have a link in the description to that video if you want to check it out and in that video I show you how you can save your output and save it out to a folder and render out all the rendered frames and then I show you how to put them into Blender's video editor and export it out to a finished video. But that'll wrap it up for this tutorial so I hope you enjoyed this and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbBPg2ojdVY,Part 3: Procedural Terrazzo Tile Materials (Blender Tutorial),"In the final part of a three-part tutorial series, the creator demonstrates how to make two additional terrazzo tile materials using Blender. The tutorial covers duplicating objects, adjusting node setups, and creating customizable procedural materials. It also highlights the advantages of using the ""Oven"" Blender add-on for texture baking, allowing materials to be used in game engines or other 3D software. The presenter offers these materials and others for purchase through various platforms and provides links for further learning and resources. The series concludes with a review of the created materials and encouragement to check out related content.","Welcome to part 3 and the final part of this 3 part tutorial series where we're creating these terrazzo tile materials. If you haven't seen the previous parts then definitely check them out, the links will be in the description. So in the first part we created these two materials, and then the second part we created these two, and then in this part we'll be creating two more materials. And if you'd like to purchase these materials to use in your projects, then you can purchase them with the links in the description on my gumroad store and patreon page in the blender market. You can also check out my ultimate blender procedural material pack which comes with all of my materials pre-set up for blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. And every time I create 10 more procedural materials, I update the ultimate material pack with all of the new materials. And you can also check out my blender procedural material tutorial playlist to learn how to create many more materials. Now just one more thing before we start, another common thing you might want to do with procedural materials is texture bake them so that you have a color map and a roughness map and normal map and that way you can use the materials in a game engine or another 3d software and actually have image texture maps. So if you ever want to do texture baking in blender, then I highly recommend checking out this amazing blender add-on for easy fast texture baking. Oven is an amazing blender add-on for speeding up the baking process. Start by UV unwrapping your objects. You can then select the objects that you want to bake. You can then choose what maps to bake, like the color, roughness, normal, metallic, and more maps. Then choose your preferred settings, like where to export the textures, the file name, file type, and texture size. Then hit bake and the add-on will automatically bake all the textures and export them to your computer. Then click the recreate materials button and the add-on will automatically replace the material with a new material using the baked textures. You can find my full add-on review video with the link in the description and by purchasing through my link you'll be helping to support this channel. Alright so this next material that we're going to be creating is very similar to this one, but the node setup is just a little bit different but it is quite similar. So what I'm going to do is select this object and I'll duplicate it and move it over on the x-axis and then I'll move it over on the y-axis. So you can just stick it right here and then what I want to do is duplicate this material so it's a separate material so that if we change some of the settings it won't affect the other material. So to do that we're going to click on this button right here, it looks like two little pieces of paper, that'll duplicate it so now you can see it has a .001 but we're just going to call it terrazzo tile 5. Then I want to get rid of the node group so we can change the settings. So if I click on the node group I'm going to press ctrl-alt-g, ctrl-alt-g will pull the nodes out of the node group and will just drag all the nodes right over here before the material output. So now right down here the small chunks, we want to select the small chunks group and we can delete it because we don't need it and then also this light in here we don't need that so I'm going to select it and press ctrl-x, ctrl-x will get rid of it but keep the nodes plugged up. And then here on the large chunks and small chunks I'm going to rename these so I'll select the node group and press f2 to give it a label and I'll just call this texture 1 and this one here I'll call texture 2. Now let's go over here to this distortion group and we want to change this noise texture scale and I'm going to change it to an 18 and that way this texture is a little bit bigger. So now I want to go over here to texture 1 and texture 2 and I want to change these settings so let's ctrl-shift and select texture 1 to preview it and I can change some of the settings here so I'm going to turn this scale to a 40. And then here on the color ramp I actually want to flip the values so I'll drag this white tab kind of to about here and then the black tab I'll drag kind of to about here. Let's ctrl-shift and select texture 2 and I can change the settings so on the voronoi scale here I'm going to turn this to a 25 and then I also want to change the color ramp so I'm going to drag the white tab over to about here and also the black tab kind of over to about there. So now you can see we have texture 1 and texture 2 and then they're being mixed together with this lighten because we already set this up in the previous part. So now you can see that this here is going into this mix and this is creating the colors but I want to change the color settings. So we're going to select this top color ramp here and I'll hit x to delete it and then we can drag this color ramp up here and we'll plug this into the factor. So now both of these mixes are going into this color ramp and then we can change some of the noise settings so for this scale I'm going to turn the scale to 30 and I'll turn the detail down to 8 because we don't need that much detail and the roughness I'll also turn to just like a 0.8. Now we can change where the color ramp is so let's ctrl-shift and select to depreviate and I want to drag the black tab over here and then the white tab kind of over here a bit so it's a bit less contrasty. So now I want to change the two colors here for both of these mix nodes. So for the top one here we're going to have like a orangey peachy color and then kind of a brownish color and the hex value that I'm going to be using is a hex value of D5, 8B, 5B, and then here on color B this is a brown color and the hex value will be 7C, 4, 3, 3, 1. Then here on the bottom mix we're going to make some gray colors and a black color so this gray color if you want to use the same value I'm using it's going to be a hex value of 3D, 4, 0, 3F or just make it a nice gray color and then for color B this is just going to be fully black so just turn the black all the way down to 0. So now I have this color here and this is going to be the chunks color and then we have this color here which is the background. So because the mixes are going here into A and B if I ctrl-shift and select this you can see the orange part is going to be where the chunks are but then the rest of it is going to be that black color. So I'll ctrl-shift and select the principled shade. And that is it for the procedural material so it was actually pretty easy to create and pretty quick because we just copied most of the settings from this other material. So let's join it together into a node group. First though I want to box select these reroutes and maybe bring them up just to make it look a bit nicer. So I'll box select all the nodes except the material output and I'm going to press ctrl-G to join it together into a node group. Let's hit the tab key to go out of the node group and I'll drag the node group over here and then I can drag it out to make it bigger and we can copy the material name and we can paste it here into the node group. Let's hit the tab key to go into the node group and I'll hit the N key to open the side panel and here on the group sockets I'll rename that to shader because I like that better. So now right over here we can take the root input and we can plug values up to it to control those values outside the node group. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket here and then let's click on the scale and I want to change the vector to float so it is one value and then we'll turn the default value to one. We'll go outside the node group and we'll turn this scale back to one so that's controlling the size of the entire material. So let's hit tab to go back into the node group. Then I want to control the tile scale so we have the brick scale right here. We can plug that into the extra socket and let's rename this to tile scale. Then I want to control the chunk colors so if I drag the root input right up here we have these two orangey brownish colors so I'll put A into the extra socket and B into the extra socket and I'll rename this to chunks color one and then chunks color two. Then I want to control the color scale which is going to be this noise scale right here. You can see that's kind of changing the scale of that texture so I'll put the scale into the extra socket and I'll rename this to color scale. Then I want to control the background colors so we'll drag this back up here and we can take the gray color put that in the extra socket and the black one in the extra socket and I'll rename this to background color one, copy that name and this one is going to be background color two. Then I want to control the scale of those chunks so let's drag this right down here and we'll drag it behind the voronois so we have both of these scale values to change the size of the chunks so I'll put both of these scale values into the extra sockets and also this one here into the extra socket and this one I'll rename to chunk scale one and then the second one I'll rename to chunk scale two. Then I want to control the individual size of the chunks so that's going to be controlled by this value here because the value is making it lighter and darker so that is controlling the size of it. So I'm going to put the value here from the hue saturation value into the extra socket and then we can take this hue saturation value and we can put the value into the same exact socket and this way this one value will control both of them at the same time. And then this one I'm going to rename to chunks individual size so outside of the node group you can see the chunks individual size is going to make them all bigger or smaller. So let's go back into the node group. So I now want to control the roughness so I'll drag this way over here towards the shader. Let's put the roughness value into the extra socket then we can drag this down here to control the bumps. So the first one that we have is the chunks so we'll put the strength into the extra socket and we'll rename this one to chunks bump strength. Then this one here that's going to be the noise so we'll put this into the extra socket and we'll rename this to noise bump strength. And the last one here this is controlling the tiles so we'll put the strength value into the extra socket and we'll rename this to tiles bump strength. Alright let's select the group input and drag it way back here. I'll hit tab to go out of the node group and I'll hit end to close the side panel and we can review this material. So we have the overall scale of the material then we just have the tile scale and then we also have the different chunks color so you could make it like a gray color you could make it more like a blue color but I kind of like the reddish orange. Then we have the color scale and then we also have the background color one and then we also have the second background color. Then we have the chunk scale one and the chunk scale two or you can drag them both to make them all really small. You can also control the chunks individual size to make them really big or small. Then you can control the roughness value and then also the bump strength the noise bump strength and the tiles bump strength. So that is it for that material so let's now create the final material. Alright so let's now create the final material and for the final material again it's going to be pretty similar to this one but we're just going to change some of the settings. So we're going to duplicate this object let's move it over on the y-axis and then we'll select this object here and we are going to click on this button here to duplicate the material. I will rename it to terrazzo tile six and then select the node group and you can press control alt G to bring it out of the node group and I can drag this over here. So now right up here on the color we want to select the color ramp we'll press control X to get rid of it and also this mix here let's press X to get rid of it and we can just drag this mix down here because we don't need that. Now you can see for this color right here it's now just become kind of a white color so I'm going to make this a very dark color and this is going to be the color of the cracks and the hex value for this dark gray is going to be a hex value of one nine one nine one nine. And let's go right back up here to this color mix here and this one I want to change these two colors as well and these are both going to be kind of gray. So color A here the hex value is going to be six five six five six five and then color B this is just going to be fully black. Now I want to make this look like little cracks instead of these large chunks. So if I go down here to texture one and texture two we have these values and if we turn these up it's going to make them look really thin. So here on both of these values I'm going to turn both of these values up to a 13. So they are very thin and now we kind of have that crack texture. We can also change some of the Voronoi settings on the top Voronoi I'm going to turn the scale to 31 and here on the bottom Voronoi I'm going to turn the scale to 17. And then we can also change the color ramp just to change the contrast a little bit. So I'll just drag the white tab over here and drag the black tab out a little bit so they're less contrasty. And on this one here I'm also going to drag the white tab over and drag the black tab over here so they're a bit less contrasty and that'll just kind of change the look of that. And that is it for the finished procedural material. So let's now join it together into a custom node group. So I'm going to box select all these nodes press control G to join it together into a node group. And if we hit the tab key to go out of the node group let's drag the node group over here and I'll make it a bit bigger and I can copy the material name and paste it here into the node group. So let's go into the node group and I'll hit the N key for the side panel and I'll rename this BSDF to shader because I like that better. I'll also make this smaller so I have a bit more space. So now we can plug up all the custom values to the group input. So we can first put the scale into the extra socket. We'll click on the scale and we'll change the type to flute so it is one value and the default value needs to be one. And if we go out of the node group we need to turn the scale back to one. So that's controlling the entire scale. So we'll go back into the node group. Then we also want to take the brick texture scale put that into the extra socket. And this one I'll rename to tile scale. Then I want to control the color scale so I'll drag group input up here and this noise texture scale can go into the scale there or into the extra socket. And this one I'll rename to color scale. Then I want to be able to control the cracks color. So if I drag this over here we have this dark color here and you can see if I turn this up that's controlling the color cracks. So let's put B into the extra socket here and then I can rename this to cracks color. Then I want to control the size of the cracks so I'll drag the group input down here and we can put the scale from this Voronoi into the extra socket and this Voronoi scale put that into the extra socket. And I'll rename this one to cracks scale one and then copy this and the other one is going to be cracks scale two. Then I want to control the thickness of the cracks and both of these hue saturation values we can drag these values to make it lighter and darker and that's going to change the thickness. So I'll put the value into the extra socket and this value is going to go into the same exact socket so we can control both of them at the same time. And then this one I'll rename to cracks thickness. And then I want to control the roughness so I'll drag this up here and I can put the roughness value into the extra socket and then we can have all the bumps. So the first one is the cracks so I'll put the strength into the extra socket and let's rename this to cracks bump strength. Then the second one here, plug that into the extra socket. This one is going to be the noise bump strength and then the last one here, put the strength into the extra socket and this is going to be tiles bump strength. So hit the N key to close the side panel, we'll drag the input over here and hit the tab key to go outside of the node group. We can now just review the final material. So we have the scale value, then we just have the tile scale and also the color scale and then we have the cracks color so you can make this brighter if you want to. We also have the cracks scale 1 and cracks scale 2. Then we have the cracks thickness so if you want to make it look more like a terrazzo tile you could turn this way up, maybe turn the cracks thickness to a 1.1 or something, that kind of looks cool. Then we also have the roughness, the cracks bump strength, the noise bump strength, and the tiles bump strength. So with that finished this will wrap up this tutorial on how to create all six of these customizable procedural terrazzo tile materials.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2lmQgktA3k,Procedural Hammered Copper Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural hammered copper material in Blender, including integrating it into a custom node group for flexibility in adjusting properties like scale, colors, metallic and roughness values, clear coat, and bump strengths. The tutorial also promotes additional resources, such as a procedural material pack available for purchase, and a course on creating a rusty fire hydrant model. The presenter provides step-by-step instructions on setting up the Blender scene, including modeling objects, applying modifiers, and configuring lighting using an HDRI.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural hammered copper material. And then after we create the material, I'll be showing you how to join it together into a custom node group. So we have the scale value, so you can change the size of the material depending on the size of your object. And then we have two colors, so color one is going to be inside those hammered parts. Sometimes I find this texture kind of has a little bit of a darkness, or those dots look a little bit darker. And then we also have color two, which is just the main metal color. Then we have the metallic value, so you can make it more or less metallic. We also have the roughness of the metal. And then we also have this clear coat here, which is an extra layer of shininess. And then we also have the clear coat roughness. Then we have the bump strength to make it more bumpy or more smooth. And then we also just have this noise bump strength, just to add a little bit of noise to the surface. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this procedural material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and Patreon page, the links are in the description. And you can also check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack to purchase all of my materials. And then before we start this part, I wanted to let you know about my recently released course, my Rusty Fire Hydrant Blender Tutorial Series. So that is a four-part tutorial series, and it's all step-by-step and in real time. And in the course, I show you how to create this rusty fire hydrant. So we start by modeling the fire hydrant, and then we set up some procedural materials. And then we do texture painting, and we paint on the model where we want the rust to be, and where we want the paint to be worn away. If you'd like to check out the course trailer video, I'll have the link to it in the description. And I'll also have the links to the product pages in the description. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport, if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I did. So I went to the Add menu, and I went to Mesh, and I added an icosphere. And then if you click right behind me on the Add Icosphere Settings, I turned the subdivisions up to 6, so it is nice and smooth and round. And then I shaded the object smooth. And then to model this better to the real-life scale in Blender, I'm going to scale this object down by 0.2, and then I will press Ctrl-A and apply the scale. And then to model the vase, I thought it would be cool to add it to a vase, because vases sometimes have this hammered copper. So I went to the Add menu, and I just added a cylinder. And you can just go into Edit Mode, and I just scaled the cylinder way down. And then you can just go into Wireframe, and you can just box select the top of it, and you can bring that down, and then you can just kind of extrude it and scale it up, and extrude it and scale it, and you can just model it to the shape of a vase. So here is the vase model that I created. And then to give it a bit of thickness after you model it, you can go here to the Modifier Properties, and you can add the Solidify modifier. And then also just to smooth it out, you can add the Subdivision Surface modifier to smooth it out. So that's what I did for the vase model. Then I also added a camera here, and I just pointed the camera right at the objects. And if you click on the camera and go to the Object Data properties of the camera, I turned the focal length to 80 just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit. Now as for the lighting, over here on the World Properties, I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDRI from polyhaven.com. So I'll have the link in the video description if you'd like to download it. And I just downloaded the 1K HDR version. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to Color, and you can choose Environment Texture, and then just click on the Open button and open up the HDRI. So I'm in the Shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the Rendered mode. And then I have the Shader Editor right over here, so I'll just click on New to add a new material. And I can click and drag here on the materials and drop it onto this material, or drop it onto that object so they both have the same material. And then I'm just going to rename this to Hammered Copper. And then I'll also be using the Node Wrangler add-on, so you can click on Edit, you can go to the Preferences, and then over here on the Add-ons tab, if you go to the Search, you can search for Node and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture, let's drop the Voronoi here, and I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and select the Voronoi texture to preview it. Now you can see on some of these objects, you can see that the Voronoi is being stretched a little bit, so if I select the Voronoi texture and press Ctrl-T, that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes, and I want to plug the object into the vector, and that way it's using the object coordinates, so it's going to place the texture on the object more evenly. And then we'll change some of the settings, so I'm going to turn the Scale to 70, and then I'm going to turn this F1 here to Smooth F1 instead. And then on this smoothness here, I'm going to turn this to a 0.6, so it is a bit smooth, but not quite as much. And then this random value here, I find that actually turning the random value down a bit to like a 0.8 looks a bit better, so you can see if I turn the random value all the way down, you can clearly see those lines there, and that doesn't look that great, but if I turn it all the way up, it's just a little bit too random for me, so I like a randomness of 0.8. So let's plug the Distance here into the Normal to give it some bump, and I'll Ctrl Shift and select the Principled Shader to preview it, but you can see that there's some weird shading issues, that's because we need to search for a bump node, and we're going to put the bump node between the Voronoi and the Principled Shader, and the Distance needs to be going into the Height value to convert it to bump data. So now you can see it looks very bumpy, and let's turn the Bump Strength all the way down to a 0.08, so it's not quite as strong. And then also to see it a bit better, let's take the Base Color here, and for now we're just going to make it kind of like a dark color, and kind of make it a bit brown, so we can kind of see that better. Now I do want to kind of change the shape of the bump, so to do this, we're going to search for a Map Range node, which we can use to change the colors. So we're going to put this between the Voronoi and the bump. Now we can take the From Min value, and we can turn this down and up, and you can see that's going to change it, but first let's uncheck the clamping, so it won't clamp the values. So now I can turn the From Min down and up, and I'm going to turn the From Min to a negative 4.37, so a negative 4.37. And then here on the To Min here, you can see I can drag this around, and that's going to kind of change it, and I'm kind of doing this to make it more smooth. So on the To Min, I'm going to turn this to a 0.78, just a 0.78. So now you can see the edges here of the hammered copper looks a bit more smooth, whereas if I just mute the node, you can see it looks a bit more sharp, but by using the Map Range there, we're kind of smoothing it out by dragging those values up. Now I do want to make it even more smooth, so I'm also going to search for the RGB Curves node, and we're going to put this RGB Curves between the Voronoi and the Map Range. And I can click here to add a dot, and then I can drag this dot kind of up here, and I can click here to add another dot, and I can drag this dot way down here. So by adding this curve here, you can see it's going to smooth it out even more. You can see here it is without it, so it kind of looks a bit sharp on the edges, but then here it is before, you can see it looks quite a bit more smooth. So I now want to take that Voronoi Distance here, and I want to put that into the base color of the Principle Shader, but then I want to change the colors. So I first want to search for a Color Ramp to kind of change the contrast, so I'll put the Color Ramp here between the Voronoi and the base color, stick it there. And then I'm going to hold down the Ctrl key and click here to add a tab here, and then this tab I'm going to drag over a bit to make it a bit more contrasty and sharp. And then this tab here, which is kind of gray in the middle, I'm just going to make this kind of a mid-gray color, and the hex value for this color is going to be 93, 93, 93. So you can punch that in there if you want to use the same hex value that I'm using. So now to make the custom colors, I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a Mix Color, and we'll put that here after the Color Ramp, and the Color Ramp color is going to go into the Factor to control what part is going to be color A and what part is going to be color B. So now I'll make the two colors, and they're going to be kind of like these brownish colors, and Color A is going to be a hex value of 6F, 4C, 3, 4. And then Color B is going to be slightly brighter. This is going to be a hex value of 7C, 5, 5, 3A. And then to make this look like metal, let's turn the metallic value all the way up to 1. And also I'll leave the roughness at 0.5 for now because I like how that looks. Now let's also open up the code here because I want to add some clear coat, and the clear coat is basically going to be an extra layer of shininess, so it's going to look like maybe it has some sort of painted finish on it which is really shiny. So I'll turn the coat weight all the way up to 1, and then the coat roughness I'll turn to a 0.3. Now one problem with this is that it kind of makes the bump be less strong because it's adding this kind of layer of shininess. You can see if I turn the roughness down, you can still see the bump, but it almost looks like there's this thick layer of plastic or something over the top of it. So what I'm going to do is take this bump normal, and I'm going to put that into the same normal here of the clear coat. So that way, both the clear coat and the normal shader, they're both going to be using the same normal value or the same bump there. So you can see it still looks pretty bumpy even though we have the clear coat. And then I also want to add just a little bit of surface bump with some noise. So what I'm going to do is select the bump node and I'll duplicate it and drop it here. We can put the normal into the normal of this one, so they're both going into the normals here, the two normals of the shader. So now we can add another value into the height value. So to do this, I'm going to search for a noise texture. We can just drop the noise texture here, and we can also use the same object coordinate. So we're going to take the mapping vector, and we're going to put that into the vector of the noise. Let's Ctrl Shift and select the noise to preview it, and I can change some of the noise settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to a 40, and then I'm going to turn the detail to the max of 15, and the roughness I'll turn to like a 0.55, so it has a little bit more roughness. So now the noise texture factor can go to the height value of the bump, and I can Ctrl Shift and select the principal shader to preview it. And then here on the bump, I want to turn this to a very, very small number. So on the second bump here, I'm going to turn it to a 0.03, and that way she's going to have a very subtle roughness there, or a little bit of bump there over the surface. And that is it for the procedural material, so I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So I'll click and drag to box select all the nodes, and I'll press Ctrl G to join it together into a node group. And if you hit the tab key with the node group selected, that's going to go in and out of the node group. So I'll drag the node group over here. Let's drag it out to make it bigger, and then I can click on the name here. Actually, I'm going to copy the name here, so press Ctrl C, and then press Ctrl V there to paste the hammered copper name into the node group. Let's hit the tab key to go into the node group, and I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel. And if you click here on the group tab, you can see there's these group sockets, and I'm going to double click on this, and I'll rename this to shader because I like that better. So now over here, we have this group input, and we can plug values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures, so the scale value can go into the group input. Then I can click on the scale here, and I don't want it to be three values. I want it to be one instead. So we'll click on the vector here, and we're going to change it to float instead. And by turning it to float, it's just going to be one value. Now the default value here, we can turn to one, and then I can hit tab to go out of the node group, and we need to turn the scale back to one. So now we can go into the node group. And then I want to control the colors, so I'll drag the group input right up here, and I can put color A into the extra socket and color B into the extra socket. Let's rename these, so I'll rename this to color one, and this one here, I'll rename to color two. And then let's also plug the metallic value into the extra socket and the roughness into the extra socket. We'll drag this down here to the clear coat, and we can take the coat weight, put that into the extra socket. And I want to rename this to clear coat, because I just like that better. So I'm going to rename that to clear coat. Then we have the roughness here for the clear coat, so I'll put that into the extra socket. And this, I'll double click on it to rename it, and I'll rename it to clear coat roughness. And then also I want to control the bump strength. So I'll first take the first bump strength, and I'll put that into the extra socket. And I'm just going to call this bump strength. And then I also want to control the noise bump strength, so that's the second one here. So I'll put the strength into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to noise bump strength. All right, I'll drag the node group back over here, and I'll hit the N key to close the side panel, and I'll hit the tab key to go outside the node group. We can now review the final material. So we have the overall scale, and then we also have color one, and then we also have color two. Then we have the metallic value and the roughness. We also have the clear coat and the clear coat roughness. And then we have the bump strength, and if you turn it way up, that actually looks pretty cool. You can see there's all these little circles here. So that looks kind of cool, but I don't want it to be that strong. I like it as a more subtle value. And then we also have the noise bump strength. So that's going to be it for this video. So I hope you enjoyed the tutorial, and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjaIztl0dpU,How to Make Party Balloons in Blender🎈(Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to model realistic balloons and create three procedural balloon materials: a randomly colored balloon that changes color upon duplication, a polka-dotted balloon, and a balloon with a custom color. The tutorial covers setting up the base balloon material, adjusting properties like roughness, transparency, and transmission, and using node groups to organize these features. It also shows how to apply a custom image, such as a happy birthday logo, onto the balloon using UV mapping and mixing colors. The tutorial concludes with information on purchasing the project files and accessing additional resources for learning procedural materials in Blender.","In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create realistic balloons in Blender. So I'll first be showing you how to model the balloons, and then we'll be creating three procedural balloon materials. So the first one here is this balloon random color. So this one will change the color whenever you duplicate the object. Then we have a polka-dotted balloon, and then we also have this balloon here, and this one has a custom color. And after we create each procedural material, I'll show you how to join them together into custom node groups. So for the first one here, this is just the base balloon material. So we have the base color, so you can change this to whatever color you want. Then we have the roughness of the balloon to make it more rough or shiny. Then we have the transparency if you want to make the balloon more invisible so you can see through it. And then we have this transmission value, and this is kind of that clear plastic. So if you want it to be very clear, you can kind of see through the balloon more, or you can turn the transmission down if you want it to be less clear. Then we also have this clear coat, and the clear coat is basically a shininess of the surface of the balloon. You can kind of see there's that little shininess there on the plastic. Then we also have the clear coat roughness to make that clear coat more rough or more shiny. And then we also have the clear coat tint. Then we have the polka dot balloon. So for this one, we have the dot scale, and then we also have the dot's individual size. And then we have the balloon color, which is that main color. And then we also have the dots color. Then we have the randomness of those dots, and we also have the roughness of the balloon. We have the transmission value of the balloon, so you can make it more see-through or less see-through. Then we also have the transparency if you just want to make the balloon more invisible. And then we have the clear coat as well, and the clear coat roughness to kind of add that shininess on the surface of the balloon, and then also the clear coat tint. And then finally, we have this balloon random color. So this one here, if I duplicate it, it's going to randomly generate a different color. So if you're creating like a birthday party scene or something, maybe you're creating a birthday card or something, and you want to have like a 3D render of some balloons, you can just quickly duplicate them. You can make all these different colored balloons. So for this one, we have the hue of the balloon, so you can change the hue. You can also change the saturation, and then you can also change the value. So those are three colors you can change. You can also change the transmission here. And then again, we have the clear coat, and we have the clear coat roughness. And then we have this clear coat tint if you want to kind of change that. Then we have the roughness of the balloon. And then finally, the transparency. And then at the very end of this tutorial, I'll show you how you can add a logo on the balloon. So for example, if you wanted to add like a happy birthday image onto the balloon, I'll show you how you can add that onto the color map.

You can also purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create more procedural materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. The links are in the description. So let's start by modeling the balloon objects. But if you already have a balloon object and you want to jump straight to the procedural material, then you can check the timestamps in the video description or in the YouTube timeline, and you can just jump to the part where we create the material. So let's go to the add menu, and I'm going to start by adding a UV sphere. And I'll scale the UV sphere down by 0.2, and I'll press Control-A and apply the scale. Then I'm going to press Control-2 to add a subdivision surface with two levels, and I'll use the object context menu and shade it smooth. Then I'll hit the Tab key to go into edit mode, and I'm going to click on this button here to turn on the proportional editing, and I'm going to select the bottom vertex, and I'll bring it down on the Z-axis. Let's scroll our mouse wheel to make the proportional editing bigger, and I'll just bring it down like that, and that's pretty much the shape of the balloon. I might want to select a loop here, though, and maybe bring the loop down just to make it a little bit more even, but that's pretty close to the balloon shape. Then I'm going to zoom in here, and I'll hold down the Alt key and select that loop there, and I'll duplicate it, and then I'll scale it in. Actually, we need to turn off the proportional editing first, and then we can scale it in and bring it down. Let's just scale it down like that. And I'll zoom into this and scale it down even more, and then bring it up inside the balloon, and I'll extrude it and bring it down, and then I can extrude it again and rotate it, and extrude it again and rotate it, and start to scale it up. We'll extrude it again, and then extrude it again and scale it really big, and then we'll extrude this again, and then we'll extrude it, and then immediately after, we're going to scale it. Let's scale that down there, and then we can extrude it back in. All right, just like that. Let's hold down the Z button, go into wireframe. We can extrude it again and scale it down, and then extrude it back one more time. All right, go back to solid view. So that's looking pretty good, but you can see there's some weird issues there. That's because we need to select everything in edit mode and press Shift N to recalculate the normals, and that's going to fix that. So let's press the L key with our mouse hovered over that spot there, and we can scale it down and bring it up. We're just going to stick it there in the bottom of the balloon, and we'll use the object context menu and shade it smooth. And I think that could be a little bit bigger. So in edit mode, I'm going to scale that up a little bit bigger. All right, so something like that is pretty good. We now have that little part there, which is tied at the end. So now let's go back into edit mode, and I'll go to the add menu, and for the ribbon, I'm going to add a plane, and we'll scale the plane down really small, and I'm going to bring it over. Let's also rotate it on the X axis and scale it down pretty small. We're just going to stick it right there, and then we're going to select the two vertices here on the end, and we'll extrude it and extrude it again, and we're just going to extrude it all the way around here. So just extrude it around that balloon there on the bottom, and if it's going through, you might want to go to the edge select and kind of pull that edge out there. Go to the edge select again and extrude that out. We can just kind of have it overlap the first one. All right, and then I can start to rotate it down. We can extrude it down, and then if we go to front view, I can extrude it and rotate it and extrude it and extrude it again and extrude it again like that, and at the very end here, let's just extrude it a little bit so that it's kind of sharp there. Let's go back to object mode, and again, we'll shade it smooth with the object context menu, and I think in edit mode, I also want to select the ribbon and maybe scale the ribbon up on the Z axis and bring it down a little bit and kind of rotate it and just make the ribbon kind of moving along there. All right, so that is it for the balloon. So then I just duplicated the balloon object three times so that there are now three balloons, and then I also added this camera here and I just pointed the camera at the objects, and if I select the camera and go over here to the object data properties, I turn the focal length of the camera up to 80 just to kind of zoom it in a bit. Now, as for the lighting, I started out by adding this area light right here, so it's just a big area light to add some nice reflections, and I turned the power to 50, and then also if I go here to the world properties, I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDRI from polyhaven.com, so I'll have the link in the video description if you'd like to download it to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections, and after you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot next to color, you can choose environment texture, and then just click on the open button and open up the downloaded HDRI. So now let's go here to the render properties, and I'm going to use the Cycles rendering engine because I'm going for realism, but you could also use Blender Eevee if you want to, and then let's open up the film tab here, and I check mark the transparent button just so the background is transparent, so it's not quite as distracting. It kind of looks nicer in the scene, and then also I went here to the color management, and I turned the view transform to filmic, and I set the look to very high contrast. So I'm in the shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I have the shader editor right over here, so I'll just select the first balloon. I'll click on new to add a new material, and I'm going to actually make the ribbon material first. So now for this material, I'm going to make the base color fully black, and then I'm going to turn down the roughness a bit so it's a bit more shiny. So now let's click and drag and drop the ribbon material onto all of these other balloons, but then what I'm going to do is go into edit mode, and let's actually bring out the side panel here, and I'll deselect everything, and then use the L key to select the parts of the mesh, which are the balloon. So now if I click over here to go to the material properties, I want to click on the plus here to add a new material. Let's click on new, and I can call it balloon, and then I will click on the assign button. So now the balloon material is just on the top of the balloon, and then I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on in the video, so to enable it, you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences, and then over here on the add-ons tab, you can just search for Node, and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So we're first going to start by just creating the base balloon material. So we're going to start by making it whatever color you want, so you can change this to whatever color you want. I'm going to go with this bright red color, and if you want to use the same color I'm using, the hex value will be FF0000. And then I want to turn this roughness down to a 0.4 so the balloon is a bit more shiny. So now let's open up this transmission here, and I'm going to turn the transmission weight to a 0.8, and that's going to make it look like this very thin plastic, so it kind of has that rubbery material, and it's kind of see-through. Then let's open up the coat here, because I want to add kind of that shiny coat on the surface, and I'll turn the coat weight all the way up to one, and then on the roughness here, I'll turn this to a 0.14 on the coat weight. And that is it for the basic procedural balloon material. So I'll now join this together into a custom node group, and we'll just add the values that we want to control. So I'll just select the principled shader, I'll press Control-G to join it together into a node group. Now if you hit the N key to open up the side panel, because this was just one node, it added all of the values to the custom node group. So if you hit the N key for the side panel and go to the group tab, I'm going to click on the very bottom one here, and then I will scroll up here and I'll hit the minus button, and I'm just going to get rid of all of these. So I'll just continue to hit the minus button and just get rid of all of them except the BSDF, and then I'll double click on the BSDF and I'll rename it to shader because I like that better. So now I can start by plugging up all the custom values. So I first want to plug the base color into the group input, and then let's also plug the roughness into the group input because I want to control that. And then this alpha here, let's plug that up. And the alpha, I'm going to double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename this to transparency. Then I want the weight, so the transmission weight, let's plug that into the extra socket. And instead of transmission weight, I'll just call it transmission. Then let's take the coat weight here, plug that up, and instead of coat weight, I'm just going to call it clear coat because I like that better. And then also the roughness, we'll plug this up here, and I'll double click on this to rename it, and I'll call it clear coat roughness. And then also the tint here, we'll plug that into the extra socket, and I'll rename this again to clear coat tint. All right, so I'll hit the tab key to go out of the node group, and I can close that side panel. Let's drag this out to make it bigger and drag it over here. And then I can copy the material name and I can paste it here into the node group, so it is called balloon. So now we have the base color, so we can control the base color. We also have the roughness of the balloon, and we also have the transparency if we want to make it super transparent and see-through. And then we also have the transmission. Then we have the clear coat, and we also have the clear coat roughness to kind of add that second level of shininess. And then we also have the clear coat tint if we just want to add a tint to that clear coat. So that's it for the first balloon material. So we'll select the second one now. We're going to open up the side panel. We're going to go into edit mode, and I'll hit the L key with my mouse hovered over these two pieces, and that's going to be the balloon. So we'll click on the plus here to add a new material. Let's click on new, and then I'll rename this material to balloon polka dots, and then I will click on the assign button so it has that material on the object. So I'll close the side panel, and this material, we'll use a few more nodes, but it's still going to be pretty simple. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's drop it here. And I can control shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. We can go back to object mode just to see that. Now you can see that the Voronoi is really stretched. So if I select the Voronoi, I'll press control T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping, and that's the feature of the node wrangler. Now I want to use the object coordinate, so I'll plug the object up to the vector, and now it is placed correctly on the mesh so it's not distorted or stretched. So now let's change some of the Voronoi settings. So I'll turn the scale to a 2.9, and then this random value here, I'm going to turn this to a 0.456. So a 0.456, I find that's just a good value to make it look more random so that the dots aren't overlapping each other. So now I want to make them more contrasty, so I will search for a color ramp, and we'll put this right here. And I'll drag the black tab over here, and then I'm going to flip the white tab, and I'll drag it over here. And then you can change the size of the dots. So now if I go back to the Voronoi texture, you can see if the random value is turned to one, you can see there's a lot of the dots which are overlapping. So that's why I turned down the random so that not all of the dots are overlapping. So that looks a little bit better. Now, later on in the custom node group, I'm going to want to change the size of the dots. So if I go to the add menu, I'll search for the hue saturation value, and I'll put it between the Voronoi and the coloring. So now I can change the value, and that is going to make it brighter or darker. So that is going to change the size of each one of those polka dots. And then finally, I want to make the custom colors. So we'll go to the add menu, and we're going to search for a mix color. We'll drop this here, and the color ramp can color can go into the factor. So now I can make the two colors here in A and B. So for color A, I'm going to make this kind of like a purple-y color, but of course, change it to whatever you want. And for color B, I'll make this fully white. And for color A, if you want to use the same exact hex value that I'm using, you can punch in a hex value of 72, 3CFF, and then of course for color B, just make sure that's fully white. So now the mixed result can go into the base color, and I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. So now let's also change some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the roughness to a 0.32, so it is more shiny, and we'll open up the transmission. And again, I'll turn the transmission weight to a 0.8. Then we'll open up the coat here, and I'll turn the coat weight all the way up to one, and I'll turn the roughness to a 0.13. And that is it for the procedural material. So let's now join it together into a node group. So I'll box select all the nodes, except the material output. I'll press control G to join it together into a node group, and I'll hit the tab key to go out of the node group, and I'll drag the node group over here. We will copy the material name, and we're going to paste it here in the node group, and let's also make it a bit bigger. So now I'll go into the node group, and I'll hit the N key to open the side panel, and I'm going to click here to rename this, and I'll rename that to shader. So outside of the node group, you can see that socket there is called the shader, because I like that better. So now we can plug up all the custom values. So I first want to control the dot scale. So we'll take the Voronoi scale here, and we'll put that into the extra socket here, and I'll double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename it to dot scale. Then I want to control the dot size. So we have this value here on the hue saturation value that'll change the size, so we'll put the value into the extra socket there. Double click on this, and I'll rename it to dots size, or you could call it dots individual size, or whatever makes sense for you. Then I want to control the colors, so I'll drag the group input over here, and I'll put color A into the extra socket, and then color B into the extra socket. So color A is going to be called balloon color, and color B is going to be called dots color. Let's also drag this back here, and we'll take the randomness of the Voronoi texture and stick that into the extra socket as well. And then I also want to control the roughness, so I'll put the roughness over here, or let's drag the group input over here towards the roughness. We can take the roughness from the principles shader and put that to the extra socket. Then we're going to take the alpha here, and we'll put the alpha into the extra socket, and I'll rename it transparency, and then we'll take the transmission weight, we'll put that into the extra socket, and this I'm just going to rename to transmission. Then we'll add the clear coat, so let's drag this down here, and we can take this weight here, we'll put that into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to clear coat weight. Then we have the roughness, plug that into the extra socket, I'll rename this to clear coat roughness, and then also the tint, put that into the extra socket, and let's rename this to clear coat tint. All right, I'll drag this over here, and we'll hit the tab key to go out of the node group, and I will close the side panel. Now let's just make sure this material is working correctly, so we have the dot scale, we have the dot size, then we also have the balloon color, and we also have the dots color, we have the randomness of the dots, the balloon roughness, the transparency, and also the transmission, and then we have the coat weight, we have the clear coat roughness, and then also the clear coat tint. So that's it for the balloon polka dots, so let's now do the last one here, so I'll select the last balloon, new material, so go over here to the side panel, we're gonna click on the plus here to add new material, let's click on new, and I'll rename this to balloon random color, so we'll hit the tab key to go into edit mode, I'll hit the L key to select both of those two parts of the balloon, and I'll click on the assign button. All right, so now we'll create the random colored balloon. So to make the random colors, I'll go to the add menu, and I'm gonna search for the object info node, let's put this here. Now this random value on the object info is gonna randomly generate colors from white to black per object, so when I duplicate the objects, each object will be a different color. So I'll put the random into the base color, but then to make all the custom colors, we can add a color ramp. We'll put the color ramp after the object info, and now what I can do is make all the colors, so I'll first click here, and I'm gonna start by making this kind of like a yellow color, you can hold down the control key and click to add another tab, and then this one here, I'm gonna make like an orangey color, click here to add another tab, and this one I'll make like a red color, click here to add another tab, and this one we're gonna make kind of like a pink color, we'll add another one here, and we're gonna do like a purpley color, maybe a dark purple, then we're gonna add a blue color, so let's do that, then I can also maybe do a light blue, that would be pretty cool as well, and then finally this last one here, this one is going to be a green color, so we'll make that a bright green. Now if I duplicate this, move it over here, if I just continue to duplicate this, you can see what it's doing, however, one thing that I don't wanna do, is I don't wanna have it blend between these two colors, I want to just be the colors that we selected, so we'll click on the linear here, and we'll change it to constant instead, so now you can see it's just gonna be the colors that we chose, and if you want it to be like more blue, you could turn this up, so there's more of a chance of it being blue, or more red, so you can kind of drag these around, but I'm gonna make them pretty even, let's also drag the green one out, cause we want some of them to be green, so I'll make these pretty even, pretty even spacing, so just like that, so I'm gonna just delete these extra balloons here, because I don't need them, so now we'll select the main balloon again, and we can now do a few more settings, so I wanna add a hue saturation value here, so let's go to the add menu, we're gonna search for hue, we'll put the hue saturation value between the color ramp and the principal shader, so now we have the hue, and the saturation, and the value settings, so we can use that in the custom node group, so now we'll just do the same exact settings as we've done before, so I'll turn the roughness down, and for this one I'm gonna turn this to a .35, then we'll open up the transmission here, and I'll turn the transmission weight to a .8, and then we'll open up the coat settings here, and the coat I'll turn all the way up to one, the coat roughness I'll turn to a .13, and then I'll leave the tint how it is, so let's join this together into a node group, so I'll box select the nodes, hit control G to join it together into a node group, and we can add up all the custom values, so I first wanna add the hue, and the saturation, and the value just to edit the colors, so I'll put the hue, the saturation, and the value up to the group input, then let's add the alpha, so I'll put the alpha there into the extra socket, we'll hit the N key to open up the side panel, and I'm gonna rename this to transparency, then let's add the transmission weight, stick that into the extra socket, and I'll just rename this to transmission, then we'll also take the coat weight, and the coat roughness, and also the tint, and then if I rename these, I'm gonna just add the word clear, so clear coat, and I don't wanna use the weight here, so just clear coat, and then clear coat roughness, and then the last one here is gonna be clear coat tint, and then also let's add the roughness of the material, so put the roughness into the extra socket there, and I can actually click and drag, and drag the roughness up here, so it's more at the top, so let's drag the group input over here, I'll hit the N key to close the side panel, and we'll hit tab to go out of the node group, so I'll drag the end of the node group out, so it's a bit bigger, drag it over here, and we can copy the name, and we can paste it here into the node group, so now let's just make sure this is working correctly, so we have the hue, and also the saturation, and also the value, then we have the roughness, the transparency, and the transmission, we also have the clear coat, the clear coat roughness, and then finally the tint if we wanna change that, and then also if I duplicate this, you can see every time I duplicate the balloon, it's gonna be a random different color, now the last thing that I'm gonna do in this video is show you how to add an external image texture, so I downloaded a happy birthday image from Pixabay, it's a free image, you can download it with the link in the description if you wanna follow along, so what I'm gonna do is select the first balloon that we added, and I'll hit tab to go into the node group, and I'll drag your input back here, and what I'm actually gonna do is just unplug the base color here, so we'll just unplug that, so that we have the base color now, so I'll press shift A, we'll go to the search, we're gonna search for an image texture, we'll drop the image here, and then I'll click on the open button, and here is the happy birthday image that I downloaded from Pixabay, again link will be in the description if you wanna download this, or just use whatever image you wanna add, now something that is important about this image is that it has an alpha transparency, so I can just add this on top of the original color, so I'll click on this image, and click on open, and now I can put the color into the base color, and we can see where it's gonna show up, now if for some reason it's set this to UDIM tiles, I don't know why Blender does this, but it does for some images, so if you click on the UDIM tiles, just change this to single image, because we don't wanna use the UDIM tiles, now you can see the image isn't showing up, so what I actually wanna do is take the alpha, we'll put the alpha into the base color, so we can see the transparency, so now what we need to do is we need to UV unwrap the object to place it where we want, so I've already UV unwrapped it, so it does look kinda good where it is, the happy birthday is right there, but I'll just show you how I'm gonna UV unwrap this, so I'll go into edit mode, and I'll go to the side here, and I'll hold down the alt key and select that loop there, and then hold down the shift and alt key, and select that other loop right there, so now we kind of have half of it selected, I'll hit U, and we are going to mark seam, then if I select everything, I'll hit the U button, and we can just click on unwrap to unwrap it, so now you're gonna need to go over to the UV editor, so you can click here to go to the UV editing workspace, and if I zoom in here, I can go up into the rendered viewport mode to see how this is looking, and just press the A key to make sure you select the entire mesh, and so here's the UVs, so I can scale them, and I can move them around, and I can rotate them, and you can just stick this to where you want, so I'm gonna stick this here, this is the front of the balloon, so I can rotate it and scale it, and then if I deselect everything, I'll hit the L key to select the back of the balloon, and I can rotate it and move it over, and we will just stick that in there and kind of stick it on top, and then if I select everything, I think I'll scale everything up a little bit, so now you can see if I look over here on the side, you can see that the happy birthday text is going around the balloon, so now we'll go back over here to the shading, we'll go into the rendered viewport mode, and you can see the happy birthday is like all over the place, so if you like that, you can leave that how it is, but I'm instead gonna click on the repeat, and I'm gonna change it to clip instead, so it's gonna clip it, so now you can see the happy birthday text is just on the front and the back, now this has an alpha transparency, so I wanna mix it on top of the red image, so to do this, we'll go to the add menu, and I'm gonna search for the mix color, and we're gonna drop the mix color here right here after the image, so drop it there, and we're gonna take the alpha, and we're gonna put that into the factor, so that's determining what parts are gonna be color A, and what parts are gonna be color B, so now if I unplug the base color here, I can take this red color, and I can put this here into color A and color B, so we'll take the result, and we'll put that into the base color, so now I believe it's color B, let's turn down the color, yeah, so it's color B, so for color A, you can make this the main balloon color, and then for color B, this is gonna be the text color, so I like fully black, I think fully black looks pretty good, so you can just make it fully black, so now you can see that because we're using the alpha, the alpha is just black and white, so that is determining what part's A, and what part is B, so now you can see that we have the red balloon, and then it looks like the text is on top, so this isn't procedural of course, because it's an external image texture, but that is how you can add text onto a balloon, so then if you wanted to plug this up to the custom colors, you could like plug A into the base color, and then if you take B, you could plug this into the extra socket, if I hit the N key to open up the side panel, I could double click on this to rename it, and I could call it like text color, I could also drag the text color right up here, next to the base color, so now if I go outside of the node group, and just control shift and select this shader to preview it, you can see we now have a custom color for the text, and we also have a custom color here for the base color, so that's gonna wrap it up for this tutorial, so I hope you found this helpful, and thank you for watching, and if you'd like to purchase the project files to get all the balloons

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjf5uQuH3oQ,Procedural Giraffe Fur Pattern Material 🦒 (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural giraffe fur pattern material in Blender, including a preview on a giraffe model downloaded from BlendSwap. The tutorial covers the steps to build the material, detailing how to manipulate various parameters such as scale, pattern distortion, detail levels, and colors. It also includes instructions for setting up a custom node group to adjust the material's properties easily. The video ends with information on purchasing the material and related packs from the creator's Gumroad store and Patreon, as well as a recommendation for a Blender add-on called Oven for efficient texture baking.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural giraffe fur pattern material. And then I also wanted to preview what the fur pattern would look like on a giraffe model, so I downloaded this giraffe model from BlendSwap, I'll have a link in the description if you want to download the same model. So after we create the procedural material, I'll also show you how to join it together into this custom node group. So we have the scale value to change the size of the entire material, then we also just have the pattern scale, and then we also have the pattern distortion, then we have two detail levels, so detail 1 and detail 2, and then we have the pattern color, which is kind of that lighter color, then we also have the fur color 1, which is the brown color, and then fur color 2, which is that black color. And then we also have the fur darkness, so you can make it lighter or darker, and then we also have the pattern thickness to make that pattern thinner or thicker, and then we have the fur scale, we also have the bump strength of that fur surface, and then we have some sheen values, because I turned up the sheen, because I wanted to give it kind of that look that makes it look a little bit like fabric or cloth, because it is fur, so we have the sheen tint, then we also have the sheen weight, and then also the sheen roughness. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this procedural material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and Patreon page with the links in the description. And you can also check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack if you'd like to purchase all of my materials, and my Ultimate Material Pack comes with all of my materials, preset up for Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. You can also purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create more procedural materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. And then one more thing before we start, I wanted to let you know about a really great Blender add-on for easy, fast texture baking. Oven is an amazing Blender add-on for speeding up the baking process. Start by UV unwrapping your objects. You can then select the objects that you want to bake. You can then choose what maps to bake, like the color, roughness, normal, metallic, and more maps. Then choose your preferred settings, like where to export the textures, the file name, file type, and texture size. Then hit Bake, and the add-on will automatically bake all the textures and export them to your computer. Then click the Recreate Materials button, and the add-on will automatically replace the material with a new material using the baked textures. You can find my full add-on review video with the link in the description, and by purchasing through my link, you'll be helping to support this channel. So real quick, I'll just show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the Add menu, and I added in Icosphere. And then right behind me on the Add Icosphere settings, I just turned the subdivisions up to 6, so it is nice and smooth and round. And I'm going to shade the object smooth. And then I'll scale the object down by 0.2. And I will press Ctrl-A and apply the scale. Then to add in the giraffe model, you can click on File, and you can click on Append. And you can locate to the folder with the giraffe model. Again, I'll have a link in the description to the model and blend swap if you want to download it. You can go to the Animals Blender file. And then you can go to Object, and then you can just select the giraffe model. And then you can scale it down. Let's move it down here. Let's rotate it over. And I'll press Ctrl-A and apply the scale. Then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if I go over here to the object data properties of the camera, I turned the focal length up to 104 just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit so it looks a bit more flat. And I like the look of that better. And then let's go into the rendered viewport mode. So I also added a few lights. So I added this big area light kind of on the back, and I turned the power to 60. Then this one here, this is just another light that I duplicated. And then I also added some HDRI lighting. So if I go here to the world properties, I added in this Photo Studio 01 1K HDRI from polyhaven.com. I'll have the link in the video description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version on Polyhaven. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on this yellow dot next to color, and you can choose environment texture, and then just click on the open button and open up the HDRI. And then let's go up here to the render properties. I'm going to be using the Cycles rendering engine because I'm going for realism, but you could also use Eevee if you want to. I'm also going to open up the film tab here and turn on the transparent button so the background is transparent. And I'll also use the color management of AGX, and I'll set the look to very high contrast. So I'm going to go over to the shading workspace. So I now have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mode. And I have the shader editor right here, so I'll just select an object and add a new material. And I can just rename the material. And then I'll also click and drag and drop the material onto this object so they both have the same material. And then I'll also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in the video. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences, and if you go to the add-ons tab, you can search for Node and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So what I first want to do is go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's Ctrl-Shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. And I'm also going to press Ctrl-T with the Voronoi texture selected. That's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I want to use the object coordinates, so we're going to plug the object into the vector. And the object coordinates will place the textures on the object more evenly. And then right here on the scale of the Voronoi, I'm going to turn this up to a 25, and also I'm going to change the F1 to distanced edge so we have that cool pattern. Now I want to add a bit of detail to it, so in between the mapping and the Voronoi, I'm going to search for a noise texture, and I'll drop it here. So the noise texture is going through the vector, so it's distorting the placement of the Voronoi. So now let's change some of the settings of the noise. So I'll turn the noise texture scale to 8. I'm also going to turn the detail to 8, and then I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now that's distorted way too much, so to have the noise texture have less of an effect over the Voronoi, I'll go to the add menu, and I'll search for a mix color, and we'll put this between the two textures there. Now, this mapping vector here, which isn't distorted at all, that is going to go into color A. And then we're going to take the factor of the noise texture, and we're going to put that into color B. And then let's take the mix here, and we're going to change this to linear light. And that way, when I drag around the factor, it will distort the texture, but it won't move it around so much. So now here on the factor, I'm going to turn this to a very small number of 0.03, so it's very subtle. But now if you look around the edges, you can see that there is some distortion. So I now want to make this more contrasty, so we're going to add a color ramp. We'll put the color ramp up here, and then I can drag the white tab over to about the middle so that it's more contrasty. And then let's make the custom colors. So to make the custom colors, I'm going to add a mix color node. We'll put this after the color ramp, and the color ramp color can go into the factor. This way, we can now change color A and B to change the two colors. So for color A, I'm going to make this the light brown, and for color B, this is going to be the very dark brown color. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, then color B will be a hex value of 0, so it's going to be fully black. So just punch in six 0s. And then here for color A, this is going to be a hex value of 80521C. Now I also want to search for a hue saturation value node, and we're going to put that between the Vorno and the color ramp, because now this value is going to control it to make it lighter or darker. So we'll be using that later in the custom node. Now let's select both of these two nodes here, and I'll press Ctrl-Shift-D to duplicate the nodes but keep the wires plugged up. And let's Ctrl-Shift and select it to preview it. And this texture here is just going to be that pattern. So I'm going to drag the white tab over here, and then also drag the black tab over here, and we'll drag this really close so it's just the pattern. And then if I drag this value on the hue saturation value, that's going to make the pattern thicker and less thick. So now I want to mix this color ramp into this mix here. So I'll select the mix and I'll duplicate it, and we're going to put this top mix into color B, and then this color ramp color, that is going to go into the factor. So now I can Ctrl-Shift and select the mix, and here on color A, I can make this that light color, so we're going to make it kind of like a light peachy color. And the hex value for color A is going to be E5BF90. So now the mix result can go into the base color, and I can Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And let's also turn the roughness up a bit, so I'll turn the roughness to a 0.75, so the shader is a bit more rough. Let's also open up the sheen settings right here, we can add some sheen. So the sheen weight I'll turn to 0.5, this is going to make it look a little bit more like cloth, so it'll look more like fur. And then for the sheen tint, I'm going to use this color here, it's kind of like an orangey-reddish color. And the hex value for this one is going to be BF6758, so you can punch that in if you want to use the same exact color I'm using. So now I just want to add some surface bump to make it look more like fuzzy fur. So I'll go to the add menu, and we're going to add a noise texture. And then let's take the original mapping here, and we'll put that into the vector of the noise texture. Let's Ctrl-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it, and I can change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to 30, and I'll turn the detail up to the max of 15, and I'll turn the roughness to a 0.79. So now I can take this factor here, the noise, and let's put it into the normal, and I'll Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now there's some weird shading issues, and that's because we need to convert the black and white data into normal data. So to do this, we're going to add a bump node. Let's put the bump node right here. And we want the factor to be going into the height value of the bump to convert to bump data. And then I'll turn the strength down to like a 0.4, so it's not quite as bumpy. So now we have that cool fur texture. So that is it for the procedural material, so I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So I'll box select all the nodes, and I'll press Ctrl-G to join it together into a node group. Now if you hit the Tab key with the node group selected, that will go in and out of the node group. So I'll drag the node group over here, let's make it bigger, and then I'll copy the material name, and I'll paste it here in the node group so it's called Giraffe Fur. So we'll go back into the node group, I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel, and if we go to the group tab, we can rename this BSDF. So I'll rename this to Shader, because I like that better. So now we have this group input, and we can plug values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures, so we can take the scale and we can put that into the group socket there, the group input, and that way this scale value will control the size of the entire material. Now I want it to be one value instead of three, you can see right here there's three values. So we'll change the type from Vector to Float, and then we need to turn the default value to 1. And then if we go outside of the node group, we need to turn the scale to 1. So we'll go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the pattern scale, so let's take the Voronoi scale and we'll put that into the group input, and I'll rename this to PatternScale. Let's also add this factor right here in the linear light, we'll put that into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to PatternDistortion. Then I want to control some detail values, so we'll take the noise texture detail, put that into the extra socket, and the roughness, put that into the extra socket. And this one I'll rename to Detail1, and the roughness I'll rename to Detail2. Then I want to control the colors, so I'll drag the group input over here. And let's first take the pattern color, this lighter one, we'll put that into the extra socket. We'll rename this to PatternColor, and then we'll take the lighter one, put that into the extra socket, and the darker one, put that into the extra socket. And I'll rename this to FurColor1 and FurColor2. Now we have this hue saturation value right here, the top one, and the value is going to make the fur lighter and darker. So I'll put the value into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to FurDarkness. Then we have this hue saturation value here, which is going to make the pattern thicker or less thick. So I'll put the value into the extra socket, and we'll rename this to PatternThickness. Then I want to control the fur scale, so we'll take the noise texture down here, I'll put the scale into the extra socket, and let's rename this to FurScale. And then I want to control all the sheen settings, so I'll drag the group input right down here. And I also want to control the bump strength, so let's actually do that first. So I'll put the bump strength into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to BumpStrength. And then for the sheen settings, we're first going to put the tint into the extra socket, so it's SheenTint. Then we'll take the sheen weight, put that into the extra socket, and the sheen roughness, put that into the extra socket. So I'll drag the node group back over here, I'll hit the N key to close the side panel, and we'll hit Tab to go out of the node group. Let's make this bigger, and we can now review the finished procedural material. So I have the scale value, we also have just the pattern scale, and the pattern distortion. Then we have two levels of detail, then we have the pattern color, and that kind of looks really cool if you make it a darker color, that looks pretty cool. And then we have the two different fur colors, so FurColor1 and FurColor2. We also have the fur darkness, then we have the pattern thickness, we also have the fur scale and the bump strength. And then we also have the sheen tint, then we have the sheen weight, and the sheen roughness. That will be it for this tutorial, so I hope you enjoyed the video, and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0rV7dhcUQE,Procedural Raw Beef Steak Material 🥩 (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural raw beefsteak material in Blender. The video details the steps to make the material look realistic by using various nodes and customization options, such as adjusting the scale, color, and texture of the fat and meat. The tutorial also covers how to integrate these into a custom node group with adjustable parameters. Additionally, the creator mentions a sale on their Blender Market products and offers links to purchase this material and others from their Gumroad store. The video concludes with information on accessing more tutorials and material packs.","In this Splendor tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural raw beefsteak material. Now I just recently posted another tutorial showing you how to make a cooked beefsteak material, so if you want to check out that video I'll have a link in the description, but in this video we'll be creating a raw beefsteak. And after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group with customizable values. So we have the scale value to change the size of the material, then we also have the large fat scale, and then also the small fat scale, then we have the meat color, so this is kind of that red color, so you can change the meat color here, and then we also have the fat color, which is kind of that whitish pinkish color. Then we have the fat distortion, so you can make it less distorted or more distorted, but I have it here at 0.5. Then we also have this fat detail, so you can actually turn this down if you wanted to make some sort of like stylized steak material, so maybe if you're making kind of like a low-poly kitchen scene or something, or a stylized low-poly scene, you can turn that down, and then you can also turn down the bump strength, and now you can see by turning down the bump strength and the fat detail, we kind of have this cool stylized raw steak material, so that's just something you can do with this material if you want to do that. And then we also have the fat detail 2, and then of course the fat detail 1, but the fat detail 2 is going to add even more detail. Then we also have the subsurface scattering, and so this is going to allow light to go through the material, and it's going to make it look more fleshy and more like food. Then we have the roughness of the material to make it more rough or shiny. Then we also have the bump strength, and then finally we have the displacement strength to pop out the mesh. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this procedural material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description. You can also check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack if you'd like to purchase all of my materials, and my Ultimate Material Pack comes with all of my materials pre-set up for Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. And you'll also get future updates with more materials, so every time I create 10 more procedural materials, I update the procedural material pack with the 10 new materials. And if you're interested in just purchasing some procedural food, then I have some procedural food packs, so you can check those out with the links in the description. And you can purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create more materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. And then real quick before we start the tutorial, I wanted to let you know that Blender Market is currently having their 2024 Summer Sale, and during the sale, all of my products on the Blender Market are 25% off. So if you've been wanting to purchase my Ultimate Material Pack or my Procedural Material Packs, or maybe some of my tutorial courses like my Sci-Fi Construction Robot tutorial series, or maybe some of my Geometry Node Modifier setups, then now is a great time to purchase because you can get 25% off during Blender Market's Summer Sale. And the sale is going on from August 20th through August 25th of 2024. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I did. So I went to the Add menu, and I just added a cube. I went to Edit Mode, and I kind of scaled the cube down, scaled it in like this. Also if I go to the Face Select, I selected this face and kind of scaled it in. Maybe scaled the whole thing down a little bit more. And then I also selected everything, and I scaled it down by 0.2. And then just make sure you press Ctrl-A and apply the scale, so that's the default size of the object. Then I pressed Ctrl-4. Ctrl-4 is going to add a subdivision surface with four levels. And I went back into Edit Mode, and I pressed Ctrl-R to add some loop cuts. And I just scrolled out my mouse wheel, added a loop cut there, added a few loop cuts there, and just made the very basic shape of the beefsteak. Then over here on the side panel, if you go to the modifiers, I clicked on the dropdown, and I applied the modifiers. So now you can see that's actual geometry. So then what I did is I went into Sculpt Mode, and if I press the T key to open up the side panel, I'll just go to the Clay Strips brush. And I just went along here, and I just started to kind of sculpt the object. And I just made a very basic beefsteak object, kind of a beefsteak shape. So I'm kind of just going along here and adding little bumps and stuff here and there, just to make it look kind of random. And then you can also hold down the Shift key as you're sculpting to smooth it out. You can also go to the Grab brush. You can use the Grab brush to kind of pull around the mesh and kind of shape it. Then you can also go to the Crease brush by clicking right here. And I'll make my brush a little bit smaller. And then you can hold down the Ctrl key, and you can click and drag. And that is going to pull out the mesh and kind of crease it. Instead of creasing it back in, it's going to crease it out and kind of pinch it. So I just creased along here and kind of creased the edge of that beefsteak. And then I'll hold down the Shift key and kind of smooth some of this out and just kind of crease the whole steak object. So once I was done sculpting, I pressed the R key to use the Remesh feature. And you can move your mouse in and out to change the size or the detail of the Remesh. And after you've gotten it to a size that you like, I think maybe that is pretty good, then you can press Ctrl R. And Ctrl R is going to Remesh it. So now if I go to Edit mode, you can see it's Remeshed it. So the detail is pretty even. And I do want lots of geometry so that the displacements can actually use the detail of the mesh to pop out the mesh. So I'll go back to Object mode. And then in Object mode, I'm just going to shade this object smooth. And so this is the final object that I'm going to be using in the tutorial. Then I also added this camera here and I just pointed the camera at the object. And if you click on the camera and then go to the Object Data Properties, I turn the focal length up to 90 just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit. And then I'll go into the Rendered Viewport mode and I'll show you the lighting. So for the lighting, I kind of wanted to add like a bit of a rim light on the back. So I added this area light and I turned the power up to about 47. And then also I went here to the World Properties and I added in this Machineshop 02 HDRI. This is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com and I'll have the link in the description. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version from Polyhaven. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on this yellow dot here next to Color and you can choose Environment Texture and then just click on the Open button and open up the HDRI. And then just a few more settings that I'll go over. If you go here to the Render Properties, I'm going to be using the Cycles rendering engine because I'm going for realism, but you could also use Eevee if you want to. And then also if you open up the Film tab right here, I checkmark the Transparent button just because I like that better so the background isn't quite as distracting, but it's still going to light the 3D scene. And also if you open up the Color Management here, I'm going to be using the View Transformer Filmic and I'll set the look to Very High Contrast. So I'm going to click over here to go to the Shading Workspace. So I'm in the Camera view right here in the 3D viewport and I'll go into the Rendered viewport mode. So then over here I have the Shader Editor. So I'll select the object and I will click on New to add a new material. And I'll just call this Raw Beefsteak. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in the video. So if you don't have that enabled, you can click on Edit, you can go to the Preferences, and then over here in the Add-ons tab, if you go to the Search, you can search for Node Wrangler and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So we're first going to start off by creating the texture group, which is going to be those large bits of fat. So I'll go to the Add menu and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's drop this here. And with the noise texture selected, I'll press Ctrl T and that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler add-on. And I want to use the object coordinates because the object coordinates are going to place the noise texture on the object more evenly. So I'll put the object into the vector and then this material will get a little bit complex. So to keep my nodes nicely organized, I'm going to be adding frames. So I'm first going to click and drag over the texture coordinate and mapping to select both of them and I'll press Ctrl J to join them together into a frame. So you can select the frame and move it around and I'm going to click on the frame and I'll press F2 to add a label and I can just call this mapping. So let's Ctrl Shift and select the noise texture to preview it and I want to change a few of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 8 and I want to turn the detail up to 15 so it is pretty detailed. And then here on the roughness, I will turn this up to like 8.6. Now I want to distort this noise texture with another texture because fat on beefsteak looks kind of random and it's kind of twisted and it looks a bit distorted. So I'm going to duplicate this noise texture and I'm going to put it here before the first one. And then I want to change a few of this noise settings. So for this one, I'm going to turn the scale to a 2.2 and then the detail I'll leave that at 15 and the roughness will turn to a 0.5. Now it's distorting it too much and I want this noise texture to have less of an effect over this noise texture. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for the mix color and we'll put it in between both of the noise textures. So now what I want to do is I want to take the noise texture factor and I'm going to put that into color B. So that's going to be the distorted one. Then this mapping here, this isn't distorted at all. And so that's going to be going into color A. So now the factor is going to blend between more distorted and less distorted. And let's click on the mix type here and we're going to change it to linear light instead. And this way, when I drag the factor, it's going to distort the texture, but it's not going to move it around quite so much. Now I'm going to leave the factor at a 0.5 because I like how much distortion that is. However, I do want to add a color to make it more contrasty because everything is really gray right now. So to make it more contrasted, I'll go to the add menu and we'll search for a color ramp and we'll put it here after the noise texture. Now, if I drag both of these tabs together, you can see it's going to be very contrasty. So I'll put this white tab kind of about here and then I'll put the black tab right about there. So that's going to be it for the large fat texture. So I'll click and drag to box select these nodes. I'll press control J to join them together into a frame just to keep the nodes nicely organized. And I'll press F2 to add a label and I'll call this large fat texture. So I now want to create another texture, which is going to be some very small bits of fat in the meat. So I'll click and drag to box like all of these nodes and I'll press control shift D. So control shift D is going to duplicate the nodes, but it's going to keep the wires plugged up. So the mapping is plugged up to the textures. Let's control shift and select this color to preview it and I can change a few of the settings. So on this noise texture here, the second noise texture, I'm going to change the scale to a 43 and then I'll leave the other settings how they are. And then this noise texture right over here, I'm also going to leave these settings how they are. So now for this color, we can change the contrast. So I want to make it less visible. So I'm going to drag the white tab kind of over here and the black tab over here. So it is less visible. So there's just a little bit of white spots here and there, and that's going to be the small bits of fat. Let's click on this frame right here and I'll press F2 to change the label. And instead of large fat texture, I'm going to call it small fat texture. So we now have the large fat texture and the small fat texture and I want to mix them both together. So if we select both of the color ramps at once, I can press control zero and that is going to add this mix color here. You can open it up and bring it over here and we're going to mix both of them together. Now I just want to add the light values. And when we're talking about the colors here, black equals zero and white equals one. So if we click on the mix type here, I can change it to the type add. So change it to add. And that was just going to add the light values and I'll turn the factor all the way up to one. So now you can see before it's just using the small one, but if I turn it up to one, it's going to add all of the light values of the large fat texture. So now we have both of them mixed together. So now I want to create the base colors because I don't just want it to be white and black. I want to make it kind of a reddish color for the meat and also a white color. So I'll go to the ad menu and we're going to search for another mix color and we'll put this after the ad. Now the result can go into the factor and that way the white and black values are going to determine what parts are going to be color a and what parts are going to be color B. So for color a, I'm going to make this kind of like a darkish red color, something like that. And for color B, this is going to be kind of a pinky orangey light color. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, then you can use the same hex values. So here on color a, this is going to be a hex value of seven, three, one, a zero E. And for color B, this will be a hex value of D C seven C seven five. So I can take the mix result and I can put that into the base color of the shader and I can control shift and select the shader to preview it. And I'll just drag the shader up here. So then I can turn the roughness down to make it more shiny, to make it look like wet meat. So I'll turn the roughness to like a 0.3 and that makes it look a bit more like raw meat. And let's also open up the subsurface here. I want to give it some subsurface to allow light to go through the meat, to make it look more like fleshy food. So on the weight here, I'm going to turn this to a 0.5 to add some subsurface. And also on the random walk here, I want to change it to random walk skin because that looks a bit better for the meat. So I now want to create a texture group, which is going to be the bump, because if you look closely at meat, it kind of has some like muscle fibers and it kind of has an interesting texture of the muscle fibers of the meat. So we're going to be creating a texture and putting that into the normal. So I'll go to the add menu and we're going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's drop it here and I'll control shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. And here on the F1 type, I'm going to change it to distance to edge instead. And then let's change the scale. So I'm going to change the scale to 150. Let's turn the detail up a little bit to like a 0.8. So it has a bit of detail. And then also let's turn the roughness to a 0.63. So then on the Voronoi, I also want to use the object coordinates. So we'll take the mapping vector. We'll put that into the vector, the Voronoi. So now I want to distort the Voronoi with another texture. So we're going to kind of do the same setup with the noise in the linear light to distort it. So I'll go to the add menu and we'll search for a noise and we'll put the noise between the mapping and the Voronoi and we'll change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to a 3.55. I think that's a pretty good size. And I'll turn the detail to the max of 15. But then I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now that's way too distorted. So to make it less distorted, we'll go to the add menu and we'll search for a mix color. We'll put this between the noise and the Voronoi. And then on the mix type here, again, we're going to choose linear light. Now we want to take the noise texture color and we're going to put that into color B. And this is the one which will be distorted. But then the mapping here, this isn't distorted at all. So we're going to put that into color A. So now the factor can blend between distorting it a lot or not distorting it at all. And I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.132. I think a 0.132 is pretty good. So I can see is just distorted a little bit and it looks more noisy. Now I also want to stretch out the meat fibers that they're going along the steak. So I'll go to the add menu and I'll search for a mapping node. We'll put this after the linear light before the Voronoi. And I can now change the scale values to kind of stretch it. So on the X value, I'm going to turn it to a 1.6. And on the scale Y, I'm going to turn it to a negative 0.3, just a negative 0.3. So now you can see it's kind of stretched back and forth along the steak. And then finally, I want to make it more contrasted. So I'll go to the add menu. We'll search for a color ramp and I'll put that after the Voronoi. And then I actually want to flip the two values. So I'll drag the white tab over here and I'll drag the black tab to about there. So it just looks more contrasted. So something like that is pretty good. So I'll box select these nodes and I will join them together into a frame. And I will add a label and I'm going to call this meat bump texture. So I can now take the color ramp color and I can put that into this normal here. So this purple one that's called normal. Let's control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. But you can see there's some really weird shading issues. It looks really dark. That's because we need to convert the color data into normal data that the shader can use. So to do this, we're going to add a bump node and we'll put the bump node between the color ramp and the normal. And we want to put the color into the height value. That's going to convert it to proper normal data. Now I actually want to click on the invert buttons because I think inverting it looks a bit better. And then it's way too strong. So let's turn the strength value to a much smaller number of 0.15. So that's much better. But now you can see it looks like those muscle fibers in the meat. So now I want to add some displacement. So let's add a noise texture for that. So I'll go to the add menu. We're going to search for a noise texture, drop it down here. And we want to take the same vector of the mapping and put that into the vector of the noise. Let's control shift and select the noise to preview it. And I'll change some of the settings. So we're just making a texture which will be a little bit bumpy around for the meat. And that'll go into the displacement. So I'll turn the scale to 4. And I'll turn the detail up to 8 so it is a bit detailed but not super detailed. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. So now what we can do is we can put the factor into the displacement of the material output. And let's control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now you can see it is kind of working. It does look like it's bumping out the mesh. But it's not actually popping out the mesh even though it looks like it has detail on the surface. So to fix this we need to go to the side panel and we need to go to the material settings and go to the settings and the surface. And on the displacement we want to change it to displacement and bump. So it's using the displacements. So we can now close the side panel. So now you can see that the object is like jutting off to the side. And that is because just like we did for the bump here, we need a node to convert the black and white data of the noise into displacement data that the material output can use. So we'll go to the add menu. We're going to add the displacement node. We'll put this here in the wire between the noise and the displacement. And I'll drag it down here. And then we want the factor to be going into the height value to convert it to displacement data. Now it's way too strong. So if I just turn the scale way down I'll turn it to a 0.02. Now you can see it is popping out of the mesh. If I just turn the scale up a little bit more you can kind of see what it's doing. So it is now displacing the mesh and that's looking great. Now if I zoom in here I want these large bits of fat to also be popping out of the mesh more. So I'm going to mix in the texture of the large bits of fat into the displacement. So to do this I'll go to the add menu. We'll search for a mix node. Actually we want to add the mix color node. So drag the mix color node right here between the noise and the displacement. We'll just drop it there. And I just want to add the light values because the light values are going to be that fat there, the bigger parts of fat. So on the mix type here I'm going to change this to add instead. Then we're going to take the noise texture factor and we're going to make sure that's going into color A. But then for color B we're going to take the large fat texture, that is this one right here, and we're going to put the color into color B. And so this way it's just going to add the light values which are the bits of fat. So if I ctrl shift and select the principled shader you can now see that where the fat is that is popping out of the mesh. So now the factor is going to add more of it or less of it. So I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.2 just so it's pretty subtle. But now where the fat is it's going to be popping out a little bit more. So we'll box select these nodes and we'll join them into a frame and I'll add a label and I'll just call this displacement. So I'll now show you how to join together into a custom node group. So we can box select all the nodes except the material output. Let's press ctrl g to join it together into a node group. And I can hit the tab key with the node group selected to go in and out of the node group. So I'll drag the node group over here. Let's drag it out to make it a little bit bigger so it looks better. Drag it there and then I can click here on the name and I can copy the material name and I can paste it here into the node group. So I'll now hit the tab key to go into the node group and I'll hit the n key to open up the side panel. Let's just open up this side panel here and if we go to the group tab we can go to the group sockets and I want to double click on the bsdf and I'll rename that to shader because I like that better. So now over here we have this group input and we can plug values up to this group input to control them outside of the node group. So this mapping scale or this mapping is plugged up to all the textures so we can use the scale value here to change the size of the entire material. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket and if I click on the scale I want to just be one value instead of three. So I'll change the type here to float instead and then I need to change the default value back to one and then I need to hit tab to go out of the node group and I need to turn the scale back to one. So we'll go back into the node. Now I also want to control just the fat scale so if I drag this up here we have the large fat scale and that's this here. So I'll put the scale under the extra socket and I'll rename it to a large fat scale and then the same thing for the small fat scale. So this noise texture here we'll put the scale into the extra socket and this one I'm going to rename to small fat scale. Then I want to control the colors so I'll drag the group input over here. Let's go over here to this mix and here's the meat color so I'll put that to the extra socket and the fat color put that into the extra socket. Double click on these to rename them and I'll rename this to meat color and then the other one this is going to be called fat color. Then I want to control the distortion of the fat so I'll drag the group input back here behind the small fat and the large fat and we have these two factors here which are going to distort it more. So let's take the factor and put that into the extra socket there and then this linear light factor we're going to put this one into the same exact socket as the other one. This way this factor is going to control both of the distortions for them at the same time and then I'll double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to fat distortion. So if I go outside of the node group this fat distortion now is distorting both of them at once because we plug them into the same socket. So we'll go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the detail of the fat and all of these four noise textures they all have a detail value of 15. So I'm going to take the detail value from all four of these and I'm going to put them all into the same exact socket so this one here and then also this one here and then I'll click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to fat detail one and then for the second layer of fat detail I'm going to use these roughness so I'll put this roughness into the extra socket and then this one here I'll put this one into the same exact socket. Let's rename this here so instead of calling it roughness I'll call it fat detail two. Then I want to control the subsurface so I'll drag the group input over here next to the shader let's take the subsurface weight and I'll put that into the extra socket and then I want to rename this I'll just rename it subsurface but you could call it subsurface scattering or whatever you want to call it and then also we'll put the roughness into the extra socket there so we can control the roughness. Then I want to control the bump strength so I'll drag this down here we can take this bump strength and put that into the extra socket and I'll rename this to bump strength and then I finally want to control the displacements so I'll drag this down here let's take the displacement scale and I can put that into the extra socket and I'll rename this to displacement strength and then one more thing that I thought would be cool to add is this add right here we have this factor and the factor is going to make the fat pop out so I'll put the factor into the extra socket here and then this one I'm going to rename to fat displacement strength. All right so I'll hit the n key to close the side panel and I'll click on the group input and I'll drag it over here at the end and I'll hit the tab key to go outside of the node group and we can now review the finished procedural material so we have the scale the material we also have the large fat scale and we have the small fat scale then we have the meat colors so we have the meat color and then also the fat color then we have the fat distortion and then we have the fat detail one and again if you want to make this look like kind of like a toon style or low poly kind of stylized raw meat you could turn the fat detail way down to a very small number maybe just change it down to maybe like a one or something like that or maybe like a two and then you could also take the bump strength you could turn that down to zero and that way we have a really cool kind of stylized meat textures that's pretty cool but I'll press ctrl z to undo that or you can hover your mouse over the values and hit the backspace and that's going to reset it to the default value that we set it as and then we have the fat detail two then we have the subsurface we also have the roughness to make it more shiny we also have the bump strength then we have the displacement strength to pop out the mesh and then we have the fat displacement strength so that's going to be it for this video so I hope you enjoyed this and thank you for watching and if you'd like to help support me and this youtube channel you can purchase this procedural material on my gumroad store in my patreon page the links are in the description you can also check out my other steak tutorial so I recently posted a cooked beef steak tutorial so if you'd like to check out that video I will have the link in the description and if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials you can check out my ultimate blender procedural material pack and to learn how to create more procedural materials definitely check out my blender procedural material tutorial playlist with the link in the description so I hope you enjoyed the video and thank you for watching"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skUprVL0IRI,Procedural Smooth Rock Material (Blender Tutorial),"This Blender tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural smooth rock material that can also resemble a stylized rock material. It covers adjusting various parameters, such as noise, wave, and Voronoi scales, and details to customize the texture. The tutorial also explains how to combine these elements into a custom node group for easier manipulation. Additionally, the video includes instructions on setting up the scene with an icosphere, using lighting and HDRI for realistic effects, and rendering settings with cycles. The creator also promotes purchasing the procedural material and an ultimate material pack from their Gumroad store and Patreon page.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural smooth rock material. And this smooth rock material kind of also looks like a stylized rock material as well, because it kind of has some little spots with smoother places, and you can also turn down the detail amount if you want to make it look more like a stylized rock. And after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node. So we first have the overall scale to change the size of the entire material, and then we have three different scale values here. So we have the noise scale, that'll just change the size of the noise texture in the material, then just the wave scale, and then also just the voronoi scale. So you can really customize the material and make it look quite different by changing these three scale values. You can make it a bit more bumpy or a bit less bumpy kind of by changing it and changing the detail. And then you can also just hover your mouse over the values and hit the backspace if you want to reset those values. Now there's also some colors here. So there's color one, and then there's also colors two. So you have two different colors to kind of change the rock. So you can make two different shades of rock. Then we have these cool distortion values. So if you turn it up more, it's kind of going to break the material that doesn't really look like rock. But if you turn it down, you can kind of get a different look. So changing that distortion value. And then there's also the second distortion value, which you can use. And I'd recommend just turning it up just by a small amount to adjust it better. Then there's also two detail values. So if you turn it all the way down, you can see it looks like a very stylized rock. And something you can do is turn the detail here, the first detail, just like a four. And I think this definitely looks like a stylized rock or a nice smooth rock, because it really doesn't have that much detail. But there are some little chunky areas and then like some smoother bits. So that looks really cool as well. Or you can leave the detail at 15. And then there's a second layer of detail here. So detail level two, you can make it look even more detailed if you want. Then there is the roughness of the material, but I have it turned up to one because I want to look very rough. Since it's a rock, it is a dry, rough rock. Then we also have the bump strength. You could turn this down and up if you want to make it look a bit more bumpy. And then we also have the displacement strength to pop out the mesh. So if you want to make it look really bumpy, you could of course bump out the displacement and make it look really chunky.

And to learn how to create more procedural materials, definitely check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. Links are in the description. So real quick, I'll show you my scene setup if you want to set up the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu and I went to mesh and I added an icosphere. And then right after I added the icosphere, if I click right behind me here on the subdivisions, after you add the icosphere, I'm going to turn up to six. So it is nice and smooth and round, and we'll have more geometry for the displacements to pop out the mesh. And I'll use the object context menu and shade it smooth. Then I'll scale this object down and I'll type in a 0.24, hit enter, press control A, and then I can apply the scale. So that's the new default size of the object. And then I'll move this over to the side. And then to add in the rock object, what I'm going to do is click here and edit, and I'll go to the user preferences. And here on the add-ons tab, I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for extra, and I'll turn on the add mesh extra objects add-on, and I'll close the user preferences. So you can now go to the add menu and you can go to mesh. And down here, you can see there are all these extra objects, but I'm going to add the rock generator. And then right behind me, or right next to me, you can click here to turn on the rock settings to see the rock settings, and you can turn off the user random seed. And then you can change the seed and just kind of find a rock shape that you like. You can also go into edit mode and you can pull around the vertices to kind of change the rock shape. And I can scale the rock down, just kind of stick it over here. And then also over here on the side panel on the modifier properties, you can turn up the subdivisions. So I like turn to the levels viewport and render up to three. And then what you can do to apply all the modifiers at once is you can click on object and you can convert, and you can just convert to mesh, and that's going to apply all the modifiers. And then also to make the geometry a little bit nicer, what I'll do is click on object mode and I'll go to sculpt mode, and then I'll hit the R key to turn on the remesh, and I'll move my mouse to kind of change the size of the remesh, and then I'll press ctrl R. So that'll remesh it, so if I go into edit mode now, you can see the geometry is quite a bit better. And then I can go back from sculpt mode back to object mode. So that's what I did to create the rock. And so here's the rock that I came up with that I'll be using in the video. Then I also added a camera, so you can just add a camera and you can just point it at the objects. And if I click over here on the object data properties of the camera, I turn the focal length up to 80 just to zoom the camera in a little bit. And then as for the lighting, if I go up here into the rendered viewport mode, I did this first area light right here kind of on the back to give a rim light, and I set the power to 300. That's the first one. And then for the second rim light, I set this to 86. And I kind of had it pointed down. And then also for this last rim light right here, this one was another background light here for a rim light, and I set the power to about 150. Now it also gets some nice realistic lighting or reflections. I went over here to the world properties, and I added in this Brick Factory 01 1K HDRI. This is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. The link will be in the description. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to color, you can choose environment texture, and then click on the open button to open up the downloaded HDRI. Now also, if you go up here to the render properties, I'm going to be using the cycles rendering engine because I'm going for realism. But you could also use Eevee if you want to. And then also, I'm going to open up the film tab right here and I'll checkmark the transparent button so that the background is transparent. And then also down here on the color management, I'll be using the view transform of filmic and the look to very high contrast to pop out the colors and make it look more saturated. So I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mood. And then right over here, I have the shader editor. So I'll select an object, I'll click on new to add a new material, and I can rename this to smooth rock. And then I'm going to click and drag here on the material dropdown and drop it onto the same rock or the other rock objects that they both have the same material. And then I'll also be using the node wrangler add on in the video. So if you don't have that, you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences. And here in the add ons tab, you can search for node and just enable the node wrangler add on in the user preferences. So I'm now going to be adding the three main nodes, the three main textures that we'll be using to create this. So I'll go to the add menu and I'll search for a noise texture. Let's drop this over here. We'll also go to the add menu and we'll search for a wave texture, drop this here, and then go to the add menu one more time. And we're going to search for a voronoi texture, drop it here. So these are the three main textures we'll use. And then I'll hold down the control and shift key and select the noise texture. And that was going to preview the node on the object. Now to use the feature of the node wrangler, you can press Ctrl T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping and make sure you do this when the noise texture is selected. So press Ctrl T, and then I want to use the object coordinates. So I'll plug the object into the vector, the mapping, and the mapping vector can go into the vector, the noise, and the object coordinates are going to place the noise texture on the object more evenly. So we can now change the settings of the textures. So for this noise texture, I'm going to turn the scale to 16. And then I'll turn the detail to 15. But I'll leave the other settings how they are. Let's Ctrl Shift and select the wave texture. And I can change some of these settings. So for the waves, I'm going to turn this to a 1.5. And then I'll turn the distortion to an 18. Also turn the detail all the way up to 15. So it's more detailed. And the detail scale, I'm going to turn to a 1.2. And then this detail roughness, I will turn to a point six. So it's even more detailed. Let's Ctrl Shift and select the Voronoi texture. And I can change these settings. So for this one, I'm going to turn the scale up to 15. But then I'll leave all the other settings how they are. So now we have three different textures here. So the noise texture is just kind of some noise. The wave texture has these really detailed waves. And then the Voronoi texture is just a bunch of little dots. So now I'm going to start to mix these together. So what I first want to do is Ctrl Shift and select the wave texture. And I want the noise texture to distort the wave texture. So it doesn't look quite like waves, but it looks more noisy. So I'm going to plug the factor into the vector of the wave. Now that's distorting it way too much. So to make it be less strong or have a less of an effect over the wave texture, I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll search for a mix color. And we'll put the mix color between the noise and the wave. Now I want to mix between the noise texture, which is making it distorted, and the mapping, which isn't distorted at all. So the factor is going to go into color B. But then this mapping vector, this is going to go into color A of the mix. Now, if I drag the factor around, you can see that it is distorting it more and less. So if it's turned to zero, it's just using the wave. But if I turn it up more, it's going to be using more of the noise, so it's really distorted. But you can see the texture is being moved around a lot. So I'm going to click on the mix type here, and I'm going to change it to linear light. And this way, you can see that it is being distorted now, but the texture isn't moving around so much. So I now want to turn this factor way down to a very small number. So I'll turn it to a 0.05. So that way, the noise is just distorting the waves just a little bit. So I can kind of compress these nodes and make it look a bit nicer. So I'm going to do the same thing for the wave and the voronoi. So the wave texture is going to distort the placement of the voronoi. So I'll select the linear light, and I'll press shift-D to duplicate it and drop it here after the wave texture. And then I can drop the voronoi after the linear light here. Now, this wave texture color should go into color B. And then we're going to take this original mapping, which isn't distorted, and we're going to put that into color A. That way, because we have color A and color B, now the factor is blending between not distorting at all and distorting it a lot. And also, let's control-shift and select the voronoi texture again until we're previewing the distance value. So I can now drag this, and you can see it's distorting it more and more. So that's making a very cool texture. And so the distortion value that I'm going to use on the factor of the linear light, I will type in 0.02. So that way, it's just distorted a little bit. So that is the main texture for the rock. So I'm now going to put the distance into the displacement to actually give it some bump. And let's control-shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And then also, just for now, to see this a little bit better, I'm going to turn the roughness up to 1. We do want the roughness to be up to 1. And then the base color, for now, I'll just make it kind of like a gray color so we can see it a bit better. Now, the displacement isn't actually working, because even though it's making it look bumpy, the edges are really smooth. So to fix this, we need to go over here to the side panel. We need to go to the material settings, and we need to go down here to the settings. So open up the settings and then the surface. And then the displacement, we want to change the bump only to displacement and bump. And this is telling the material that it can use the displacements. Now, it is bumping out now, but there's a problem, and that is that it's jutting off to the side. And that is because I need to convert the black and white data into displacement data that the shader can use. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'll search for the displacement node. And we'll drop it right here between the Voronoi and the displacement. And we want the Voronoi texture distance to be going into the height value of the displacement. So now it is working properly, but it's really sharp. So on the scale, I can just turn this way down to a 0.015, and that way it's going to be much more subtle. Now you can see we're getting a really cool rock texture. Now I want to control this a little bit better because I want some parts to be a bit more smooth. Right now it's just a little bit too chunky. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'll search for a color ramp. I will stick the color up here between the Voronoi texture and the displacement. Now if I click on the black tab and make it lighter, you can see it's going to be a little bit more smooth. And then if I take this white color and make it a little bit darker, it's going to be even more smooth. So if these values are the same exact value, it's very smooth. But if you want to make it a little bit more chunky and a little bit more sharp, you could turn that down. So you can see right here it's super smooth. The values are basically the same. But if I turn it down a bit, now it's just a little bit more sharp and a little bit noisy in some areas. And if you want to use the same exact hex values that I'm using, the first one here, this lighter one, will be a hex value of E1, E1, E1. And then the second one here, the more gray one, this is going to be a hex value of 96, 96, 96. You could also click on the white tab, and you could drag the white tab over. And that is going to kind of clamp it. It's going to make it more sharp. So now much of it looks smooth, and there's only a few parts where they're chunky and noisy. So you could do that if you wanted to. But I'm going to leave this back over here, because I do want the whole thing to be just a tiny bit noisy and have a little bit of detail. So now what I want to do is I want to take the Voronoi texture distance, and I want to put that into the base color so that some parts are darker and some parts are lighter. But then to control this better, I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll search for a color ramp. We'll put the color ramp after the Voronoi texture, but before the base color. And let's actually box select these nodes and just kind of drag them up a bit, so it's a little bit more even. So now what I can do is I can drag this black tab over to make it more contrasty. So I'll put the black tab kind of in the center. So now some parts are lighter and some parts are darker. So that'll give a bit of variation. But of course, we want to change the colors, and I want to add customizable values. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll search for a mix color, and we'll put this between the color ramp and the principled shader. Now the color can go into the factor. So now we have color A and color B, and those are going to be the two raw colors. So I'm going to make this kind of a darker gray and a lighter gray. And if you want to use the same values that I'm using, you can go to the hex value. And for the color A, you can punch in 262626. And for color B, you can punch in six threes. And then finally, I just want to give this a little bit of surface bump into the normal so that we can customize that and add a little bit more surface bump if we want to. So I'll put the Voronoi distance into the normal, but then there's going to be some weird shading issues. And that's because when you convert the black and white data into normal data. So I'll go to the Add menu, and we're going to search for a bump node, and we'll put it between the Voronoi and the principled. And then the distance value can go into the height value to convert it to bump data. And then here on the strength, I want to turn this down to like a 0.1. So it's not quite as bumpy. Of course, you can turn up more if you want to, to make it look like a bumpy rock, but I don't want to do that. I want to be nice and smooth because it's a smooth rock. So that is it for the procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So I can click and drag to box select all the nodes, and I'll press Ctrl G to join it together into a node group. Now if you hit the Tab key, you can go in and out of the node group. So I'll drag the node group over here. Let's copy the material name, and I'll paste it here in the node group. So it's called Smooth Rock. I can also drag this out to make it a bit bigger. And then I'll hit Tab to go into the node group, and I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel. And here on the group tab, I'm going to double click on the BSDF, and I'll just rename that to Shader because I like that better. So now right over here, we have this group input, and we can plug values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures, so the mapping scale will change the size of the entire material at once. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket here, and then if I click on the scale, I want to just make it one value instead of three. So on the type here, I'll change the vector to float, and that way it's just one value. But then I need to turn the default value back to one, and I also need to go out of the node group, and I want to turn the scale back to one. So let's go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the noise scale, the wave scale, and the voronoi scale. So I'll put this scale first into the extra socket, then the wave scale into the extra socket, and then the voronoi scale into the extra socket, and then I will rename these accordingly. So the first one was noise, the second one was wave, and the third one was voronoi. Then I want to control the colors, so I'll drag the group input over here, and I can take color A, put that into the extra socket, and color B, put that into the extra socket, and then I can rename these to color one and color two. Then I want to control the distortion, so if I drag the group input back here, this first linear light has this factor here to control the distortion. So I'll put the factor into the extra socket, double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename this to distortion one. And then for the second distortion, we're going to take the second linear light factor, we'll put that into the extra socket, and then the second one I'll rename to distortion two. Then I want to control the detail values, so you can see on the wave texture and the noise texture, they both have detail values of 15, so I'll put this detail into the extra socket, and then this noise texture detail, we can put this into the same exact socket. This way, the detail value here will control both of them at the same time. Now for the second detail value, we can take the voronoi detail, you can see if I turn this up and down, that's making the material look a bit different, so I'll put the detail into the extra socket there, and then I'll rename both of these to detail one and detail two. Then I want to control the roughness of the material, so I'll drag this over here to the principal shader, we can put the roughness into the extra socket. Then I want to control the bump strength, so we'll take this strength here and put that into the extra socket, and I can double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename it to bump strength. And then finally, I want to control the displacement strength, so we'll drag this down here, let's take the displacement scale, put that into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to displacement strength. So let's select the group input, and I can drag it back down here, I'll hit tab to go out of the node group, and the n key to close the side panel. And let me just make this bigger, and I'll now review the finished procedural material. So we have the scale value, then we just have the noise scale, we just have the wave scale, and we just have the voronoi scale, and then we have the two different colors, you can make the colors look a little bit different, so you can have two different variations, kind of some darker areas or lighter areas. You can also change the distortion to make it look different, and there's a second distortion value to add a lot more detail, and then there's detail value one, and then also detail value two. Then there's the roughness of the material if you want to be a little bit more shiny, then you can also change the bump strength if you want to make it look a lot more bumpy and not really be smooth, and then there is the displacement strength to actually pop out the mesh.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=467DrmlmsRE,Procedural Asteroid with Craters Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural asteroid material with craters, offering detailed guidance on constructing the material and organizing it into a custom node group with adjustable parameters. The tutorial covers controlling various aspects of the material, such as overall scale, crater size, noise scale, colors, and displacement. The video also includes instructions on setting up a 3D scene with lighting and rendering settings to achieve a realistic space-like asteroid appearance. Additionally, viewers are encouraged to purchase the procedural material or the Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack from the creator's Gumroad store or Patreon to support the channel.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural asteroid with craters material. And then after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into a custom node group so you have customizable values to control the material. So we have the overall scale, so you can change the size of the material depending on the size of your object. We also have this crater scale, so you can make a bunch of small craters, or you can make a few craters and just have some larger ones. And then we also have the crater size, and this is going to scale the size of each individual crater. So you can have a bunch of small ones, or make them a bit bigger. And then we also just have the noise scale. Then we have the different colors here, so we have color 1 and color 2, just to change the base colors. Then we also have the crater's distortion. So this will kind of distort the edges of the craters, so you probably only want to turn this up a little bit, because if you turn it up too high, it'll kind of break the shape of the craters. And then we also have this crater's depth, and so this will push the craters deeper into the asteroid. Then we have the roughness of the material. We also have this bump strength to make the surface more bumpy or less bumpy. And then we also have the displacement strength to pop out the mesh, so you can have it very smooth or make it really bumpy. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material and help support the channel, you can do that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. The links are in the description.

So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the Add menu, and I went to Mesh, and I added an Icosphere. And I wanted to add an Icosphere because I want to add an object which has lots of geometry so that the displacements have more geometry to pop out of the mesh. Now if you click right behind me, there's going to be this Add Icosphere setting, and I'm going to turn the subdivisions up to 6 so it is nice and smooth and round. And I will use the Object Context menu and shade it smooth. Then I'll scale it down to 0.2. I'll press Ctrl-A and apply the scale, so that's the default size of the object. Then I can move the object over, and I can press Shift-D to duplicate, and I'll duplicate this. And then I'll hit the Tab key to go into Edit Mode, and you can click on this button here to turn on the Proportional Editing. And then you can select some vertices. You can hit G to grab and just kind of move this around to make a cool shape for an asteroid. So here's the asteroid that I came up with by using the Proportional Editing. Now I also added a camera and some lights. So I first just added this camera, and I pointed the camera at the objects. And then if you select the camera and you click right here to go to the Object Data Properties, I turned the focal length up pretty high to about 110, just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit, because I like kind of that more flat look with a higher focal length. Now as for the lighting, if I just go into the Rendered Viewport Mode, I added a few different area lights right here. So I added this first area light. This light is kind of on the back, just to give a rim light. Then I added this light down here, and this is kind of like a slightly blue light. So you can kind of see it's giving it a bit of a blue light on the object. And then I added this light here. This is just another area light, kind of on the background for a rim light. And then finally, I added this big main light here, just as the main light on the object. Now I want the asteroid to look like it's in space. So here on the World Properties, I just deleted the world, so there is no world. And so that way, the background is just fully black. And then if you want to set the background to transparent, you can go up here to the Render Properties. You can open up the Film tab and just checkmark the Transparent button, if you want to use a transparent background, or you can also just use a black background. And then also here on the Rendering Engine, I'm going to be using Cycles, because I'm going for realism. But you can use Eevee if you want to. And the cool thing about the new Blender version, in Blender version 4.2, is that Eevee supports material displacements. So this will work great in Eevee, if you want to use it in Eevee. And then also, let's go down here and open up the Color Management. And I set the View Transform to Filmmake, and I set the Look to Very High Contrast. So I'm in the Shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here. I'll just make this a bit smaller, so we have a bit more space. And then over here, I have the Shader Editor. So I'll select the object. Let's click on New to add a new material. And I'll rename this to Asteroid with Craters. And then I will click here on the dropdown, and I'll click and drag and drop this material onto this object, so they both have the same material. And then I'll also be using some of the features of the Node Wrangler. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit. You can go to the Preferences. And here in the Add-ons tab, you can go to the Search, and you can search for Node. And just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use the Node Wrangler in the video. So we're going to start by creating the texture for the craters. And so to do that, we're going to be adding a Voronoi, because the Voronoi texture has little dots. So if I go to the Add menu, I can search for a Voronoi texture. Let's drop it here. And I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key, and then select the Voronoi. And that is going to preview the node on the object, and make sure you are in the rendered viewport mode to actually preview the material. Now with the Voronoi texture selected, I'll press Ctrl T, and that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler add-on. And it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now I want to use the object coordinates, so I'll put the object into the vector of the mapping, and the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. So now we can change some of the settings of the Voronoi. So on this F1 here, I'm going to change this to Smooth F1 instead, and that'll smooth out those edges. And then here on the scale, we'll turn this up to a 14. But then we'll leave all the settings how they are. So now I want to put the Voronoi texture into the displacement to make it pop out of the mesh. So let's put the distance value into the displacement, and I can Ctrl Shift and select the Principled Shader to preview it. And for now, let's take the base color and let's make it darker, just so we can see the material a bit better. So you can see it looks like it's kind of bumpy, but it's not actually displacing the mesh. That's because we need to go to the side panel, and we need to go to the material settings, and open up the settings, and go to Surface, and we want to change the displacement type to Displacement and Bump, and this is telling the material that it can use the displacements. So we can close this now. Now there's still some issues. You can see it's jutting off to the side, and it's really sharp. That is because we need to convert the black and white data into displacement data that the shader can use. So we'll go to the Add menu, and we're going to search for the displacement node, and we'll put it between the Voronoi and the displacement, and I'll stick this down here, and we want the Voronoi distance to go into the height value of the displacement. And then this scale here, we can turn it way down, and I'll turn it to like a 0.03, so it is much less strong. Now there's definitely a lot more things that I want to do to this. It is actually popping out of the mesh, and it looks correct, but I want to add a lot more detail, and it's kind of just lumpy right now. So one thing that I want to do is I want to add some noise to the Voronoi to make it look noisy around the craters. So let's drag the texture coordinate and mapping back, and I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll search for a noise texture, and we'll put the noise between the mapping and the Voronoi. So this is going to distort the Voronoi because the noise texture is going through the vector. And then we can change some of the noise texture settings. So here on the scale, I'm going to turn this to 20, and we can turn the detail to the max of 15, and we can leave the other settings how they are. Now this is distorting it way too much, and we can't even see the craters now. So I want the noise to have less of an effect over the Voronoi. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a mix color node. We'll put the mix between the noise texture and the Voronoi, and this mapping vector, this can go into color A, and we can drag this down, and the noise factor can go into color B. So now we can drag the factor around, and if it's turned to zero, it's not using the noise at all, but then as I turn the factor up more and more, it's slowly using more and more of color B, which is the noise. But if it's turned down to zero, it's just using color A, which is just the normal mapping. Now you can see the texture is being moved around a lot, so I'm going to click on the mix here, and I'm going to change it to linear light instead, and this way I can drag the factor, and it's distorting it, but it won't move around the texture. So that's looking really cool. You could make some really cool textures with this. However, I'm going to turn the factor to a very small number of 0.013, just a 0.013, and that way you can still see that there's some noise around the craters, but it is much more subtle. Now I also want to add a color ramp to make it more contrasty, so I'll go to the add menu, I'll search for a color ramp, and I'll stick it here after the Voronoi. Let's select these nodes and drag them back, and maybe down a bit, so I have a bit more space. And now if I drag the two tabs together, you can see that it's going to be a lot stronger and more contrasty, so I can clearly see where the craters are. So I'll drag this black tab kind of to about here, and I'll also drag the white tab over to about there. Now you can see there is a problem, and that is that there are some really flat spots, and that looks kind of weird, but we're going to be mixing this with another texture to add more noise over the material, so you don't need to worry about that right now. We're just going to focus on the shape of the craters. Now I also want another node which will control the size of the holes, so if I go to the add menu, I can search for a hue saturation value, and I'll put this between the Voronoi and the color ramp. So the hue saturation value has the value which is going to make the colors lighter and darker, and the lighter and darker values are going to make the holes really small or really big. So we'll be using this later in the custom node group. Now if I zoom in here on the edges, you can see it's quite sharp, and I want to make that a bit more smooth. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'll search for the RGB curves, and I'll put the RGB curves after the color ramp. Now if I click here in the center to add a tab, or add a little dot here, and then drag it up here into this corner, you can see that it's going to become much more smooth. So you can see how round that is, whereas before when this was dragged down here, it's like super sharp. So I'm going to drag it up a bit, kind of to about here, so that it's much more smooth. So this is definitely looking more like an asteroid with craters, but it's really smooth right now. So I'm going to be adding in another texture, and we'll be mixing that into the displacement just to add some more noise. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'll search for another Voronoi texture. We can drop it up here, and again I want to use the vector from the mapping, so I'll put that into the vector of the Voronoi, so that it's using the object coordinates. Let's control shift and select this Voronoi, and then I will change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to like an 8.7, so that the holes are smaller, and then I'll turn the detail up pretty high to like an 8, so it's more detailed, but I don't want to turn the detail quite all the way up. So now I can use this Voronoi, and this Voronoi has lots of noise because we turned up the detail, so we can mix this into the displacement. So to do that, I can click on this linear light here, I'll press shift to duplicate it, and drop it here after the RGB curves. But then this linear light here, I'm going to click on the linear light type, and I'm going to change it to darken, so it just adds the dark values. So now we can take the Voronoi texture distance, and I'm going to put that into color A, and then the RGB curves color can go into color B. So now we're mixing them together, but it's just going to add the dark values. So let's control shift and select the principled shader again, and I can now drag this factor up, and as I drag up the factor more and more, you can see that it's going to add more and more of the RGB curves here. That's color B, and that is the craters. Whereas if it's turned to zero, it's just using this Voronoi texture, so it looks pretty cool, but it doesn't really have the craters. So then as I turn up the factor, it's adding the dark values, so it's adding more and more of the craters. So I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.6. I can also hold down the shift key and right-click and drag over this wire and let go. That'll add a reroute, and I'll just drag the reroute down here just to keep my nodes nicely organized. And that way I have a little bit more space here before the shader. So now I want to just finish up the shader, so let's turn the roughness up. I'll turn the roughness up to like a 0.8 so it looks more like rock because that was a bit too shiny. We can also put the Voronoi texture distance into the base color, and that way some parts will be lighter and other parts will be darker, but then I want to have custom colors over the Voronoi. So I'll go to the add menu, and I can search for another mix color, and we'll put it between the Voronoi and the base color, and the Voronoi distance can go into the factor. So now here on color A and color B, we can make the colors for the crater. So for color A, I'll make kind of like a light gray, and for color B, I'm going to make this a much darker gray. And if you want to use the same exact hex values that I'm using to get the same exact colors, color A, if you go to the hex value, you can punch in 59, 59, 59, and color B, if you go to the hex value, you can punch in 26, 26, 26. Those are the colors that I'm using. And then I also want to add just a little bit more surface bump, so we can put the distance of the Voronoi into the normal to give it some bump, but you can see there's some weird shading issues, and that's because we need to turn the Voronoi texture into normal data so that the shader can use it. So I'll go to the add menu, and to do this, we can add a bump node. So we'll put the bump node between the distance and the normal here, the principled shader, so just stick it right there, and then we actually want the distance from the Voronoi to be going into the height value. So now I can drag the strength value, and that's going to control the bump. So I'm going to turn the strength to like a 0.22. I think that's a pretty good amount of bump. Now there's one more thing that I want to do to the material, and that is if I zoom in here, I kind of want to make some spots pop out a little bit more. So what I'm going to do is go here to the RGB curves, and I'm going to click on this dot here in the corner, which is already here, and I can drag it out, and you can see if I drag it out closer and closer, then some of the spots away from the holes, so some of the spots around the holes, they're going to be popped out more and more. So that looks a little bit better. I like just kind of popping out those spots. It just makes the material look a bit more interesting. So that is it for the procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join this together into a custom node group. So I'll click and drag to box select all the nodes, and I'll press control G to join it together into a node group. Now if I hit the tab key, that is going to go in and out of the node group. So I'll drag the node group over here. Let's drag it out to make it bigger, and I can copy the material name, and I'll paste it here into the node group. Let's hit the tab key to go into the node group, and I'll press the N key to open up the side panel, and if you click here on the group tab, I can double click on the BSDF here, and I'll just rename it to shader because I like how that looks a bit better. And then if I go over here to this side and go to the group input, we can plug values up to the group input, and then we'll be able to control those values outside of the node group. So the first thing that I want to do is control the overall size of the entire material, and this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures. So the scale value will control the size of the entire material. So let's plug the scale into the group input there, and then if I click on the scale right here, I want this to be one value instead of three values. So on the type here, I'm going to change this to float instead, and then you can see it goes away. That is because it's turned to zero. So I need to turn the default value to one, and then if I hit tab to go out of the node group, I need to turn the scale back to one. So now this will control the total scale of all the textures. So I'll hit tab to go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the crater scale. So this Voronoi texture is the craters. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket there, and I can double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename it to crater scale. Now I also want to control the crater size. So this hue saturation value, the value is going to make it lighter and darker, and that is, as you can see there, it's controlling the size of each one. So I'll put the value into the extra socket there, and this one I'll rename to crater's size, or we could call it crater's individual size, whatever makes sense for you. Then I want to control the noise scale. So that's just the noise over the surface. So this Voronoi texture here has a scale value. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket, and I'll just rename this to noise scale there on the side panel. Then I want to control the custom colors. So I'll drag the group input up here, and we can take color A, put that into the extra socket, and color B, put that into the extra socket. And you can click on them to rename them, and I'll rename this to color 1 and color 2. Then I want to control the crater's distortion. So if I go back here to this linear light, this value is distorting it more and more. So I can put the factor into the extra socket. I can click on this, and I'll rename it to crater's distortion. Then I want to control the crater's depth. So if I drag this back over here to the darken, you can see there's this factor here which is going to add more depth to the craters because it's making it darker. So I'll put the factor in the extra socket, and I'll rename this to crater's depth. Then I want to control the roughness of the material. So let's take the roughness from the shader and put that into the extra socket. And then I want to be able to control this bump strength. So we can take the bump strength here and put that into the extra socket. And right here on the side panel, let's rename this to bump strength. And then I also want to control the displacement strength. So that's controlled by the scale here. So on the displacement scale, we'll put that into the extra socket. Double-click on this to rename it, and I'll rename that to displacement scale. So I'll drag the group input back here. I can hit the N key to close the side panel, and I'll hit the Tab key to go outside of the node group. And there's the finished final material. So I'll just review the material. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the material. And then we also have the crater scale, and then just the crater size to change the individual size. Then we have the noise scale, and we have the different colors. So color 1, and we also have color 2. Then we have the crater's distortion, and also the crater's depth. Then we have the roughness to make it more rough or more shiny. Then we have the surface bump strength, and then finally the displacement strength to pop out the mesh. So that'll wrap it up for this video. So I hope you found the tutorial helpful, and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMg0nigwn7M,How to Use Blender’s Fresnel Node (Tutorial),"In this video tutorial, the presenter demonstrates how to use the Fresnel node in Blender to create various visual effects and materials, such as stylized metallic car paint and glowing edges. The tutorial covers how to manipulate the Fresnel node alongside other nodes like Mix Shader and Color Ramp to achieve different looks. The presenter explains the node's functionality in both Eevee and Cycles rendering engines and offers a free downloadable demo file with the materials used in the tutorial available through their Patreon page and Gumroad store. Additionally, they show how the Fresnel node can be used in a glass shader for more realistic effects, emphasizing its versatility in both stylized and realistic rendering.","In this video, I'll show you how to use the Fresnel node in Blender. And I'll show you how to use the Fresnel node to make some really cool effects and materials. And if you'd like to download this demo file with these cool materials using the Fresnel node, then I will have a free download link in the description. So on my Patreon page, you can just download the attached zip file on the Patreon post, and on my Gumroad store, you can just punch in zero on the price box and then download for free. Or if you'd like to help support this channel and send me a little tip, then you can throw a few dollars into the price box on Gumroad before purchasing. That's a great way to help support this channel. Now the Fresnel node will work the same in both the Cycles and Eevee rendering engines. I'll be using Eevee in this tutorial, but it'll work exactly the same in Cycles. So I have the 3D viewport right here and the shader editor right here. So I'll click on New to add a new material. So let's go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for the Fresnel node. We'll drop it here. And to preview the Fresnel node, I can plug the Fresnel factor into the surface of the material output, so now you can see what it's doing on the objects. So what the Fresnel node does is it makes the material darker when you are looking straight on at the faces, but then when you're looking at the faces at more of an angle, it makes it more of a white color. So just to show you what this is doing, I have a plane here. So if I rotate this on the Z axis, you can see if I'm looking at the plane straight on, it's really black. But then as I turn it more and more sideways, it's going to get lighter and lighter. And so you can see by adding it to this monkey head, the edges look more white, but then the center looks more black. And again, that's because we're looking at the actual faces on the front, but then over here we're looking at the faces on the side. So let's now use this Fresnel node to make a really cool stylized kind of metallic car paint-y kind of material. So I'll just click on New to add a new material. So on the base color here, I'm going to make this kind of like a lightish bluish color, and then I'll turn this metallic value to 1 so it looks like metal. And then I'll turn this roughness down to like a 0.42 so it's a little bit more reflective. And then to make it look a bit more like car paint, I can open up this coat here and I can turn up the coat weight. So this is going to add a clear coat. So it's basically going to add another layer on top, which is going to be more shiny. And then I can change the clear coat roughness if I want to. And I'll turn this roughness value to like a 0.1. So we have a pretty cool material. Now, real quick, if you do want to get that bloom effect in the viewport, what you need to do is click over here to go to the Compositing workspace and you need to click on Use Nodes. And then what you need to do is go to the Add menu and you need to search for the Glare node. And then on the Glare node settings, you need to change the type to Bloom. And then make sure you Ctrl Shift and select the Glare node to add the Viewer node. You need to plug the Viewer and the Composite both up to the Glare. So I can go back over here to the Shading workspace. And of course, make sure you're in the Rendered viewport mode. And then to preview the bloom here in the viewport, you need to scroll over here and click on the dropdown arrow in the Rendered view and make sure the Compositor type is turned to Always. And that's how you can see the bloom. So now I'm going to duplicate this material. So I'll press Shift D to duplicate this principal shader. Let's Ctrl Shift and select it to preview it. And I'm going to make this color kind of like a purpley pinkish color instead. So now we can use the Fresnel node to make a really cool effect. So I'll go to the Add menu and I can search for the Fresnel node. Let's drop the Fresnel here. And again, I'll plug the factor up to the surface just so you can see what it's doing. Now, the Fresnel does have an IOR value and this is just going to make it kind of brighter or darker. So if I turn this up, you can see it's really white. Or if I turn it down, it's going to be very sharp and you can only see the Fresnel on the edges. So I'll just leave it at the default of 1.5 for now. So what I can do is I can go to the Add menu and I can search for a Mix shader. So we can plug this top blue one to the top shader. And then this one here can go into the bottom one. And then let's Ctrl Shift and select the Mix shader to preview it. So now this factor is evenly just blending between using one of them or the other one. But where the Fresnel node comes in is we can put the Fresnel into the factor so that the edges will be one material, but then the center will be another material. So the Fresnel factor can go into the factor here of the Mix shader. And then we can drag this IOR value around just to change that. Now, it's a little bit hard to see right now. It doesn't look like it's really doing that much. If I turn it way down, now it's purple. Or if I turn it up, it's kind of more that blue color. So we can make it more contrasty by going to the Add menu. And we can search for a color ramp and put it here after the Fresnel node. So now we can make it more contrasty. So I'm actually going to flip these values. So I'll put the white tab over here. And then the black tab I'll kind of put over here. And then let me just use the default IOR value of 1.5. So if you Ctrl Shift and select the color ramp, you can see what the color ramp is doing. So without using the color ramp, you can see it's very kind of gray. But then by dragging the tabs closer and closer together, it's going to make it really contrasty. So if I Ctrl Shift and select the Mix shader here, now we have this really cool effect where there's this bluish color on the edges. But then it's more purple on the inside. You can also play around with these colors. So maybe I'll make this like a red color instead. And the purple one, I could make it like a blue color. That is pretty cool as well. So now let's make another cool material, which is going to have like some glowing edges. So what I'm going to do is delete this material. I'm just going to add another monkey head. Let's click on New here to add a new material. And for this one, I'm going to make the base color fully black. But then if I go here to the Emission, I'm going to turn the Emission Strength up. We'll just start by turning it up to a 1. And the color here, I'll just make this kind of like a yellow color. So now this is emitting light. Now the problem is that it's emitting light all over the place, but I just want it to be emitting light on the edges to get a cool glowing effect. So again, we will add a Fresnel node here in the Shader Editor. And the Factor can go into the Strength. So by putting the Fresnel into the Strength here, it's making the emission be brighter on the edges. But then when we're looking straight at the faces, it's going to be black. You can change the IOR value. So I might just turn it down a little bit so it's a little bit more contrasty. But I want to make this a bit brighter. So what I can do is go to the Add menu and I can search for a color ramp. We'll first add a color ramp. We can use the color ramp to make it more contrasty. So I might drag this over here and drag the white tab over. Something like that. You can also use this IOR value if you want to, to make it more contrasty. But I kind of like using a color ramp. It kind of gives more control. So I'll just be using that color ramp. You can see it's still not that bright. So to fix this here on this glow material, I can go to the Add menu and I can add the Math node. We'll put the Math node here after the color ramp. So then on the type here, instead of Add, we're going to change it to Multiply instead. So now if I turn up this value, it's going to multiply the values and it's going to make it brighter and brighter. So if I turn this up really big, maybe to like a 20, now it's super bright and you can see it's glowing on the edges. Or maybe even just like a 10, something like that. And then I can, of course, drag this around here to make it more contrasty or less contrasty. And then, of course, I can change the color. So maybe make it like a glowing red color. So now we have a really cool stylized glowing material. You could also turn up the metallic value to make it more metal and maybe turn the roughness down. Maybe also turn up this brightness a little bit. So now this looks like a super hot metal. Maybe they like, you know, heated up the metal. So the metal is kind of glowing. Or you can just use this to make a really cool glowing shader. Another thing you could do if you just want to be able to see the outline is let's turn off the metallic and also the base color. Let's turn this down. So what you can do to get rid of that roughness here is you can first turn the roughness up to one, but then you can open up the specular and you could turn the specular down to zero. So by turning the specular down, it's basically not going to have any reflections at all. So now it's super black except for the emission, and the emission is going to be super bright. And I could also change the color. So I could make it like a bright blue color or maybe like a pinkish color or maybe like an aqua green. Now another really cool thing you could do with the Fresnel node is you could use it when you're creating a glass shader. So this is actually a separate tutorial that I've created on how to create a realistic glass shader for Blender Eevee. If you want to check out that video, I'll have a link in the description. But what I've done to create the glass shader is I added a transparent so that the glass is actually transparent. And then I also added this principled shader here and I turned up the transmission weight and turned down the roughness. So it kind of looks like glass. But I didn't just want to add the glass because it kind of just looks like too shiny and reflective and you can't really see through the glass very well. So that's why I mixed it with a transparent. So I added the mix shader to mix between the glass shader here and the transparent so it looks more realistic and you can actually see through the glass. But what I wanted is I wanted the center to be more transparent and then kind of on the sides of the glass, I wanted to be a bit more glossy and reflective. So that is why I added the Fresnel node and I put that through a color ramp and put it through the mix shader. So this way, the center of the glass, you can kind of see through it better, but then the edges are a bit more reflective and glossy. So that is how you use the Fresnel node in Blender. It's a very cool node for creating cool stylized shading, but you can even use it to create some more realistic results. And again, you can download the free demo files if you'd like to on my Gumroad store and Patreon page. The links are in the description. So I hope you found this helpful and thank you for watching."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1GhR3HCu0Y,Procedural Diamond Marble Floor Tiles Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to craft a procedural diamond marble floor tiles material in Blender, followed by instructions on compiling it into a customizable node group. The tutorial covers adjustable attributes such as scale, roughness, diamond size, colors, tile visibility, bump strength, and rotation. The creator also promotes their Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, available on Gumroad and Patreon, which provides pre-set procedural materials for easy integration into Blender projects.","In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural diamond marble floor tiles material. And then after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group with these customizable values. So we have the scale value to change the size of the entire material. So you can change the size depending on the size of your object in your scene. You can also change the roughness value here to make the marble more rough or more shiny. And then you can just change the marble scale. And then you can also just change the individual diamond scale. So you can make some really big diamonds if you want to. That actually looks pretty cool, kind of changes the look of the material. Or you can make it really small. Then we have the base color, which is going to be this white color. But you can change it to whatever color you want. And then we also have the diamond color. So the default is black, but you could change it to another color if you want to. And then we also have the marble color, which is going to change that little marble texture. Then we have the tile visibility. So you can turn this way down if you want the tiles to be less visible or even get rid of them entirely. And then we have the diamond bump strength. And then we also just have a noise bump strength. So there's a little bit of surface noise. You can kind of see it there in the reflections. And that's going to change the bump strength of that noise. And then finally, we have this rotation value. So you can rotate this around if you want to to make it fit for your scene. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this procedural material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. The links are in the description. And if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials, then definitely check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my procedural materials pre-set up for the asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. So once you set up my Ultimate Material Pack as an asset library into Blender, you can just drag and drop the assets onto your objects to add the materials to your 3D scenes. You can also purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So real quick, I'll show you how I set up the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I did. So I went to the Add menu, and I just added a plane. And I'm just going to use the plane to preview the marble material. Then I added this area light right here. So I just went to the Add menu, went down here to Light, and added an area light. And I pointed the area light kind of down here on the plane. And if you go over here to the area light settings, I just turned the power up to 10. So if I go into the rendered viewport mode, it just kind of gives some nice lighting shining down there on the plane. And then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera down at the plane. And if you select the camera and go to the object data properties, I turned the camera's focal length up to 60. Now, I also wanted to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections. So I went here to the world properties, and I added in this AutoShop 01 1K HDRI from polyhaven.com. The link will be in the description if you want to download it. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. So what you can do here on the world properties is click on the yellow dot next to color. And you can choose environment texture. And then click on the Open button and open up the downloaded HDRI. And then I turned the strength down to 0.2 so it wasn't quite as bright. And then let's click here to go to the render properties. I'm going to scroll down here to the color management. And I set the view transform to Filmic. And I set the look to very high contrast to make the colors more saturated. So I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mode. And then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll just minimize the properties panel. I'll select the object. And I'll click on New to add a new material. And I'll just rename this material to Diamond Marble Floor Tiles. And then one more thing before we start creating the procedural setup, I'm going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit. You can go to the preferences. And then just go here to the add-ons tab. And you can go to the search. And you can search for Node Wrangler and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on. So I'll show you how to use it in the video. So let's close the user preferences. So if we go to the add menu, we're going to start by searching for a brick texture. So we'll add the brick texture right here. And then to use the feature of the Node Wrangler, you can select the brick texture and you can press Control T. And that is going to add the texture coordinate in mapping nodes. And then you can also hold down the Control and Shift key and select the brick texture. So by holding down the Control and Shift key and selecting different nodes, that's going to preview the node on the object. So let's select the brick texture so you can preview it. Now you could use the UV coordinates if you wanted to UV unwrap your object, but I'm going to be using the object coordinates. So I'll put the object into the vector of the mapping and then the mapping will go into the brick texture. So now let's change some of the brick texture settings. So to make it not look like brick and look like tile instead, I'm going to turn the offset all the way up to one. And then here on color one and color two, I'm going to make sure these are both fully white. And then we can also change the scale. So I'll change the scale to a 2.5. And then also here on the mortar size, it's way too thick. So I'm going to turn the mortar size way down to a 0.005. And then this mortar smooth here, if I just click here and drag it out to make it bigger so we can read it, I'll turn the mortar smooth all the way up to one. So now it is kind of looking more like tile, but you can see that it's not squares, it is rectangles instead. So that's because we need to make the brick width and the row height the same. So I'm going to turn this row height to a 0.5 and now we have some nice square tiles. Now I also want to keep my nodes nicely organized. So I'm going to be adding frames. So I'm going to box select these two nodes here and I can press Control J to join it together into a frame. So you can select the frame and move it around. You can also select the frame and then press F2 to add a label. And I'm going to call this mapping just to keep my nodes nicely organized. So let's drag the brick texture right up here and then I'll drag these out of the way. And right down here, I want to create the diamond group. So for the node group for the diamonds, I'll go to the add menu and we're going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's drop it here. And I can Control Shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it. And I also want to use the object coordinates. So we'll put the vector here into the vector of the Voronoi. And I can change some of the settings. So right here on the bottom setting, I'm going to change this to Manhattan instead. And now you can see it's starting to look a little bit like diamonds. And then I'll leave all of these settings how they are except the random. I want to turn the random down so that they aren't just randomly moved around, but they're going to be having a consistent pattern. So now I want to make this more contrasty. So I'll go to the add menu and I will search for a color ramp. We'll put the color ramp after the Voronoi. Now, if I drag these two tabs together, you can see they can become more contrasty. So now it looks like diamonds, but I'm going to take the linear here and I'm going to change it to constant instead. And that way it's going to be very sharp on the edges. So I'll put the black tab here and then I will drag the white tab over to about here. Now, later on in the custom node group, I want to be able to control the size of the diamonds. So if we make it lighter or darker, that'll control the size of the diamonds. So we can go to the add menu and we can search for a hue saturation value node. We can put this in between the Voronoi and the color ramp. This way, the value is going to make that texture lighter and darker. And so that is going to change the size of the diamonds. So we can use this later in the custom node group. So we'll click and drag this box, select these nodes. I'll press control J to add a frame. And if I select the frame and press F2 to add a label, I can rename it to diamonds. So now I want to mix together the brick texture and the diamonds. So we'll drag this back here and I'll go to the add menu and I'll search for a mix color node to mix two colors together. Now what we want to do is put the brick texture color into color B and then we want the color ramp here, the color of the color ramp to go into color A. And I can control shift and select the mix to preview it. So now here on the mix type here, I want to add the dark values of the texture. So I'm going to turn this to darken so it adds the dark values. So now if I turn up the factor here, you can see it's going to be more of the tiles or less of the tiles. So I'm going to turn the factor to 0.2 so you can see them, but they are pretty subtle. So just a 0.2 is pretty good. So now I want to make the custom colors. And for this, it's really easy. We can just duplicate this darken. So press shift D to duplicate, drop it here. We can change the darken type back to mix. Now the black and white values, if we put the result here into the factor, the black and white values of this texture are going to determine what are going to be color A and what parts are going to be color B. So for color A, I can make this black. You can see that's the diamonds. And then color B, this can be fully white, which will be the base color. So now we can use these colors in the custom node group later on in the tutorial. So now let's make the marble node group. So I'll go to the add menu and we're going to search for a noise texture and we'll drop it up here. And I can control shift and select the noise texture preview it. And we can change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to seven and I'll turn the detail all the way up to 15. So it's more detailed. And also this roughness, I can turn to a 0.65. So it's even more detailed. Now let's also go over here to the mapping and we can put the mapping vector into the vector of the noise texture. So it's using the object coordinates. And also I'm going to hold down the shift key and right click and drag over the wire and let go. And what that's going to do is add a reroute. So I can drag the reroute over here and that just keeps the wires more organized. So they're not overlapping. Now I want to add a lot more detail to this noise texture. So I'm actually going to select the noise texture and press shift D to duplicate and drop it here after this one. So now because the noise texture is going through the vector it's distorting the placement of the other noise texture. So now I can change some of the settings here. And the only setting that I want to change is this roughness. I want to turn it to like a 0.55 instead of a 0.65 just so there's not quite as much roughness. Cause you can see the roughness really does change how the material looks. So now we have a really cool marble texture. Now it's kind of grayed out and I want it to be more contrasty. So let's go to the add menu and we can add a color ramp and we'll put the color up here after the noise textures. And then I can drag the black tab over and drag the white tab over to make it more contrasty. So I'll put the black tab here and the white tab maybe over here. So now I have a very cool marble texture. So I'll box select these nodes and I'll join them together into a frame and I can add a label and I can just call this marble cause that's the group of the marble textures. So now what I want to do is mix in the marble with the original color. So I can take this mix node, I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here. And I want the mix result here to be going into color A. And then I want this color ramp here to be going into the factor. So again, the white and black values will be determining what will be color A and what will be color B. But I just want to add the dark values. So if I click on the mix here, I'll change it to darken and let's control shift and select the darken to preview it. So now color B here, because it's fully white, you can't see it at all cause it's set to darken, but then as I turn this down more and more, that's going to make it more dark. So for my value here on color B, if you want to use the same color I'm using, the hex value is going to be six sixes. So I'm just doing that to make it kind of like a grayish color, but if you want more visible or less visible, you can change that color there. And of course you can also change the color. You can make it more of a red color, whatever you want to do for the marble. You can also make it more contrasty by dragging the white tab and the black tab if you want to be able to see it better, but I wanted to keep it somewhat subtle. So now this darken here, this can go into the base color of the shader and I can drag this up here and I will control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And then the marble is very shiny, so I'm going to turn the roughness to 8.1 so it's pretty reflective. You can kind of see the reflections there in the HDRI lighting. So now I want to add a little bit of surface bump. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a bump node and we'll drop the bump node down here. Now the first bump that I want to add is kind of the marble and the tiles. So we can put this mixed result into the height value. And if I control shift and select it to preview it by putting the color into the height value, that's going to convert it to bump data. So now we can put this normal here into the normal and I can control shift and select the principled shader. So now if I kind of look here in the reflections, it looks kind of bumpy and I want to turn the strength to a 0.8 so it's not quite that strong. Now I do want to add a little bit of noise over the surface of the bump. So let's go to the add menu and I can search for a noise texture and I'll drop it down here. Let's maybe drag these over so we have a bit more space. And then again, I want the mapping vector here to be plugged into the vector of the noise texture so it's using the object coordinates. And let's control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And I'll change a few of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to like a 15. I'll turn the detail a little bit up to like a four so it's a little bit more detailed. So just turn that to a four. And then also the roughness here, I'll leave at 0.5. Now the lacunarity here, I'm going to turn this up to a four as well. And the lacunarity is going to add these little dots here. So you can see it kind of has a little dot pattern. So that's pretty cool. So now I want to put this into the bump as well. So if I click on this bump, I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here. So the normal can go into the normal, but now we have this extra height value that we can plug data into. So the noise texture factor can go into the height. So if I control shift and select the bump, you can see that's what it's doing. But of course that's way too strong. So on the bump strength, I'll turn that to like a 0.1. So now there's just a little bit of subtle surface bump. And then make sure the bump normal is going into the normal of the principle shader. And you can now preview the final material. So that's it for the final material, but I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group so you have more control over the material. And also one other thing you could do really quick, I'm just going to box select these three nodes. So the bumps and the noise texture, press control J to add a frame and I'll add a label and just call it bump just to keep everything nicely organized. So to make the custom node group, I'll click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output. And I'll press control G to join it together into a node group. Now, if I hit the tab key to go outside of the node group, I can drag the node group over here. Let's also click here and drag it out to make it a bit bigger. And I can also copy the material name and I can paste it here into the node group. So let's hit the tab key to go into the node group and I'll press the N key to open up the side panel. And if you go to the group tab, we have the group sockets. So here on the BSDF, I'm going to rename this to shader just because I like that better. So now we have this group input, which we can plug values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So I first want to control the overall scale of the material and the mapping is plugged up to all the textures. So the scale value will control the size of the entire material. So we'll put the scale into the extra socket. And then if I click on the scale, I don't want it to be three values. I just want one value to control the scale. So on the type here, I'm going to change it from vector to flow instead. And then on the default value, I'll turn that to one and let's hit the tab key to go outside of the node group. In the scale, I can now turn back to one. So that's controlling the overall scale. So we'll go back into the node group. Let's click on the node group and I can drag it way over here and I want to plug up the roughness value. So I'll put the roughness here into the extra socket and that's just called roughness. And then I also want to control the different scales of the textures. So let's drag this over here. And I first want to control the marble scale. So this noise texture here is controlling the marble scale. So we'll put the scale into the extra socket. I can double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to marble scale. Then I want to control the diamond scale. So I'll drag the group input down here and this Voronoi texture has a scale as well to change the size of the diamonds. However, you can see that's actually kind of messing it up. So I don't want to use the Voronoi scale because it's scaling the entire thing. I want to use the hue saturation value that we made to scale all the diamonds individually. So the value can go into the extra socket. And then if I double click on this to rename it, I'll rename this to diamond scale. Then I want to control the colors. So I'll drag the group input over here. And we first have the white one, which is the base color. So I'll put that there and I can rename this to base color. Then I want to control the diamond scale. So that's color A here, which is black. So we'll put that into the extra socket and I'll rename this to diamond scale. And then I want to control the marble scale, which is going to be this gray color here on the darken. So I'll put that into the extra socket and I'll rename this to marble color. And I totally messed that up here. The diamond scale, it needs to be diamond color, not the diamond scale. Then I want to control the tile visibility. So this darken here has a value here, this factor, which will make it more visible or less visible. So I'll put the factor into the extra socket and I'll rename this to tile visibility to control the tiles. Then I want to control the bump strengths. So we'll drag this down here. And the first one that I want to control is the tile bump strength or the diamond bump strength. So I'll put the strength into the extra socket and I'll rename this one to tile bump strength. And then this second one here is the noise. So we'll put the strength into the extra socket and I'll just rename this to noise bump strength. All right, and then finally, I want to be able to control the rotation just in case I want to be able to rotate this material. So I'll click on the group input, drag it over here. And this rotation value from the mapping, we can plug that into the extra socket to control the rotation. So I'll drag the group input back here and I'll hit the tab key to go outside of the node group and I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. And we can now review the final material. So we have the overall scale, then we just have the roughness to make it more rough or shiny. Then we have the marble scale and the diamond scale. Then we have the base color for the marble. Then we also have the diamond color and then we also have the marble color, which is that marble texture. Then we have the tile visibility so you can make it more subtle if you want. We also have the tile bump strength and the noise bump strength. And then finally, we have this rotation value so you can rotate the Z value to rotate where the texture is. So that'll be it for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed the video and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHfAxAiT1zs,Realistic Eevee Glass Shader for Blender 4.2 (Tutorial),"The video is a Blender tutorial demonstrating how to create a realistic Eevee glass shader in Blender version 4.2. The tutorial covers updates to transparency options in the new Blender version and provides step-by-step instructions for adjusting render properties, shading workspace, and material settings to achieve a glass-like appearance. It also discusses adding a solidify modifier for realism, adjusting shadows, increasing sample counts to reduce graininess, and using an HDRI environment for realistic lighting and reflections. The tutorial offers project files for free download on Gumroad and Patreon and suggests further learning resources for Blender beginners.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this realistic Eevee glass shader in Blender version 4.2. So I made a video on this a few years ago, but in the new Blender version of 4.2, there have been some updates to the transparency options in Blender Eevee, so I'm remaking this video for Blender version 4.2. And if you'd like to download this Blender file and all the project files with the Eevee glass shader, then I'll have a free download on my Gumroad store and Patreon page, the link to that is in the description. And if you're downloading on my Gumroad store, you can just punch in $0 into the price box and then download the files for free, or if you'd like to help support me, you can throw a few dollars into the tip box on Gumroad before downloading, and that's a great way to send me a little tip and help support this channel. So the first thing we want to do is go here to the render properties, and here on the render engine, we want to change this over to Blender Eevee. We're now going to click right here to go to the shading workspace, and I'll go into the rendered viewport mode, so let's select the object, I'll click on new to add a new material, and I'll just rename this to Eevee glass shader, and then I'll select the other objects, and I'm going to add the Eevee glass shader to all these other objects. Now to make this look like glass, we're going to start by opening up this transmission here on the principal shader, and we're going to turn this weight all the way up to 1 on the transmission. Now you can see it doesn't really look like glass, it's really dark, and you can't see through the glass. So there's a few things we're going to do to fix this. One thing we're going to do is take this base color here, and we're going to make it fully white, or you can change this to whatever glass color you want. And then we're also going to take this roughness value, and we're going to turn it way down to make it really shiny, because if the roughness is turned up, it's going to look like a frosted glass. Now you still can't really see through the glass, so we're going to click right here on the render properties, and we're going to checkmark this ray tracing, which is a new feature in Blender version 4.2. Now you still can't really see through the glass, so to fix this, we're going to click back here to go to the material settings, and we're going to scroll down, and you can open up the settings tab here, and under the render method, we want to checkmark this ray trace transmission. And now you can actually see through the glass. Now there's still a lot of problems with this glass. It almost looks like it's a shiny metal, and the things in the background are, like, upside down, and they're super warped. So to fix this, here on the material settings, we're going to scroll down here, and we're also going to change this thickness type from sphere to slab. And this will make it look quite a bit better, and already you can see that looks a lot more like glass. Now you can also play around with this IOR value if you want to, however, the IOR value for glass is 1.5, so I'm going to leave this at 1.5, but you can change the IOR if you want to. Now one thing that we can do to make this look much more realistic is we can add a solidify modifier to these objects. Now this object here, we don't really want to add a solidify to this object, because this is a cup, so it is hollow inside, but for these objects here, we can add a solidify to these, and that will make them look more realistic, because glass objects usually have some amount of thickness, and because you're able to see through them, you're able to see both sides. So to make that more realistic, let's click here on the modifiers tab, and on the monkey head, I'll click on add modifier, and I'm going to add a solidify modifier, let's go back to the solid view, or actually we could go into the wireframe view, so we can kind of see that, and I can just change the thickness value, and I'll just make it a very small thickness. Let's do the same thing for this sphere here, so we'll click on add modifier, we'll add a solidify modifier, right here on the solidify thickness, I can just turn this down just a little bit, so there's a little bit of thickness inside. So that will help to make it look a bit more realistic, and it may not look that different right now, but it will look different later on. Now if I look here on the side of the objects, you can't really see glass through glass, so to fix this, we are going to add in another shader. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to add a transparent shader, and we'll drop it here. Now if we plug the transparent up to the surface, it would just be completely transparent, so you can't see the objects. So I'm going to mix the transparency with this principled glass, and that way they'll be mixed together, and the glass will be more transparent. So I'll go to the add menu, and we're going to search for a mix shader, and we're going to put the mix shader here, right after the transparent. So now the transparent shader can go into the top one, and the principled BSDF, that can go into the bottom one. So now the factor is going to blend between how much it's using the transparent, and how much it's using the principled. Now instead of evenly blending between the transparent and the principled shader, I want some parts to be more transparent. Specifically, I want the middle of the mesh to be more transparent, but then I want the edges to have a bit more of the reflection from the principled shader. So to do this, I'll go to the add menu, and we're going to search for the fresnel node, and we will put this above the transparent. So if I control shift and select the fresnel to preview it, what it's doing is when you are looking at the faces on the side, they are going to be more of a white color, but when you're looking at the faces straight on, they're going to be a darker color. So the light and dark values are going to control how much it's transparent and how much it's principled. So we're going to put the factor into the factor here, and then I can control shift and select the mix shader to preview it. So now you can see the center is really transparent, but then on the sides, it's looking more reflective. And I can change the IOR value to kind of change how much of the fresnel you can see. Now I like to change this fresnel value to a 1.12, but then I also want to change the colors because it's like super transparent. It's basically fully transparent in the center. So to fix this, I'm going to bring these nodes over here, and then I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and we'll put the color ramp in between the fresnel and the mix shader. So drop it here. So now I can click on the black tab here on the color ramp, and I can make this lighter. And if I make it lighter, then we're going to be able to see more of that principled shader in the center. So now this glass shader is looking much more realistic. You can definitely notice the benefit now of adding that tiny little solidify. If I go here to the modifiers and click on this monitor icon next to the solidify to hide it, you can see now the glass looks like paper thin. It's so thin it looks like it could very easily break, and that's not really realistic. But by adding the solidify and turning up the thickness, it looks quite a bit more realistic because you can see both sides of the glass. Now there may be an issue happening for you with the shadows. If the shadows are really looking dark and not very realistic, that is because you need to click on one of the glass objects, and then click here to go to the material properties, and you can scroll down here to the settings. And you can checkmark this transparent shadows. So that's going to make the glass look much more realistic because the light is going through, so the shadows are much less visible. Now the sunlight that I'm using in this scene is very, very sharp. So if I select the sunlight, I can click here to go to the object data properties. And on the sunlight settings, there's an angle here, and I can just turn this angle up just a little bit. And that way it softens the shadow out, so that looks much more realistic instead of having those super sharp shadows. Now there is a problem with this glass shader, and that is that the glass looks really quite grainy. So to fix this, we can turn up the samples in Eevee. So let's click right here to go to the render properties, and we're going to open up the sampling. So what I'm going to do first is turn on this jittered shadows here on the viewport, and that's definitely going to make the shadows look a bit nicer. Or as you can see before, they're more grainy, and sometimes you can see kind of a bit of a pattern. So I'll turn on the jittered shadows, and that looks nicer. And then I can turn up the viewport samples and the render samples. So the higher the samples are, the longer it's going to take to render, but I'm going to turn the samples to like 500 on both the viewport and the render. So the viewport is what you're actually going to be able to see here in the viewport, but the render is what it's actually going to render as. But now if I just sit here and wait for it to load up, you can see the grain is going away because we have that high sample count. Now one more thing you can do to make this Eevee glass shader more realistic is to add an HDRI environment, and this is going to add lots of realistic lighting and reflections to reflect off the glass. So you can download lots of free HDRIs from a website called polyhaven.com. I'll have the link in the video description, and you can download some HDRIs. What I'm going to do to add in an HDRI is click here on the world properties, and then I'm going to click here on the yellow dot next to color, and I'm going to choose environment texture, and then I'm going to click on open and open up an HDRI. So I'll have a link in the description if you want to download the same HDRI, and I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version on Polyhaven, so I'll just click on open image, and then it's a little bit bright, so here I can just turn the brightness down, but this is going to make it look quite a bit more realistic because you can see there's all those reflections there on the glass, and it's reflecting all the colors and the lights from the HDRI. So that is how you create this realistic glass shader in Blender Eevee. So I hope you enjoyed the tutorial, and thank you for watching. And again, you can download the free project files on my government store and my Patreon page with the links in the description.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I66ZtpxDUiI,Procedural Moon Surface Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video is a Blender tutorial demonstrating how to create a procedural moon surface material, which is then organized into a custom node group with adjustable settings such as scale, texture, color, and displacement. The tutorial covers creating noise and voronoi textures, adding variations, and setting up a 3D scene to preview the materials. The instructor also mentions the availability of this and other procedural materials for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon, along with material packs that are regularly updated with new creations. Additionally, the tutorial encourages viewers to explore more material creation techniques through the instructor's YouTube playlist.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural moon surface material. So after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group with these customizable values. So we have the scale to change the size of the entire material. Then we also just have texture scale 1, which is going to change a noise texture, and texture scale 2, which is going to change a voronoi texture. Then we have some different colors here, so we just have color 1, which is kind of a gray color, and then color 2, which is this really dark color. And then we have this cool color brightness, so you can just kind of change this to make brighter or darker colors. Then we have this distortion value to make kind of those hills on the surface kind of distorted. And then we also have detail value 1, then we also have this detail value 2, and then we also have detail 3, and this is like a bunch of tiny little bits of detail. Then we also have this hill's height, so if you want to make those hills or bumps higher, you can, you can kind of push them up. Then we also have the roughness of the material, and then we have the bump strength, and then we finally have the displacement strength to pop out the mesh. Now as well as this moon surface material, there's also these different variations here, and these variations will be in the project files, so if you want to purchase this procedural material, then you'll also get these other variations. Now I'll show you how to do this later in the video, but if I go into the node group, the variations are going to be changed with the voronoi. So here on the voronoi, there's all these settings here, like the F2 and the distance to edge, and these other settings here. And so these settings are changed to make some different variations. So we have this moon surface chebyshev here, so you can see that looks a lot different because of the voronoi setting. We also have this one, which is smooth F1. Then we also have this one, which is the Minkowski, so that's another cool variation. Then we also have the Manhattan here, so that looks a bit different. Then we also have this distance to edge, and this one is like a really chunky one with some big hills and mountains. And then we also have the Minkowski F2, and that is a bit more of a flat one with some little cracks. So if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this procedural material, you can get that on my Gumroads store and my Patreon page. Now every time I create 10 more procedural materials, I create a Blender procedural material pack, which has the new 10 materials. So I've just released Blender procedural material pack 20, which comes with my 10 most recent materials. You can download that material pack with the link in the description if you're interested. Now I also have a product called my ultimate Blender procedural material pack, and my ultimate material pack comes with all of my procedural materials, and they're all pre-set up for Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. And every time I create another 10 procedural materials, I also update the ultimate material pack with all the new materials. So these new materials have been added to my ultimate procedural material pack, so all of my existing customers can re-download the product files to get the new updates with the new materials. And to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. The links are all in the description. So I'll now show you the 3D setup if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu, and I wanted to preview this material on a sphere, so I'm just going to add an icosphere, and then right behind me on the add icosphere settings, I'm going to turn the subdivisions up to 6 so it is nice and smooth and round, and also by turning it up to 6, the displacements will have more geometry to pop out of the mesh. And then I'll use the object context menu and shade it smooth. Then I'm going to scale this object down a bit, so I'll scale it down to a 0.31, and then I'll press control A, and I will apply the scale. And then I also went to the add menu, and I wanted to preview this on a plane to see how it would look like on a ground object, so I added a plane, and I'll go into edit mode, and then I'll use the object context menu, and I'll click on subdivide. You can also press control E, and then click on subdivide, and I'm going to continue to do that many times until it is pretty detailed, so it has lots of geometry, so the displacements have lots of geometry to pop out the mesh. And then in object mode, I'll scale this object down to a 0.45, and I'll press control A and apply the scale, and I can kind of move these objects here into the center. Then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera, and click here on the object data property of the camera, I turned the focal length to 80, just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit. Now as for the lighting, I added this area light right here, and on the area light settings here, I set the shape to rectangle, and then I changed the Y size to kind of make it longer, and I just have this pointed kind of on the side of the sphere. I also turned the power up to 40. If I go into the rendered viewport mode, it's just going to give some nice bright lighting to the side, and then I also duplicated the area light and made a bigger one. And for this one, I turned the power to 80, and kind of had it here on the side to give some light to this plane. Now also, here on the world properties, I added in this Canon HDRI, so this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, and I'll have the link in the video description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. So to add in the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to color, you can click on environment texture, and then just click on the open button and open up the HDRI. And I also turned the strength of the HDRI down to 0.6, so it's a bit less bright. And then let's go over a few of the settings. So if I go up here to the render properties, I am using the cycles rendering engine because I'm using the material displacements, and material displacements don't work in Eevee, they only work in cycles. And then also, if I open up the film tab right here, I turned on the transparent button just so the background is transparent. And also here on the color management, I turned the view transform to filmic, and the look to very high contrast. So I'm in the shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mode. And I have the shader editor right over here, so I'll just minimize the side panel. And I'll click on new to add a new material, and I can rename it to moon surface. And I can click and drag and drop the material onto this object so they both have the same material. And then I'll also be using the node wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the node wrangler enabled, you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences, and over here in the add-ons tab, if you go to the search, you can just search for node wrangler, and just enable the node wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So now we can create the material, and I'm going to start off by adding a noise texture. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'll search for a noise texture. And let's just drop it here. And with the noise texture selected, I'll press control T to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And that's using the feature of the node wrangler add-on. Now also, if I hold down the control and shift key and select different nodes, that's going to preview the node on the object. So I'll control shift and select the noise texture preview. And then I want to use the object coordinates. So we'll put the object into the vector of the mapping, and that way it'll place the texture on the object more evenly. Now I also want to keep my nodes nicely organized, because this will get a little bit complex. So I'm going to box select these nodes, and I'll press control J, and that will join them together into a frame. And if I select the frame and press F2 to add a label, I can call this mapping. So this is totally optional, I'm just using it to keep the nodes nicely organized. So now we can change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 23, and I'll turn the detail all the way up to 15. And I'll turn the roughness to 8.56, just so it's a bit more detailed. Now later on in the custom node group, I want a value which is going to make the colors lighter or darker. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'll search for a hue saturation value, and I'll put this after the noise texture. So now this value can make it lighter or darker, and we'll be using that later in the custom node group. So we'll box select these nodes, I'll press control J to add a frame, and I can select the frame, and I'll press F2 to add a label, and I can just call this noise. So the next group of textures that I want to create is the hills or the surface. So to do this, I'll start by going to the add menu, and we'll add a noise texture. We'll put this here, and the vector mapping can go into the vector of the noise texture. And let's control shift and select the noise texture preview, and I can change some of the settings. So I'll leave the scale at 5, but I'll turn the detail to the max of 15, and then the other settings I'll leave how they are. So then what I also want to do is add a voronoi texture after the noise, and we're going to have the noise distort the voronoi to give it more detail. So I'll go to the add menu, we'll search for a voronoi texture, and we'll put it after the noise texture. And now let's change some of the voronoi settings, so control shift and select the voronoi. So I'll turn the scale here to 6, but then I'm going to leave all the other settings how they are. But then what I want to do between the noise and the voronoi is go to the add menu, and we're going to search for a mix color, and we'll put this between the noise and the voronoi, and we're going to use this to have more control over how much the noise affects the voronoi. So we're going to mix the noise with the original mapping, which isn't distorted. So we'll put this vector here from the mapping into color A, and then we're going to take this noise factor, and we're going to put that into color B. Now on the mix type right here, we're going to click on this, and we're going to change it to the linear light instead. And now I can drag this factor around, and you can see that's going to distort it more or less. So I'm going to turn the factor to a .17, just a .17, so now it's more distorted and it looks more interesting. You can kind of start to see there, there's these dark areas, and there's the light areas kind of with these little crack looks, and that's what we're going to use to create the base texture. And then later on in the custom node group, I want to be able to control the height of those hills. So if we go to the add menu, we can search for a hue saturation value, and we'll put this after the voronoi. Now the hue saturation value has this value here, which makes it lighter and darker, and so later in the custom node group, the lighter and darker values are going to control how much the hills are popping up and down. And then I also want to add a color ramp just to change some of the colors. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'll search for a color ramp, we'll put this here, and the color ramp, we want to put this after the hue saturation value, and then we can change the colors. So if you want to use the same exact color, I'm going to make this tab here kind of like a light gray, and the hex value of this color is going to be 838383. So that's going to be a bit brighter, and that'll be better for when we put that into the displacement, that's a better color value. So we can box select these nodes, I'll press control J to add a frame, I can press F2 to add a label, and I can call this hills, or I can call it surface, texture, or whatever you want to call it. So now I want to mix together the noise and the hills, and that way the hills will be a bit more noisy. So to do this, I will go to the add menu, and I'll search for a mix color, and we can put the mix color here after the color ramp, and then we want this hue saturation value to be going into color B, and the color ramp color is going to go into color A. And then I can drag this factor around, and that'll just evenly blend between them, but I want to click on the mix type here, and I want to change this to the linear light. So now when I drag this, you can still see the other texture, but it kind of looks like this noise is sort of distorting it and making it more noisy. And I'll turn this to a very small number of a .127, so just a .127, so just a little bit more noise. And we can also change this later if we want to customize the material. So now I want to add the main base colors, so I'll duplicate this linear light and I'll stick it here after this one, and this one here, I'm going to change the blending mode just back to mix. And this result can go into the factor. So by putting it into the factor, the light and dark values are going to determine what parts are going to be color A and what parts are going to be color B. So now I can make the two colors, so for color A it's going to be kind of like a dark gray, and for color B it's going to be a very dark gray. And if you want to use the exact same colors I'm using, for color A the hex value is going to be 555452, and color B here, this is going to be a hex value of 191717. So now this mixed result here can go into the base color of the principled shader, and I can control shift and select the principled shader, and let's just drag these over here. So that's going to be the base color. Of course it doesn't look very interesting right now, but we're going to add some values into the normal and the displacement to give it some more bump. Let's also make the roughness, because right now it is a little bit too shiny, so I want to turn that roughness up, but I want to have a slight variation between what parts are rough and what parts are shiny. So what I'm going to do is go to the add menu and we'll search for a color ramp. I'm just going to use the color ramp to kind of change the colors so we can make it more rough or more shiny, and this color ramp color, this is going to go into the factor of the color ramp, and then the color ramp color can go into the roughness. So now we can change the colors. So if I click on the black tab here on the color ramp, if I make it lighter, you can see everything's going to be more rough, but if it's darker, things will be more shiny. So I'm going to make it kind of like a light gray, because this should be a pretty rough material. And the hex value for this light gray color here will be DEDEDE. So it's just pretty light, and so that way it looks pretty rough because it's kind of a rocky surface. But then later on in the custom node group, I want to be able to change the roughness values as a customizable value. So if we go to the add menu, we can search for another hue saturation value, and I'll put this here after the color ramp. And this has a value which I can turn up and down, and you can see that's going to make it more shiny or more rough. So we can use that later in the custom node group. So we'll box select these nodes and give them a frame, and we can add a label to the frame, and I can call this roughness, and also we can box select these nodes and add a frame just like before. Maybe I'll move this over, and we can give this a label, and I'll just call this color, we can also call it base color. Now I do want to change the colors just a little bit to make them a little bit more sharp. So what I'll do is go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a map range node, and we'll put this after the linear light, but before this mix here. So just stick it right in there. And then we can change a few of the colors here. So on the from min, I'll turn this to a 0.2, and then also let's change the from max to a 0.63, just a 0.63. And then just a couple of things I want to do to fix this, because you can see right now it's kind of lost a lot of detail, and there's just kind of these clumpy areas where it's lighter. So on the map range here, I don't want to clamp this, so I want to turn this off. And then if I go right down here to the Voronoi texture here, I do want to turn on the normalize. So by doing that, now you can see that kind of the tops of those hills there, or those cracks are a bit darker, and there's also a lot more of that noise detail, so that looks a lot better. So now to make this look much more interesting, let's add the bump and the displacement. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a bump node. We'll drop this down here. And then what I'm going to do is take this map range result, and I can put this value into the height value of the bump. If I control shift and select the bump to preview it, you can see this is what it's doing. So it's converting that black and white data into bump data. So now the normal can go into the normal of the shader, and I can control shift and select the principled shader. So you can see it looks really bumpy right now, but that's way too strong, so I'll just turn the strength down to like a 0.1. Now I want to add two more layers of bump to make it look more bumpy, so I'll press shift D to duplicate the bump, and I'm going to duplicate this bump two more times. And we're going to put the normal into the normal of this one, and the normal into the normal of this one. So we now have these two extra height values that we can plug data into. So let's take this color ramp color here, and I'm going to put this into the height value to give it more bump data. So you can see now those sharp parts there of the hills look even more bumpy because we're using that color ramp. So that's what that one is doing. And then for this one here, I want to go up here to this noise, and I'll take the hue saturation value, and I'll put that into the height value. So we have this one here, and then this one here adding even more detail, and then this one here adding even more detail. So I can control shift and select the principled shader. You can see it looks nice and bumpy now on the surface. I'll box select these nodes and join them into a frame, and I'll add a label, and I can just call this bump. Now to really make this stand out and to really make it look interesting, I'm going to add the displacement. So for the displacement, we're going to use this color ramp color here, and we can put the color into the displacement. Now if it's not looking correct and if it's not actually popping out, there's a few things that you need to do. One thing that you need to do if you go here to the side panel, you need to make sure you're using the cycles rendering engine because Eevee doesn't support the material displacements. Now what you also need to do is add the displacement node because this here is color data, but then this here is displacement data. So you can see this is a purple dot, but this over here, this is a yellow dot. So we need to convert it to the correct data. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'll search for the displacement, and we'll put this here after the color ramp. So stick it there, and I can drag this down here, and we actually want this value to be going into the height value of the displacement. So you can see it looks kind of bumpy, but it's not actually popping out the mesh. The mesh is still flat. That's because we need to go to the material settings, and we need to open up the settings, and on the displacement here, we want to change the bump only to displacement and bump so it is actually using the displacement. So now you can see it's really sharp and bumpy, so we can turn the scale down. So I'm going to turn this scale down to a 0.12 so it's less strong. You can kind of play around with this to get it the strength that you like, but now the material looks much more interesting. So that is it for the finished procedural material. Now there is something you can do which is really cool to add more variation. So on this Voronoi here, you can change the F1, so you can change this to the F2. That's kind of interesting. There's also smooth F1. There's also distance to edge, and then I don't think the end sphere radius really looks that good. That one doesn't really look that good. It actually unconnects the node. I could plug the radius here into the color. That looks a little bit interesting, but it's kind of weird and kind of too sharp on the edges. So I'm going to change this back to F1, but you can change those values there to make it more interesting. I need to put the distance again into the color. And then the other one that you can change to add more variation and to get kind of a different looking material is this bottom one here. So there's the Edalusian, there's also the Manhattan, and the Chebyshev, and also the Minkowski. So you can play around with both of these values to get some really interesting results, but I'll leave it to the top one here for now. So that's it for the procedural material, but I'll now show you how to join this together into a custom node group. So I'll click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output, and I'll press Control-G to join it together into a node group, and you can hit the Tab key to go in and out of the node group. So I'll go out of the node group, and I'll drag it over here. Let's zoom in here, drag it over, and I'm going to copy the material name, and I'll paste it here into the node group. And I'll hit the Tab key to go into the node group, and I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel, and if you go to the group here, you can double click on this VSDF, and I want to rename this to Shader, just because I like that better. So now over here on this side, you can take the group input, and you can plug values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So I'll plug the scale here from the mapping up to the extra socket here, and this scale value is plugged up to all the textures, so it'll control the size of the entire material. Now I want to click on the scale here, and I'll change the type here from Vector to Float, and that will make it one value instead of three. And then on the default value, I'll turn this to one, and then I need to go outside of the node group, and I'll turn the scale back to one. So let's go back into the node group. And then I want to control the texture scale, so I'll drag the group input down here, and we can take the noise texture scale, and I can put that into the extra socket, and also this voronoi scale, put that into the extra socket. And then here, I'll double click on them to rename them, and I'll rename this to Texture Scale 1, and then this one here is going to be Texture Scale 2. And then I want to control the colors, so I'll drag the group input right up here, and we can take this mix color here, we'll take color A, put that into the extra socket, and color B, we'll put that into the extra socket, and I'll double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename this to color 1, and then also color 2. Then I want to control the color brightness, so I'll drag the group input back here, and we have this value here which is going to make the noise lighter or darker, so I'll put the value into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to Color Brightness. Then I want to control the distortion, so if I drag this back over here, we have this linear light which is between the noise and the voronoi, and this is going to make it more or less distorted. So I'll plug the factor into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to Distortion right here. Then I want to control some detail values, so I'll drag this right down here, behind the noise, and we can take the noise texture detail, and I'll put that into the extra socket, and then I can also take this voronoi detail, we'll put that into the extra socket, and then also this roughness right here, this noise texture roughness, this is also going to make it more or less detailed, so I'll put this roughness into the extra socket, and actually this roughness value right here, I want to click and drag up and then let go to drop it up here, so we have the detail, the roughness, and the detail. So I'll double click on these to rename them, I'll rename this one to Detail 1, this one here is going to be Detail 2, and this one will be Detail 3. Then I want to control the hill's height, so this hue saturation value is going to make the texture lighter and darker, and that'll control the hill's height, so the value can go into the extra socket, and I can rename this to Hill's Height. And then I want to control the roughness of the material, so let's drag the input over here, and we have this hue saturation value that's going into the roughness, so the value will make the colors lighter or darker, which will in turn control the roughness, so I'll put the value into the extra socket, and we'll rename this to Roughness. Now I also want to control the bump strengths, and you could put all of these individually into the sockets, but just to make the node a little bit more simple, I'm going to put all of them into the same socket, because they're all the same value of 0.1. So we'll put the strength in here, and then this strength into the same socket, and this strength here into the same exact socket. And I can double click on this to rename it, and I'll call it Bump Strength, and then finally we want to add the displacement strength to control how much of the mesh is popping out, so I'll put the scale here from the displacement into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to Displacement Strength. So I'll drag the group input right back here, you can hit the N key to close the side panel, and we can hit the Tab key to go outside the node group, and we can now review the final material. So we have the scale value to change the size of the material, then we have texture scale 2 to add variation, and then we have the different colors, so colors 1 and 2, and then we have the color brightness, that'll add more variation, we also have this cool distortion value to make it look more chunky, or kind of a bit more smooth, we also have detail value 1, and we also have detail value 2, that's like some really small detail, and detail value 3. Then we have the hill's height to pop out the hills, we also have the roughness of the material, and the bump strength, and then finally the displacement strength to pop out the mesh. So that's gonna be it for this video, so I hope you enjoyed the tutorial, and thank you for watching. And you can also purchase this procedural material on my Gumroad store and Patreon page, so if you're interested I'll have the links to that in the description. And I've also made another 10 procedural materials, so I've also updated my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack with all of these 10 new materials, so all of my existing customers can re-download the product files to get the updates with the new materials. And I've also released Blender Procedural Material Pack 20, which just come with my 10 most recent materials, so if you'd like to check that out, again, the link is in the description. You can also purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store, and to learn how to create any of my materials, definitely check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on my YouTube channel. So I hope you enjoyed the video, and thank you for watching. And I'll see you in the next one. "
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEkqtZMd5o,Procedural Marble Floor Tiles Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design procedural marble floor tiles with customizable features. The tutorial covers creating the procedural material, organizing it into a custom node group for easy adjustments, and setting up different parameters such as tile scale, marble scale, noise visibility, and color options. The video also provides guidance on enhancing the material's realism using lighting and HDRI settings in Blender. Additionally, the creator mentions options for purchasing the tutorial's materials and other procedural material packs through their Gumroad store and Patreon page, offering further resources for Blender users.","In this Blender tutorial, we'll be creating this procedural marble floor tiles. So after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group so you have customizable control over the material. So we have the overall scale, so you can change the size of the material. Then we also just have the tile scale, we just have the marble scale, and just the noise scale. And then we also have the tile width and also the tile height. So if you want to change that and make kind of a different marble tiles look, you can do that. Then we have the different colors here, so we have color 1, and then we also have color 2, and then we also have color 3. And then we have the noise visibility, so there's a little bit of noise over the marble, so you can turn that up or turn it down if you want to make it more or less visible. We also have the detail size, so if you want to turn down the detail, maybe make it look like a stylized material, you could turn the detail down. And then we also have this distortion value, and that's just changing the distortion of the marble texture. Then we have the roughness of the material, so I have it set to be really shiny, but you could make it more rough if you want to. And then we also have the subsurface, because marble does allow a little bit of light to go through the material, so we have the subsurface there. And then we also have the tile bump strength to make the edges of those tiles bumpy. And then finally we have this rotation value, so you can rotate it around on the X, Y, and Z axis if you want to change the rotation for your object. And if you'd like to help support me and this YouTube channel and purchase this finished procedural material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page, the links are in the description. And if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials, definitely check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my procedural materials pre-set up in Blender's asset browser, with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. So once you set up and install my Ultimate Material Pack as an asset library in a Blender, you can just open up the asset browser in any of your projects, and you can drag and drop the procedural materials into your 3D scenes. And every time I create 10 more procedural materials, I update the material pack and add the new materials. You can also purchase my procedural material packs, which are packs of 10 materials, and you can also get any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create more procedural materials, definitely check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist. And then one more thing before we start, I wanted to let you know about my Furniture and Home Asset Pack for Blender. In this Furniture and Home 3D Model Asset Pack, you will get 250 Furniture and Home Blender 3D models, pre-set up for Blender's asset browser and ready to add to your projects. Quickly fill in your 3D scenes just by dragging the models from the asset browser into your 3D scenes. The models have been split up into five different categories in the asset browser. The categories include Office Assets, Living Room Assets, Kitchen Assets, Dining Room Assets, and a combined Bedroom and Bathroom Assets. There's also a free demo available that you can try out before purchasing. Check out the product with the links in the description, and you can also find the full product video with the link in the description. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I wanted to preview this material on a sphere and a plane. So I went to the Add menu, I went to Mesh, and I added an Icosphere. And right behind me on the Add Icosphere Settings, I just turned the subdivisions up to 6, so it is nice and smooth and round. I used the Object Context menu to shade it smooth. And then I want to model this better to the real-life scale in Blender, and the default objects are quite large. So I'll scale this object down by a 0.2, and I will press Ctrl-A and apply the scale. Then I also went to the Add menu, added a plane, because I wanted to see how this material would look on a ground object, because we're probably going to be adding it to a kitchen floor or some kind of floor object. So I'll move the plane down, and I just scaled the plane up really big and just kind of moved it over here. And then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera and click over here to go to the object data properties, I turned the focal length up to 60, just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit and make things look a bit more flat. Now, as for the lighting, I added these two different area lights right here. So this area light is kind of shining down to add some cool reflections, and I made it a slight yellow color and turned the power to 40. And then this other area light is turned to an 18, and it also has this slight yellow color. And I just kind of went into the rendered viewport mode, and I kind of moved the lights around and kind of rotated them, so that we kind of get some nice reflections. And then to make this look much more realistic, I wanted to add in an HDRI to get lots of realistic lighting and reflection. So over here on the world properties, you can go here to the color, and you can click on that yellow dot here next to color. You can choose environment texture, and then you can click on the open button and add in an HDRI. And I added in this AutoShop 01 HDRI from polyhaven.com, so the link is in the video description. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version on polyhaven.com. And then I set the strength of the HDRI to 0.5, so it's not quite as bright. Now, also, if you go up here to the render properties, I am going for realism, so I'm going to be using the Cycles rendering engine. And also here on the render properties, I'm going to scroll down, and I'm going to go to this color management, and I'm going to turn the view transform to filmic, and I'll change the look to very high contrast to pop out the colors and make everything more contrasted and saturated. So I'm going to click right over here to go to the shading workspace. So in the shading workspace, I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered viewport mode, so I can preview the material. And then I have the shader editor right over here, so I'll just select an object. Let's click on new to add a new material, and I'll just rename this material to marble floor tiles. And then I will click and drag and drop this material onto the other object so that they both have the same material. And then I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes in the video. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on edit. You can go to the preferences. And over here in the add-ons tab, you can search for Node Wrangler and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So the first thing that I want to do is create the tiles texture. So to do this, I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to add the brick texture. We'll drop it here, and I'll select the brick texture, and I'll press control T. This is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And then also, I'm going to hold down the control and shift key and select the brick texture. So when you hold down the control and shift key with the Node Wrangler enabled and then select different nodes, that is going to preview the node on the object. So control shift and select the brick texture. And then I want to use the object coordinates, so I'll plug the object into the vector. You could also use the UV if you wanted to, if you wanted to UV and wrap the objects, but I'll just be using the object coordinates. Now, I want to keep my nodes nicely organized because this material will get a little bit complex. So to make it easier to understand and to not get so confused with all the nodes, I'm going to click and drag to box select these two nodes here, and I'll press control J. Control J is going to join them into a frame, so I can drag the frame around. I can also press F2 with the frame selected, and that's going to add a label, and I can just rename this to mapping. So it's totally optional, but I like to do this to keep the nodes nicely organized. So now we're going to use this brick texture to create the tiles on the floor. So the first thing that I want to do is turn this offset to one so that it doesn't look like brick, but it actually looks like tiles. And then let's go down here to the bottom, and on the brick width and the row height, I want to change these both to 0.5 so that they are the same size. And then let's change a few of the settings. So let me just go right here, and I can click and drag to make this bigger. And then on this mortar smooth, I'm going to turn this to a 0.87 so that you can see the little black lines there are a bit more smooth. And then also this mortar size here, I want to make it more thin. So I'll turn this to a 0.002. That way those lines there are very, very thin. And then I'll turn the scale to a 4. Now you can see there's a little bit of variation with the tile colors, and that's because of these different colors here. So the mortar and then color 1 and color 2. I'm going to make color 2 fully black, and also the mortar here, I'm going to make fully black. And then color 1, I'm going to leave how it is. So if I zoom out here, you can see there's going to be a little bit of variation. So some are lighter and some are darker. And we're going to use that to kind of add a little bit of variation to the colors later on in the video. So what I now want to do is create a noise texture because I want to add a little bit of noise into the material later on. So let's go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's drop this up here. And I can Control-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And we can change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to 8. I'm also going to make it very detailed, so we'll turn the detail to the max of 15. And I'll turn the roughness all the way up to 1, so it's super detailed. Now, what I want to do is I want to make it so that this noise is randomized, so the location is random per tile. Because if we mix the noise texture with the brick, then the noise would just seamlessly move along each tile, but each tile has been placed in a separate position, and so I want the noise to look different per tile. So what we're going to do is use this brick texture and put it into the vector, and that's going to randomly move the placement of the noise per tile. So to do this, I need to go to the Add menu, and I need to search for a mapping node. And we'll put the mapping node behind the brick. Now, we're going to take the brick texture color, and we're going to put that into the location. And let's Control-Shift and select the mapping to preview it. And then I want to use the object coordinates, so what we're also going to do is we're going to take this mapping here, which is using the object, and we're going to put that into the vector. And this way, later on in the custom node group, we can use this mapping scale and rotation to change the rotation and scale of the entire material. So we now have this mapping here, and this mapping is randomly going to give different values. So we can put this mapping into the noise, and the noise will be generated at different positions because this brick texture, the color is going into the location. And so the lighter colors and darker colors of the brick texture are randomly going to change the position. So we're going to take the mapping vector, and we're going to put that into the vector of the noise. And I can Control-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So it is a little bit hard to see, but if you zoom in here, you can see that there are kind of some seams there where the different tiles are. Now let's box select these two nodes. I'll press Control-J to join it into a frame, and I'll press F2 to add a label, and I'm going to call it tile mapping. All right, so now for this noise, I want to make it more contrasty so you can see it better. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll search for a color ramp. That's not the right node, a color ramp, and we'll put that after the noise texture. And to make it more contrasty, we can drag the black tab and the white tabs together. So if there's more black, it'll be darker. If there's more white, it's going to be lighter. But if I push them really close together, there's going to be lots of black and white, so it's super contrasty. So I'm going to drag them to about here. Now I also want to make the light color a little bit of a gray color. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click on the color and go to the hex value, and you can change it to AC, AC, AC. So now it's just kind of a bit gray, so you can see the noise a lot better. Now there is one more thing that I want to do to this noise, and that is that I want to be able to control the visibility of it later in the custom node group. So if we make the values lighter or darker, that'll control the visibility. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for the hue saturation value, and we're going to put this after the color ramp. So now we have a value here, and if I drag this, that's going to make it lighter or darker. And you'll see how this affects the material later, but this will be used in the custom node group to make the noise more visible or less visible. So let's box select these nodes. I'll press Ctrl J to add a frame. We'll click on the frame, press F2 to add a label, and I'm going to call this noise texture. So let's click on the principled shader, and drag this over here, and drag the material output out of the way. And right here under the noise texture, we're going to create the base marble texture. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a wave texture. Let's drop it here. And then we want to use the same mapping here. We don't want to use this mapping. We want to use the tile mapping, because that way, just like with the noise, it's going to randomly place the texture at different locations per tile. So we'll put the vector into the vector of the wave, and I'll Ctrl Shift and select the wave to preview it. So just to show you, if I were to take the mapping vector and put that into the vector, it would use the object coordinates, so that's fine, but you can see that it doesn't have that tile look. But if I put the vector here from this mapping into the vector, now you can actually see the tiles, and it's placed differently per tile. So that's going to add a cool effect. So let's change some of the settings of the wave texture. So I'll turn the scale to three. I'll turn the distortion to 20, and let's turn the detail to the max of 15. Now, I want to make this much more detailed, so we're actually going to put a noise texture in front of the wave, and the wave is going to distort the noise. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll search for a noise texture, and we're going to put the noise texture in front of the wave. So this way, the wave texture is going through the vector, so it's distorting the noise texture. So let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I'll turn the scale to two. I'll turn the detail to 15. I'll also turn the roughness up a little bit to like a 0.55, so it's a little bit more detailed, and I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now, I want to change how the wave texture is affecting the noise texture. So what I'm going to do is go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a mix color node, and we're going to put the mix color node in between the wave and the noise. Now, on the mix type here, I'm going to change this to the linear light instead. So I want the wave texture color to be going into color A, and this mapping here from the tile mapping is going to go into color B. So now this factor here, I can drag the factor, and that's going to change how it looks. So you can really change this depending on how you want it to look. You could also put this later into the custom node group to control it. I'm just going to turn the factor all the way up to one. So now what I want to do is pretty much do the same thing over here, but with a Voronoi. So this group of textures is going to be distorting a Voronoi texture. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. We can drop it here after the noise, and you can Control-Shift and select the distance value to preview it. And now let's change some of the settings. So I'll change the F1 here to distance to edge, and then let's turn the scale to six. I'll make it very detailed, so I'll turn the detail to 15, and I'll turn the roughness up to like a 0.55. And I'm going to turn this lacunarity value to five as well. So now I'm going to take this linear light, and I'll duplicate it, and I'll stick it here in between the noise and the Voronoi. And we actually want to unplug the noise, and we're instead going to take the color, and we're going to put the color into the factor of the linear light. And then we want to take this original mapping here, so the mapping vector, and we're going to put that into color B. So now we can take color A, and we can make it lighter and darker. You can see it's basically going to move the texture around. And I'm just going to make it fully white. So that is going to be it for the base marble. So I'll box select these nodes, press control J to add a frame, and we can add a label, and I can rename it to marble texture. All right, so let's click and drag these nodes and move them over, because now right here I want to add the base colors. We can also drag out this noise texture here, drag out these to kind of make it the same size. So to add the base colors, I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a mix color. We can actually put the mix color right here in the wire after the Voronoi. Now the Voronoi texture here, this is going to go into the factor. And this way, by putting it into the factor, the light and dark values of this texture are going to determine what parts are going to be color A and what parts are going to be color B. So now let's make the two colors. So for color B, I'm going to make this kind of a light peachy color. And for color A, this is going to be kind of like a brown color. And if you want to use the same exact colors I'm using, for color A, the hex value is going to be 735442. And for color B, the hex value is going to be FFE6C8. So that is the base color of the marble. Of course, you can make any different marble color that you want, but I like kind of having it this light brown color. So now what I want to do is mix in the noise. So let me just drag this principled shader back here, and I'll select the mix, and I'll press shift to duplicate it and drop it up here. Now this mix result, this is going to go into color A. And then to mix in the noise, we're going to put the hue saturation value color into the factor. So now that's going to mix in the noise. And on the mix type here, we can change it to darken, so it'll add the dark values. And now here in color B, if we make this darker, that is going to add the dark values of the noise. So you can see this noise texture here. If I just like drag this around, drag the color and colors, you can kind of see what it's doing. So there's the noise. And so just the dark values of the noise are being mixed in here. So now for color B, you can make this whatever color you want for the noise. So I'm going to go with a dark brown color, and the hex value for this color is going to be 2B 0F 00. So now I also want to mix in one more texture here into the base color. And what it's going to do is it's going to make the inside of the tiles look a little bit darker. So I'll select this darken. I'll press shift to duplicate it and drop it here after this one. And then what I want to do is go over here to this brick texture, and I'm going to take the brick texture color, and I'll pull out a wire and I'll drag this all the way over here. And I'm going to stick it into the factor of this dark. Now I want to change how that texture looks because you can see right now, it's making the inside of the tiles look a bit lighter. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to add a color ramp. I'll put the color ramp here in the wire before it goes into the factor. And let's just drag this up here. So what I first want to do is flip the colors. So I'll drag the white tab over here and then I'll drag the black tab kind of to about here. And then for this white color, I'm going to make this a gray color and the hex value I'll be using for this mid gray color will be 9F 9F 9F. So now if I zoom in here, you can see the inside of the tiles are looking a bit darker. Whereas before if I control shift and select the darken, you can see it's not there. So here is the base marble, then here is the added noise, and then here is the darkened edges there in the tiles. So we'll box select these nodes. I'll join them together into a frame and I can add a label and I can just call this like base color. So I can now take this darkened result here and I can put this into the base color of the shader and I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And let's zoom out here and we definitely want to make this more shiny because it doesn't really look that much like marble. So let's take the roughness value on the principled shader and I'll turn this to a 0.05. So now it's looking much more like a shiny marble material. And then also let's open up the subsurface here because marble does allow a little bit of light to go through the material. So on the subsurface weight, I'll just turn this to a 0.5 so there's a little bit of the subsurface scattering. Now the last thing that I want to do to this material is I want to add a little bit of bump right there in between the tiles so that in between the tiles it kind of bumps in. So to do this, I'll go to the add menu and I want to search for a bump node and we'll drop the bump node right down here. And then I want to go back over here to this brick texture and I'm going to take the brick texture color and I'm going to plug this here into the height value so it's converting the color data into bump data. So now the bump normal can go into the normal of the principled shader. And then if I drag the strength here, you can see that's controlling the bump but now you can see it looks like in between the tiles there, it's just bumping in. So that is it for the finished procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join this together into a custom node group. So I'll click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output and I'll press Ctrl G. Ctrl G will join it together into a node group. Now if I press the tab key with the node group selected that's going to go in and out of the node group. So I'll drag the node group right over here and let's zoom in here and just drag it out so it's a bit bigger so you can see it better. And then here, I'm going to click up here and copy the material name and I will paste it here into the node group. So let's hit the tab key to go into the node group and I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel. And here on the interface, I want to double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to shader instead. So we can now add up all the custom values. So if we go here to the group input, we can drag the group input down here and if we plug values up to the group input we can control them outside the node group. So I first want to control the overall scale of the entire material and this mapping is plugged up to all the textures. So this scale value will control the size of the entire material. So we'll put the scale into the extra socket. Let's click on the scale and I want to make it one value instead of three values. So we'll turn the type here from vector to float instead and then we need to turn the default value to one and we'll go outside of the node group and then we need to turn the scale back to one. So that's controlling the overall size. So we'll go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the tile scale. So we can take the brick texture scale and we'll put that into the extra socket. Double click on this to rename it to change the name and I can rename it to tile scale. Then I want to control the marble scale. So we'll drag the group input way over here and this Voronoi texture here, it has a scale value and we can drag this around to change the scale. So we'll put the scale into the extra socket. Let's double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to marble scale. And then I want to control the noise scale. So we'll put the group input right up here and we can take the noise texture scale and put that into the extra socket and we can rename this to noise scale. And then I want to control the tile width and height. So we'll bring the group input back here and we can put the brick width into the extra socket and the row height into the extra socket. And I'll double click on these to rename them and I'll rename this to tile width and also tile height. Then I want to control the colors. So we'll drag the group input way over here next to the base colors and we can put color A into the extra socket and color B into the extra socket. And then these two are the same exact color so you could put them in separately but I'm going to put B into the extra socket and then I'll put this color B into the same exact socket. And this way this one color will change both of them. And then I'll rename all these colors 1, colors 2, and colors 3. Then I want to control the noise visibility. So I'll drag the group input back here and we have this hue saturation value and we can drag the value to make the noise more or less visible because it's making it lighter or darker. So I'll put the value into the extra socket here and I'll rename this to noise visibility. Then I want to control the detail. So I'll drag the group input back here and on all of these textures we can put the detail values into the same socket. And you can see all the details are set to the same value of 15. So I'll put the detail into the extra socket and this one here into the detail, this one here into the detail, and this one here, the Voronoi, the last one here into the detail. So just those four, so that's going to control all the detail of all the textures. Then I want to control the distortion. So there's this wave texture distortion value so you can see that's distorting the marble. So I'll put the distortion in the extra socket. You could also put many more of these values into the extra sockets if you want to like this linear light factor to change the look of it, also the detail roughness here and also the roughness of the noise and the roughness here of the Voronoi. You could also turn this up and down to kind of get more variation so you can really do whatever you want to customize the material but I'm not going to be adding in those values. Let's also add in the roughness. So I'll drag the group input right over here and we can take the roughness. We can put that into the extra socket and let's also take the subsurface weight. We'll put that into the extra socket and you could rename this to subsurface weight or subsurface scattering. I'm just going to call it subsurface and then let's also plug the bump strength into the extra socket and I'll double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to tiles bump strength and then the last thing that I want to do is add the rotation in case I want to rotate the material. So I'll select the group input and I'll drag it right here at the very end of the node setup and I want to take this mapping here and I want to take the rotation and put that into the extra socket because this mapping is plugged up to all the textures. So I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. I'll hit the Tab key to go outside the node group and you can see now there's the rotation. So I'll press Ctrl S to save and this will finish it up for the material so I'll just review the final material. So we have the overall size of the entire material. I can also just change the tile scale. I can just change the marble scale and I can just change the noise scale and then if I want to I can also change just the tile width or also just the tile type to customize that and then we have the different colors. So we have colors 1 through 3 and then we have the noise visibility so you can have more noise or less noise. We also have the detail value. So if you turn this down it almost looks like a stylized material kind of like a stylized marble. Then we have this distortion value if you want to change that. We also have the roughness of the surface. Then we have the subsurface and then the tile bump strength and then finally we have a rotation so the rotation X, the rotation Y, and the rotation Z if you want to change the rotation on your object. So that'll be it for this video. So I hope you found the tutorial helpful and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4ADroTHMZg,Procedural Rough Sand Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural rough sand material and subsequently organize it into a custom node group for easy customization. The tutorial covers adjusting various parameters such as the overall scale, rock scale, and individual rock size, as well as customizing colors for rocks and sand. The tutorial also includes tips on setting up the 3D viewport, lighting, and using the Cycles rendering engine for material displacement. Additionally, the creator offers the material for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon and promotes their Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack and other resources for further learning.","In this blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural rough sand material. So after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into a custom node group so you can customize the look of the material. So we have the overall scale, so you can change the entire size of the material depending on the size of your object. Then we also just have the rock scale if you want to make those rocks bigger or smaller. And then we have a rock individual size, so this is going to make the individual rocks bigger or smaller, so you can see it looks really chunky now, or you can keep the rocks quite small. Then we have a few different colors, so we have the rock color, so you could make really dark rocks if you want to. I like them looking a bit more subtle. And then we have a few colors for the sand, so we have this sand color 1, which is the main color of the sand. And then we also have sand color 2, and this is a secondary color for the sand. Then we also have the detail value, so this is the detail value of like all the textures, so you can make it less detailed if you want to. And then we have this roughness here, so because this is a really rough sand, I want it to look very dry and rough, so I turn the roughness way up, but you could turn it down and make it more shiny if you want to. Then we also have the sand bump strength 1, and this is some larger bump. Then we have bump strength 2, which is kind of some smaller bump. And then we have the rocks bump. And then finally we have the displacement strength to actually pop out the mesh. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this procedural material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description. And you can also purchase my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack if you'd like to get access to all of my procedural materials. And my Ultimate Procedural Material Pack also comes with future updates, so when I create more materials, I update the Ultimate Procedural Material Pack. You can also purchase my procedural material packs, which are packs of 10 materials, and you can also purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube to learn how to create any of my procedural materials. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu and I added an icosphere. And right behind me on the add icosphere settings, I turned up the subdivisions to 6, so it is nice and smooth and round, and I shaded it smooth. And that way it has lots of geometry, so it can use the displacements, because the displacements uses the geometry of the mesh to pop out the displacements. I also scaled the object down by 0.2 so it is a better size, pressed ctrl a and I applied the scale. Then I also went to the add menu and I added a plane, because I wanted to preview this on a plane. And I brought the plane down, kind of scaled it down, and moved it back a little bit. And I went to edit mode, and you can press ctrl e, and you can choose subdivide. And then click right here right behind me on the subdivide settings, and you can just turn up the subdivide settings, maybe turn up to like a 30 or something, maybe even like a 40, so it is more detailed, so the displacements can make it all bumpy. Then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And over here on the output properties, I made the resolution 1080 by 1080, and then a 200 percent, so it is a square image. And also right over here on the render properties, it's really important that you use the cycles rendering engine if you want to use the material displacements, because the material displacements won't work in Eevee. So make sure you're using cycles. So I'm going to go up into the rendered viewport mode to show you the lighting. So I added a few different lights. So I added this area light right here. And for this area light, I set the power to 250, and I changed the shape to rectangle, so that it's kind of long. And then I also duplicated that light, and I made a much bigger one. This one, the power was set to 300, and it was kind of like an orangey color. And then this one is a rectangle shape as well. And then also, I went over here to the world properties, and I added in this abandoned workshop HDRI from polyhaven.com. The link will be in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1k version and the HDR version. So to add in the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot next to color. You can choose environment texture, and then just click on the open button to open up the downloaded HDRI. And then if you go right over here to the render properties, we are using cycles. And then also let's scroll down here and open up the film tab, and you can check mark the transparent button if you want to make the background transparent, so it's not as distracting and you can't see it. And then also, if you want to open up the color management here, I changed the view transform to filmic, and I set the look to very high contrast to make the colors more contrasted and saturated. So I went over to the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered viewport mode. And I have the shader editor right over here. So we'll select the object, and we'll add a new material. And I can just rename this material to rough sand. And then I can click and drag and drop this material on the other object, so they both have the same rough sand material. Now I'll also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences, and over here on the add-ons tab, you can go to the search, you can search for the Node Wrangler, and just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So what I first want to do is make the first sand texture. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a noise texture, and we can drop it here. And then with any texture selected, you can hold down the ctrl and shift key, and then select that node. And that is going to preview the node on the object by just ctrl shift and selecting the different nodes. Now also with the noise texture selected, I'll press ctrl t, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I want to use the object coordinates, because the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. So we'll put the object into the vector. And then we can box select these two nodes here. And I want to keep my nodes really nicely organized, so it's easy to understand. So if we box select these nodes, I can press ctrl j to join them together into a frame. And you can click on the frame and move it around, and that will move around all the nodes in the frame. And if you select the frame, you can press f2 to add a label, and I can just call this mapping. So this is totally optional, but I just like to do it to keep the nodes nicely organized. So now let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 15. And then let's also turn the detail to the max of 15, so it's really detailed. And I'll turn the roughness up to 0.6, that'll make it even more detailed. And I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now I want to make it look like sand, so I need to add some colors. And I want the colors to be customizable. So to do this, I can go to the Add menu, and I can search for a mix color. I'll put this here after the noise. Now the noise texture factor can go into the factor of the mix. And this way, the factor is determining what parts will be color A and what parts will be color B. So the black and white values will be color A and B. So for color A here, I can make this the main base color of the sand. So it's going to be kind of like a dark brownish, or a little bit more towards the orange. And then color B, this is going to be a very dark brown. And if you want to use the exact same colors that I'm using, you can use the same hex values. So for color A, this will be a hex value of 684217. And then color B, this is going to be a hex value of 280700. So let's box select these nodes. I'll press Ctrl J to add a frame. You can select the frame, press F2 to add a label, and I can just call this sand. So let's now make the group of textures for the rocks. So I'll go to the Add menu, and we'll search for a Voronoi texture. Drop this up here. And again, I want to use the object coordinates. So the vector of the mapping can go into the vector of the Voronoi. And let's Ctrl Shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. And I can change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to a really big number of 135. And you can see now we have these little dots here, so it looks like rocks. And the detail here, I'll turn to 2, so the rocks are a little bit more detailed, and they kind of have a random shape. And then the roughness, I'll leave at 0.5. And then the lackinarity here, this is going to make some little dots, but I don't really want that. So I'll turn it down a little bit. So I'll turn this to a 1.7 instead of a 2. So there's a little bit less of the lackinarity. Now, these dots here are going to be where the rocks are. But later on, when we create the custom node group, I want to be able to change the individual rock size. So if we make it darker, that'll be able to see the rocks better, so it'll make the rocks look larger. So if I go to the Add menu, I can search for a hue saturation value, and I'll put this after the Voronoi. Now, the value here, if I drag this, it'll make it darker or lighter. So when we put this in the custom node group, by turning this down and making the rocks darker, they're going to look bigger. So we'll use that later in the custom node group. Now, I want the rocks to look much more sharp, because it's not really clear where the rocks are. It's kind of gray. So I'll go to the Add menu, and we'll just add a color ramp. We'll put the color ramp here after the hue saturation value. And then I can make it very contrasty by dragging both of these tabs together. So I'll drag the black tab to about here, and I'll drag the white tab really close to about there. So now you can see we have this rock texture, but this value here is still going to make the rocks bigger or smaller. So we'll use that in the custom node group to change the size of the rocks. Now, I'm also going to put this rock texture into the bump, just to give it some surface bump. However, if we put this into the bump, it's going to look really sharp, and I'll show you later what that's going to do. But I don't want to look that sharp, because I want the rocks to look round. So on the top here, they're going to be at the highest point, and they're going to go down on the sides. So I want to use the same texture, but I don't want it to be as sharp. So we'll select the color ramp, and I'll press CTRL-SHIFT-D to duplicate the node, but keep the wire plugged up. And I can CTRL-SHIFT and select the color ramp. Now, I want to take this black tab here, and I want to drag it back, but the white tab is going to stay exactly where it is. So it is a bit hard to see, but this way the darkest point there is in the center, and then it will be a gradient, and it will slowly get lighter and lighter. So I'll show you later what that does when we put it into the bump, but that'll make the rocks look more bumpy, and they're not going to be super sharp. So let's box select these nodes. I'll join them into a frame, and I can add a label, and I can just call this rocks, because these are the textures that made the rock. Let's just drag this over here. I can put the noise back, and maybe drag the mix over. We can also box select these and kind of move them over here. All right, so the next thing that I want to do is join the rocks and the sand together, and we'll be putting that into the base color. So what I can do is select the color ramp, hold down the SHIFT key, and select this mix color here, which has the main colors, and I'll press CTRL 0. So CTRL 0 is going to add this mix node here. We can drag this up here, and the color ramp color, this is going to go into the factor to determine what parts will be color A and what parts will be color B, and then this sand color, this is the base color of the sand, that is going to go into color B. So now color A here, this can be the color of the rocks. So you can see basically the rocks are on top of the sand texture, and if you want to use the same exact hex value that I'm using for the rock color, then you can use a hex value of 47290C. And you can make it a darker color if you want to, but I find if the rocks are too dark, they just kind of stand out too much, so I like just kind of a subtle brown color. So we can put the result into the base color, and let's CTRL SHIFT and select the principled shader to preview it. I can zoom out here, so that's going to be the base color of the texture. Now you can see it looks a little bit reflective and a little bit shiny, and it will look more rough when we add the normal and the displacement, but I do want to make this a very rough sand. So here on the roughness, I'm going to turn this to a 0.9, so it's super dry and rough. So this material is very smooth, and so I want to give it some normal, so we're going to put some textures into the normal here to give it some bump. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for another noise texture, and let's drop the noise texture right down here. And then we want to use the same mapping, so we're using the object coordinates. So we'll put the vector into the vector of the noise texture, and let's CTRL SHIFT and select it to preview it, and we'll change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to 50, and I'll turn the detail to the max of 15, and I'll turn the roughness to a 0.7, so it's very detailed, and I'll leave the other settings how they are. So I want to put this into the normal, but if I just put the factor and just stick it into the normal, and then CTRL SHIFT and select the principled shader, you can see there's going to be some weird shading issues. That is because this is black and white data, but this here is normal data. So to convert it to normal data, you can go to the add menu, and we can search for the bump node. We'll put this between the wire between the principled shader and the normal, and I'll just stick it down here. Now the factor needs to be going into the height value, and that will convert it to bump data, so it looks nice and bumpy now. But it's way too strong, so here on the strength value, I'll just turn it down to like a 0.1. Now I'm going to select these nodes and bring them down a bit, and I also want to add another texture into this bump. So I'll drag them up over here. I'll press SHIFT to duplicate it and put another bump right up here above it, and then what we're going to do is use this noise texture. So we're going to put the factor into the height value of this bump, and then this bump normal can go into the normal of this bump. So that way, we first are using this noise texture. If I CTRL SHIFT and select it, this is going to be some larger bump, but then we have this other bump here, and I can CTRL SHIFT and select this one to preview it, and that's going to be some smaller bump. So you can kind of see what they're doing by dragging the strength values. And then I also want to add another bump, and this is going to be for the rocks. So we'll duplicate the bump again. We can put it down here, and the normal can go into the normal because this one has already converted to bump data, so the normal can go through the normal, but we now have another height value that we can add data into. So what we're going to do is take this color ramp here, and we're going to put that into the bump. Now I mentioned this earlier, but I don't want to use this color ramp because if I put this color ramp here, if I put this into the height value, I can CTRL SHIFT and select the bump to preview it, and let's turn the strength up so it's a lot bigger or it's a lot stronger. You can see if I zoom in here, it doesn't really look like rocks. It just looks really flat. It kind of looks like some water droplets, but that's not what I want because it's super flat, and that is because it's too contrasty. So instead, we're going to use this one here, and this one has a nice gray gradient. So we're going to put the color into the height value instead on this one, and if I CTRL SHIFT and select it, you can see now it actually looks like these little bumps here. Now they look like they're going back in, so I'm going to click on the invert so they look like they're popping out. So now it looks like there's these little round rocks or little pebbles. So the normal can go into the normal here, and I can CTRL SHIFT and select the principled shader to preview it. So now it looks like little rocks over the surface. Now it is too strong, so I'm going to turn the strength value of this bump to just like a 0.3 so it is more subtle. All right, so I can drag this bump down here. Let's box select these nodes. We'll join them together into a frame, and I'll select the frame and press F2 to add a label, and I can just call this bump because these are all the bump nodes. So it's starting to look like a rough sand material, but it still looks kind of boring, and it doesn't really look that realistic because it actually isn't being displaced. So it looks really smooth. So let's add some displacement. So for this, I'm going to be adding one more texture. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'll search for another Voronoi texture. Let's drop this here, and then we want the same mapping vector to be going into the vector of the Voronoi, and then I can CTRL SHIFT and select the Voronoi to preview it. Now this line here where this wire is overlapping, so what I'll do is hold down the shift key and right click and drag over the wire and let go, and that is going to add this little dot here which is called a reroute, and I can drag the reroute over here. And again, this is just to keep the nodes nicely organized, but it doesn't actually affect the look of the material. But that way it goes down here, and then the wire goes over. All right, so let's CTRL SHIFT and select the Voronoi texture twice. So if you're not selecting it, just hold down the CTRL and SHIFT key and then click on it twice because we want to preview the color. And now let's change the Voronoi settings. So on the F1 here, I'm going to change this to smooth F1 instead, and then I'll turn the scale to a 10 so it is smaller. And also let's make it pretty detailed, so I'll turn the detail to 15, and I'll turn the roughness to like 8.6. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. So we're going to use this texture, and we're going to put this into the displacement. But if we put the color data up to the displacement, the displacement is also a purple dot. So what we need to do is convert the color data or the black and white data into displacement data. So we'll go to the add menu, and we're going to search for the displacement node, and we'll put this here after the Voronoi. Now you can see that the color is going into the normal, but we actually don't want that, so we're going to unplug it from the normal, and we're going to stick it into the height value instead. And then I can drag the displacement down here, and then we want this displacement to be going into the displacement of the material output. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader. So now you can see it does look really bumpy, but if you look on the sides here, it's not actually displacing the mesh. Now if it isn't displacing the mesh for you, there's just a few things that you need to go over to make sure it works. So if you open up the side panel here, I mentioned this at the beginning of the tutorial, but make sure that you're using the Cycles rendering engine, because Eevee doesn't support displacements. And then also go here to the material settings, and we want to scroll down, and we want to go here to the settings, and we want to go to the surface displacement. And instead of it being bump only, we want to change it to displacement and bump. And this is telling the material to use the displacements. So you can see it looks really bumpy right now, but it's way too strong. So let's go back down here to the displacement, and on this scale value, we can just turn this down to make it less strong. So I'm going to go with a displacement scale of a 0.01. So if I go into the camera view, look here on the side, you can see it looks much more realistic, because it's all bumpy. So that makes the material really look a lot nicer. So we can box select these nodes, we can join them into a frame, and we can add a label, and we can call this displacement. And that is it for the procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So we want to box select all the nodes except the material output, and I'll press Ctrl G to join it together into a node group. And then you can hit the tab key with the node group selected to go in and out of the node group. So I'll go out of the node group, and I'll drag it over here. Let's also make it a bit bigger, so we can see the custom values. And I will copy the material name and paste it here in the node group. So it's called rough sand. So let's select the node, and I'll hit the tab key to go into the node group, and I'll press the N key to open the side panel, and click here on the group tab. And here on the BSDF, I'll double click on this, and I'll rename it to shader, because I like that better. Now if you go over here to this side, you can see there's a group input, and we can plug values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So I first want to control the overall scale, and this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures. So that way, this scale value will change the size of the entire material. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket here. And then if you click on the scale here, you can see it's going to be three values, but I just want it to be one value. So on the type here, we're going to change it to float instead, so it is one value. And then on the default value, I'll turn this to one. And then let's hit tab to go out of the node group, and we'll turn the scale back to one, so you can actually see the texture. But now that'll control the size of the material. So let's go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the rock scale, so we'll drag the group input right up here. And this Voronoi texture has the scale value, so I'll put the scale under the extra socket, double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename it to rock scale. Now I also want to control the rock individual size, not the whole scale of the texture, but the individual size. So if I turn the value down on the hue saturation value, that's going to make the rocks look bigger. So I'll put the value into the extra socket and double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename it to rock individual size. And then I want to control the rock color, so I can drag the group input right over here, and we can take color A here from this mix and put that into the extra socket, and I can rename this to rock color. And then for the sand color, we can put color A here from this mix into the extra socket and color B, put that into the extra socket. Let's drag this back over here, and I'll rename this to sand color one, and then rename this one to sand color two. Now I also want to add some detail values, and if you look right here at this noise texture and this texture and this Voronoi, they all have detail values of 15. Now I don't want to include this one here, because this one has a detail value, but that's kind of messing up how the rocks look, so I'm not going to include this one. But we're going to take all the details from the other ones here, and we're going to put them into the same socket. So this detail, put that into this socket, we'll drag this down here, and we're going to put this detail into the same exact socket, so not a new one, but the same socket, and then drag this over here, and this detail is going to go into the same socket. That way, outside of the node group, this detail value will control all of those textures at once. So I'll go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the roughness, so we'll drag this up here, and we can put this roughness value into the extra socket, and then I also want to add the bump strengths, so I'll drag the group input right down here, and we'll take this first one here, and we'll put the strength value into the extra socket, and then the second one here, this is also sand, so we'll put this one, you can put it into the same socket if you want to, but I'm going to put it into a separate socket, and then let's rename these. So I'll rename this one to sand bump strength one, and then if I copy this and paste it here, I'll rename this to sand bump strength two, and this one is kind of a larger one, and this one is kind of a smaller one, and then also this one here, this is the rocks, so we'll put the strength into the extra socket here, and this one I'll rename to rocks bump strength, and then the last one that I want to add is the displacement strength, so let's drag this over here, and we'll put the scale into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to displacement strength. Alright, I'll drag the group input right back over here, and I can hit the N key to close the side panel, and I'll hit the tab key to go outside of the node group, and we can now review the final material. So we have the overall scale, and then we just have the rock scale, so you can change that rock texture, then we have the rock individual size, so you can turn it down if you want the rocks to be bigger, and then we have the rock color, so you can make it darker or lighter, and then we also have the sand colors one and two, so you could make it more of like a yellow sand, or more of like a red sand, if you want to look more like a desert, like a hot desert sand, or more of like a beach sand, it could be more like a white color or a yellow color. And then we have the detail value, if you want to make it less detailed, we also have the roughness, if you want it to look maybe a bit more wet, and then we also have the sand bump strength, this is a larger bump strength, and then the second one here is a smaller bump strength. Then we have the rocks bump strength, so you can make the rocks really bumpy if you want to, and then finally we have the displacement strength to pop out the mesh.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mLwPaE5Adc,Procedural Chunky Concrete Material (Blender Tutorial),"In the Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural chunky concrete material. The video covers creating the material, organizing it into a custom node group for customizable values, and details various adjustable parameters like scale, detail, color, chunk height, and roughness. The tutorial also explains setting up the 3D viewport and lighting in Blender to showcase the material. Furthermore, the creator promotes their Gumroad store and Patreon page, offering the material and other procedural material packs for purchase and provides links to additional tutorials and resources.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural chunky concrete material. And then after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group so that you have customizable values. So we have this scale here, so you can change the size of the material depending on the size of your object. Then we also have this detail value, so you can make it less detailed. And if you make it less detailed, it almost looks like a stylized material. Then we just have the chunks detail, so you can make the chunks less detailed. You can kind of see they're more sharp on the edges or more detailed. And then we also have the noise detail, so you can make it really, really tiny detailed, or you can make it less detailed there. And then we have the different colors, so we just have color one, and then we also have color two. Then we have the chunks height, so I can bring the chunks down or kind of bring them up depending on the height that I want. So if I turn the chunks height the way up, you can see there's just a few little chunks here and there, or I can turn it down and have it very chunky. And then we also have the chunk scale. And then we have the noise scale as well. Then we have the roughness of the material, so you can make it really rough or really shiny. And if you make it really shiny, it almost looks like a chunk of metal. And then we have the bump strength to change the surface bump. And then we also have the displacement strength to pop out the mesh. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description.

So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu and I just added an icosphere. And right behind me on the add icosphere settings, I turned the subdivisions up to six. So it is nice and smooth and round, and I'll shade it this smooth. And also if I go into edit mode, you can see there's lots of geometry. And I want lots of geometry because we're going to be using the material displacements. So the materials displacements need lots of detailed geometry to actually displace the mesh. Now in object mode, I'm going to scale this object down by like a 0.2. And then I'll press control A and apply the scale because the default objects in Blender are quite large. So I want to make them a bit smaller. I'm going to move this sphere over here. And then I'll also go to the add menu. And I thought it would be cool to add the material onto a cube. So I'll add a cube and I'll scale the cube way down. And I can move the cube over and I can just kind of rotate the cube over like this. Let's go into edit mode. And I'm going to press control E with everything selected in edit mode, and I'm going to click on subdivide. And right behind me, you can see there's the subdivide settings. And I'm going to turn this up really big, maybe turn up to like a 20, or maybe even like a 30. And then I'll use the object context menu and shade it smooth. Now also, I'm going to press control two, and control two is going to add a subdivision surface modifier with two levels on the object. And I'm doing that because we're going to be using the material displacements. So I want lots of geometry for the material displacements to actually pop out of the mesh. And then scale this down, you can press control A and just apply the scale. Then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera and go to the object data properties of the camera, I turned the focal length up to 80 just to kind of zoom the camera in a little bit. Now as for the lighting, I added these different area lights right here. So this area light is kind of on the front, but more to the side, and I turned the power to 70. Then we have these two backlights here. So these are both turned up to 250. And these are kind of an orangey color, just to give some cool lighting. And then also to get some cool lighting and reflections, I added in this HDRI here. So I added in this Bloomberg Sunrise 2 1K HDRI. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. So I'll have the link in the video description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm going to be using. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to color, you can choose environment texture, and then click on the open button and just open up the HDRI. Now let's also go up here to the render properties. And it's really important that you use the cycles rendering engine because the material displacements will not work in Eevee. So make sure that you're using cycles. And then also open up the film tab and I'm going to turn on the transparent button just so that the background is transparent. So it's still going to light the scene, but it's not quite as distracting. And then also right down here, I'm going to go to the color management and I'm going to turn the view transform to filmic and I'll change the look to very high contrast. So I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3d viewport right over here and I'll go into the rendered mode. I'm just going to select one of the objects and then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll click on new to add a new material. I'm going to drag and drop this material onto both objects so they have the same material. And I'll rename this material the chunky concrete. Now I'm also going to be using the node wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So you can click on edit and you can go to the preferences. And over here on the add-ons tab, you can click on the search and you can search for node and just enable the node wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So what I'm first going to do is go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a voronoi texture. And I'll also go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And these are going to be the two base textures. Now because we turned on the node wrangler add-on, you can hold down the control and shift key and then select different nodes. And that's going to preview the node on the object. Now with the voronoi texture selected, I'll press control T and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I want to use the object coordinates because the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. So let's put the object into the vector. And then I want the object coordinates to be on both of these textures. So we're also going to put the vector to the vector of this one here. So now let's change some of the voronoi settings. So I'll click on the F1 here and I'll change this to the distance to edge instead. And that way we're going to get those cool chunks there. And then we'll change the scale to a 7. Let's turn the detail to 15 so it's very detailed. And the roughness I'll turn up to like a 0.54. And then this lackinarity I'll turn up to 5. And this is going to add even smaller chunks in the larger chunks. And then I'll leave the random at 1. Let's control shift and select this noise texture and I can change these settings as well. So I'll turn the scale to a 12. Also turn the detail to 15 so it's really detailed. And I'll leave the other settings how they are. So let's control shift and select the voronoi texture again and I want to change the colors. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a color ramp and we'll put the color ramp after the voronoi. So now I can drag the white tab and I can also drag the black tab. Let's just drag the white tab kind of over here and then drag the black tab kind of over here. So you can see as I drag this over it's just starting to make those little black areas pop out. And then this white color here I'm just going to turn this a little bit down so it's kind of like a light gray. And the light gray color that I'm going to be using if you go here to the hex value you can punch in a hex value of BABABA if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using. And I'll drag this a little bit back and drag the black tab over a little bit more. So now I can see it's white with some little black chunks. Now later on in the tutorial when we create the custom node group I want to be able to control the height of those chunks. So I'll go to the add menu and I'll search for a hue saturation value and we'll put this after the color ramp. Now the hue saturation value has the value and the value is going to make it lighter and darker and so when we actually control this in the custom node group that's going to change the height because it's controlling the colors. So we'll be using that later. So I now want to mix the two textures together so the Voronoi and the noise. So what I'll do is select the noise texture and then I'll hold down the shift key and select the hue saturation value. And I can press control zero. Control zero is going to add this mix node. So I'll drag this up here and on the mix type I want to change this to darken instead. Now the noise texture I want that to be going into color A and then this hue saturation value color that is going to go into the factor. So now we have this set to darken here on the type and on color B I can make this fully black. So by making it fully black you can see that there is the Voronoi texture you can see there's kind of those chunks there but then there's also some parts where it's pretty noisy. So we're mixing those two textures together. Now after the darken I want to change the colors even more. So I'll go to the add menu I'll search for another color ramp and we'll put this after the darken and I can just use this to edit the colors further. So let's make the black tab kind of over here so it's a little bit darker then I'll drag the white over so it's a bit more contrasty to about there and then I'll hold down the control key and click to add another tab. We can drag this tab around you can see if I drag it over here or drag it back you can kind of see those chunks better. So let's just drag it to about here but then I want to make it kind of a light color so it's more subtle and the hex value of this light gray color is going to be a hex value of db db db. So let's just zoom out here and this is going to be the base of our texture. So if we box select all these nodes we can press ctrl j just to join them together into a frame. This is totally optional you don't have to do it but I like to join them into a frame just to keep my nodes nicely organized and if you click on the frame and press f2 you can add a label and I'm going to call this like base texture because this is the main texture and then if we box select these nodes you can press ctrl j to add a frame you can press f2 to add a label and I'm going to rename this to mapping. Again totally optional but I just like to keep my nodes really nicely organized so they're easier to understand. All right so let's drag the principled shader back here and the material output and I now want to create the base colors. So I'll go to the add menu and we can add another mix color. Let's drop the mix color here after the color ramp and I want to put the color ramp color into the factor so now the white and black values are going into the factor so they're going to determine what parts are going to be color a and what parts are going to be color b. Now the mix result can go into the base color but let's now change the colors for the mix. So here in color a I'm going to make this fully black and then here in color b I just want to make this a dark gray color and if you want to use the same exact hex values the black color is fully black so the hex values will just be six zeros but then color b here if you go to the hex value this is going to be 282828. So let's ctrl shift and select the principled shader we can drag this back here let's drag this up and if I select this mix I'll press ctrl j to join it together into a frame I'll press f2 to add a label and I can just rename this to base color. We're also going to be adding another mix color later to mix in another texture so that's why I'm adding the frame there. So let's now create that other group of textures so we're going to add another noise texture so I'll go to the add menu we'll search for a noise texture let's just drop it down here and then I want to use the same texture coordinate and mapping so that we're using the object coordinates so let's put the vector into the vector of the noise texture and I'll ctrl shift and select the noise texture preview it and we can change some of the settings so I'll turn the scale to 40 because I want to be pretty detailed we'll turn the detail to the max of 15 and I'll turn the roughness up to like 8.6. Now I also want to make this more contrasty so I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a color ramp and we'll put the color up here after the noise texture so now I can drag the white tab and black tab around and I'm actually going to flip the values so I'll put the white tab kind of over here and the black tab I'll put that kind of out there so it's pretty contrasty so I can select these nodes I can join them into a frame and I can add a label and I'm just going to call this noise. So now I want to take this noise and I want to put it into the base color because if I ctrl shift and select this mix here you can see it's kind of subtle and there isn't too much detail so I want to add this noise texture into the base color to make some parts lighter and darker and just add more detail so I'll select the mix color I'll press shift d to duplicate it and we can drop it down here and make sure the result is going to the base color so now this mix here this is going to go into color a and then this noise texture color ramp this is going to go into the factor and then color b here this is going to be fully black so if I ctrl shift and select the mix here you can see it's going to be darker and actually what I want to do is just add the dark values from the noise so if we click on this mix here we can change it to darken so now I can ctrl shift and select the mix and ctrl shift and select the darken you can see the difference so there's just lots more detail and some little dark areas here and there and so make sure the darken result is going into the base color and I can ctrl shift and select the principled shader to preview it now still not looking really like concrete right now and that's because it doesn't really have any bump so we're going to be adding the bump as well but first I want to add the roughness because it's definitely too shiny so I'm going to take this color amp color and I'm going to plug that into the roughness so that there's some variation between some parts being more rough and other parts being more shiny but I want to control how rough and shiny it is so I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a color ramp and we'll put the color in the wire between the color ramp and the principled shader just drop it there and then we can change the colors of the color ramp to make it lighter or darker so if it's lighter it's going to be more rough and if it's darker it's going to be more shiny so on this black tab here I'm going to make this a light gray color and the hex value is going to be six nines now later on in the custom node group I want to be able to control the roughness values so if we control the light and dark values that'll control the roughness so let's go to the add menu we can search for a hue saturation value and put this after the color ramp and so now we have the value here which is going to make it lighter and darker so that'll make it look more rough or more shiny so you can box select these nodes you can join them into a frame you can select the frame and you can add a label and I'm just going to call this roughness again just to keep things nicely organized so now I want to add this noise texture into the normal to give it some bump so let's take the color ramp color from this noise group we're going to put that into the roughness but then to fix the weird shading issues we need to convert the color data into normal data that the shader can use so I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a bump node and we'll put the bump node between the color ramp and the normal and we want the color ramp color to be going into height value so it converts it to bump data so then here on the strength I can just turn this to a 0.15 so it is much more subtle so the last thing that I want to do is add the displacement so it actually looks really bumpy and interesting because right now it kind of looks like concrete but it's just not really that interesting and it's not bumpy so what I want to do is take this base texture we're going to take this color ramp color and we're going to put this into the displacement but then we need to convert it to displacement data just like we did for the bump node we converted the color data into bump data so we need to convert the color into displacement data so we'll go to the add menu and we're going to search for a displacement node and we'll put the displacement here in the wire so drop it there and then drag it down and then we actually want this color ramp color to be going into the height value so now it looks really bumpy but if you look on the edges it's not actually displacing the mesh that is because we need to open up the side panel here and we need to go to the material settings and on the displacement here instead of it being bump only we need to change it to displacement and bump so that it's using the displacements and if you don't see this setting that is probably because you're using blender ev so make sure you're using the cycles rendering engine so that you can use the material displacements all right so I'll make the side panel smaller and you can see it's way too strong so I can change the scale here to make it more strong or less strong so I'm going to go with a scale value of like a 0.04 so now you can see all those chunks there are popping out of the mesh but it's not too strong and that is it for the procedural material so let's now join it together into a custom node group so we have more control over customizing the material so I'll click and drag and box select all the nodes except the material output and I'll press ctrl g to join it together into a node group now if you hit the tab key you can go in and out of the node group with the node group selected so I'll hit tab to go out of the node group I'll drag the node group over here next to the material output and I can drag it out to make it bigger and then I will copy the material name and paste it here in the node group now if you hit tab to go into the node group you can hit the n key to open up the side panel you can click on the group tab and then here on the bsdf I want to rename this to shader just because I like that better so outside of the node group you can see it says shader so let's go back into the node group and right over here if you go over here to this group input we can plug values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group so this mapping is plugged up to all the textures and so the mapping scale is going to change the size of the entire material so let's put the scale into the socket there and then if I click on the scale you can see it's three values but I instead want it to be one value so we'll click on the type here and we'll change it to float instead that'll make it one value and on the default value we'll turn that to one and if we hit the tab key to go outside of the node group we need to turn the scale back to one but now that'll control the entire size of all the textures so it'll change the size of the material so let's go back into the node group now I also want to control the detail and so we have these two base textures here and they both have detail values so I'll put the detail into the extra socket and then the other detail I'm going to put that into the same socket so this detail will control both of the details of both textures at the same time now what I also want to do is just control the chunks detail and we have this roughness value here which does a really good job doing that so let's put the roughness into the extra socket and then if I double click on this to rename it I'll rename it to chunks detail and then I also want to do the same thing for the noise so the noise has a roughness value which can make it look super detailed so I'll put the roughness into the extra socket double click on this to rename it and I'll just rename it to noise detail then I want to control the colors so I'll drag the group input right up here let's drag it over here and you can see that color A and color B on both of these they're both fully black so I'm going to put A into the extra socket and then this other one here B we'll put that into the same socket since they're both black and I'll double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to color one then here on B this is the dark gray so we can put that into the extra socket I'll double click on this and rename it to color two then I want to control the chunks height so this hue saturation value has a value which makes the colors lighter or darker and so by turning the value up and down that is going to make it lighter and darker and because that is eventually going into the displacement it's actually affecting the displacement so we can put the value into the extra socket here double click on this to rename it and I can rename it to chunks height then I want to control the chunk scale so we can just go here to the voronoi we can take that scale value and just put that into the extra socket and I'll rename this one on the side panel here to chunk scale then I want to be able to control the noise scale so we'll just take the scale from the noise and put that into the extra socket and let's just rename this to noise scale then I want to control the roughness of the material so I'll select the group input here and I'll drag the group input somewhere over here and you can see there's this roughness so the roughness has this value and the value is going to make it lighter or darker that is changing the roughness so we'll put the value into the extra socket here let's double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to roughness then I want to control the bump strength so we'll drag the group input down here or drag it over here and let's take the bump strength here we'll put that into the extra socket and then double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to bump strength and then I just want to control the displacement strength so let's take the scale and put that into the extra socket and I'll rename this one to displacement strength all right I'll drag the group input right back here I'll just drag it at the end of the node setup I'll hit the n key to close the side panel and I can hit the tab key to go outside of the node so we have the scale value so you can change the size of the texture so it fits the scale of your object we also have this cool detail value so you can kind of make it look like a stylized chunky concrete if you want to do that then we also have the chunks detail and the noise detail and then we have the different colors here so color one and color two so you could like make color two kind of like a brownish color or a reddish color if you want it to look more like a brownish rock or something like that then we also have the chunk height so you can make it really small if you want to and just have it like less damaged or you can make it look super damaged and chunky then we have the chunk scale and then also the noise scale then we have the roughness the material so if you turn the roughness way down it kind of looks like a metallic material and then we also have the bump strength and then finally the displacement strength to pop out the mesh so that'll be it for this tutorial so i hope you enjoyed this i hope you found it helpful and thank you for watching and if you'd like to help support me and this youtube

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZrWP9SJ3Kc,Procedural Black Veined Marble Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor demonstrates how to create a procedural black veined marble material and organize it into a custom node group for easy customization. The tutorial covers adjusting various parameters such as scale, vein scale, noise scale, colors, distortion, veins visibility, veins detail, subsurface scattering, roughness, and bump strength. The instructor also promotes their Gumroad store and Patreon page, where viewers can purchase this material, along with a marble and granite material pack and an Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which includes future updates and setup for Blender's asset browser.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural black veined marble material. And then after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group so you can customize the material. So there is a scale value so you can make the material bigger or smaller on your object. Then there is a vein scale so you can just change the size of the veins. And then there's also a noise scale. Then there's three different colors, so color one is this default black color. Then there's color two, which is kind of like this gray color in the middle. And then there's color three, and this is the veins color. Then there's distortion value, so you can make the veins more distorted if you want to. Then there's also the veins visibility, so you can turn this up a little bit to see more of the veins, or turn it way down if you want them to be more subtle. And then we have the veins detail amount. And then we have also the veins distortion. And then we have the subsurface, so marble does allow a little bit of light to go through the material, so you can change the subsurface scattering right there. And then we have the roughness of the material. And then we also have the bump strength if you want the surface to be a little bit bumpy. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material and help support the channel, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description. And you can also check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials. And my Ultimate Material Pack will also come with future updates when I make more materials. So once you've set up the material pack as an asset library in the Blender, then you can just drag and drop the materials into your 3D scenes. And I've also just released a procedural marble and granite material pack, which comes with all of these marble and granite materials. You can check out that material pack with the links in the description. You can also purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist. The links are in the description. So if you want to set up the 3D scene the same way that I have, then I'll show you what I did. So I went to the Add menu, and I went to Mesh, and added an icosphere. And then right behind me on the Add Icosphere Settings, I turned the subdivisions up to 6, so it is nice and smooth and round. And I will use the Object Context menu and shade it smooth. Now the default objects in Blender are quite large, so I'm going to scale this object down to like a 0.2, and then I will apply the scale. Then I'm going to move this over here, and I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll add a cube. And I'm going to scale the cube way down, and I'll press Ctrl-A and apply the scale. And I'll move the cube over. I can double tap the R key to use the trackball rotation and just kind of rotate the cube. And then if I go into Edit Mode, I'll press Ctrl-B. Then I'm going to drag my mouse to make the bevel bigger, and I can use my scroll wheel to add more cuts to the bevel. So I'll just make a nice, big, smooth bevel like that. Go back to Object Mode, and I'll shade this object smooth. Then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera, and then click over here to go to the Object Data Properties, I turned the focal length to 80 just because it zooms the camera in a little bit, and I like that better. Now as for the lighting, I added a few different area lights. So I added this large area light right here, and I set the power to 120, and it's pointing down at the objects. And then I wanted to add a bit of a rim light and some reflections on the bottom. So I added this really big area light, and this one I turned the power to 50, so we get some nice lighting. Now also to get some more realistic lighting and reflections, I went here to the World Properties, and I added in the Machineshop 02 1K HDRI from polyhaven.com. I'll have the link in the video description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to Color, and you can choose Environment Texture, and then just click on the Open button and open up the HDRI. And then just a few more settings I'm going to go over. I'm going to be using the Cycles rendering engine because I'm going for realism. So that's over here on the Render Properties. And also, if you want to make the background transparent, you can open up the Film tab and just click on the Transparent button. So the HDRI will still light the scene, but it's not quite as distracting, and you can't see in the background. And then also here on the Color Management, I'm going to be using the View Transformer filmic, and I'll set the look to Very High Contrast to make the colors pop out and to make it more contrasted and saturated. So I'm in the Shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the Rendered mode. I'm just going to make this smaller, so we have a bit more space here, and I'll make this side panel smaller. So I'll select one of the objects. Let's click on New to add a new material. And I'll just rename this to Black Veined Marble. And then I can select the other object and add the same Black Veined Marble material. Now I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So you can click on Edit. You can go to the Preferences. And over here on the Add-ons tab, if you go to the Search and search for the Node Wrangler, just enable the Node Wrangler add-on, so it's built in a Blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture, and we'll drop it here. Now to use the feature of the Node Wrangler, you can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and then select different nodes, and that's going to preview the node on the object. Now also with the Voronoi texture selected, I'll press Ctrl T to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And I want to use the object coordinates because the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. So we're going to put the object into the vector of the mapping, and let's drag these down here. Then let's change some of the settings of this Voronoi. So I'm going to turn the scale up to a 10, and also right up here on this type, I'm going to change the feature output to distance to edge, and that way it's going to have those little cracks there. So the scale is going to be 10, the detail will turn up to 5 so it has a bit more detail, and the roughness I'll turn to a 0.84. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now it does look really dark right now, but we are going to make it lighter. Now what I want to do is distort this texture to make it look a little bit more noisy and random. So I'm going to go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a mix color. We'll put the mix color between the mapping and the Voronoi. So what we're going to do is mix the vector between the mapping and a noise texture. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. We'll drop this here. Let's drag these nodes back, and I'm going to bring the noise texture down here. Let's Ctrl Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And I want to use the same object coordinates, so the vector of the mapping will go into the vector of the noise texture. And then let's change the settings. So I'll turn the scale to a 25. Let's also turn the detail all the way up to 15, and I'll turn the roughness up a little bit to a 0.65. So now this noise texture, the factor is going to go into color B, and the original mapping is going to go into color A of the mix. And then let's Ctrl Shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it. Now on the mix type here, I'm going to change this to the linear light instead. So it is a little bit hard to see. I want to show you what this is doing, but it's kind of hard to see because it's a bit dark. So to make it lighter, let's drag these nodes back, and I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a map range node to control the white values and dark values. So we'll put the map range here after the Voronoi. So let's drag it over here. So now what I can do is I can change this to a min value. You can see if I turn this up, it's going to be a bit brighter. So I'm going to turn this to min to just like a 0.4, so it's a bit brighter. Now here on the 2 max, we can also turn this up to make it more contrasty. So this 2 max value, I'm going to turn this up to a 90. So now you can definitely see that quite a bit better. You can see what it's doing. So now let's go back here to this linear light. So this mix node is mixing between the noise and the mapping. So if I drag the factor around, if I turn it to 0, it's just using the mapping. But if I turn it up more and more, it's going to use more and more of the noise. So it's being more distorted. So I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.05, so it's just using a little bit of the noise texture. So that way it's distorting the Voronoi texture because it's going through the vector. And so now you can see that that original texture that we had kind of has a bit of noise, and it looks a bit random. So that's going to look a lot better. Now, I also want to make another Voronoi texture, and it's going to be distorted the same way. So I'm going to select these two textures. I'll press Ctrl-Shift-D to duplicate the nodes, but keep the wires plugged up. We'll drop them down here, and I'm going to Ctrl-Shift and select this one here. So we now have another Voronoi and another map range, and I want to change these settings to make the texture look a bit different. So I'm going to turn the scale to 12, and the roughness, I'll just turn to like a 0.8. And then on the map range node here, we can use these values to make it lighter or darker. So I'm going to change these a little bit. So the 2 max, I'm going to turn this to an 85. And then the 2 min, I'm going to turn to a 0.54. But then I'll leave the other settings how they are. So I can hold down the Ctrl-Shift key and select the different map ranges, and you can see we have two different textures now. So I want to add some colors to both of these, and we're going to be mixing them together. So first, on this bottom one here, I want to make the colors. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a mix color. I will put this after the map range, and the result is going to go into the factor. So now I can make the two colors. So color B is going to be fully black, and then color A is going to be kind of like a gray color. And if you want to use the same exact hex value I'm using for color A, the hex value is going to be 54524F. So those are going to be the first colors. So then I want to mix in the other Voronoi. So I'm going to drag these back so I have more space. I'll select the mix, and I'll duplicate it and stick it right here. Now what we want to do is put the map range into the factor, and then this mix down here, this is going to go into color B. So if I now take color A and turn up the color, this is going to be the veins of the marble. So for color A, I'm going to make this a pretty light color. And the hex value for this color here on color A is going to be a hex value of 6Cs. So now if I zoom in closely, you can see we have some really detailed veins in the marble. Then we have a few little gray bits, but it is pretty subtle, and then of course there's the black. So let's take the mixed result, and I can put that into the base color, and I can Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And then here on the roughness, I'm going to turn this way down to a 0.16, so it is much more shiny. Now I also want to add a little bit of subsurface scattering, so let's open up the subsurface here. And I'm going to turn this way up to a 0.5, because marble does allow a little bit of light to go through the material, so I just want to add a little bit of subsurface. And then I do want to add a little bit of surface bump, but I want it to be pretty subtle. So let's take the mixed result, and I can put that into the normal. But then to convert the color data into bump data, or normal data, I'll go to the add menu. We're going to search for the bump node, and I'll stick it between the mix and the normal. And the mixed result is going to go into the height value, so now it's being converted to bump data. But I want this very subtle, so I'll turn the strength down to a 0.02. So it is pretty subtle. So there's just a tiny bit of bump over the surface. And then there's just one more thing I forgot to do. So if I go to the Voronoi texture, and go to the bottom Voronoi, I want to turn this detail value up to 15, and that way it's going to be more detailed. So if I zoom in there, you can kind of see that gray marble better. So if I control shift and select the mix there, now you can definitely see that that subtle gray marble has a lot more detail. So I'll control shift and select the principled shader, and that is it for the procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group, so you can have customizable values. So I'll just click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output. I'll press control G to join it together into a node group. And then I'll hit the N key to open the side panel, and I'll click here on the group tab. And on the interface, I'm going to double click on this to rename it. And I'll rename it to shader, because I like that better. So I'll now hit the tab key to go outside of the node group, and I'll drag the node group over here. Let's make it a bit bigger. And then I will copy the material name, and I'll paste it here in the node group so that it's called Black Veined Marble. So I'll hit the tab key to go into the node group, and let's go over here and select the group input. And we can plug values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures, so the scale values will change the size of the entire material. So we'll put the scale into the extra socket here. And if I click on the scale, right now it is three values, but I want it to be one value. So we'll click on the type here, and we'll change it to float, so it is one value. Now the default value, I need to turn that to one. And then we'll go outside of the node group, and the scale here, I need to turn to one. So now this can control the entire size of the material. So we'll go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the vein scale, so we'll drag the group input up here. And this top Voronoi has a scale value, so let's put the scale into the extra socket. And if I double click on this to rename it, I'll rename it to vein scale. Then let's drag the group input back here. And this noise texture has a scale as well, so I want to use that to change the noise scale. So we'll put the scale into the extra socket. Let's rename this one here to noise scale. Then I want to control the colors, so I'll drag the group input right over here. And then I first want to take the black color, put that into the extra socket. Then the gray color into the extra socket. And then also right here, we'll put this into the extra socket, the last one. And let's rename these, so I'll rename them to color one, and then also color two. And then for the last one here, you could call it color three, but I'm actually going to rename it to veins color, because that's a bit more detailed, because it is controlling the color of the veins. Then I want to control the distortion, so I'll drag the group input back. And this linear light here, which is the mix color, you can drag the factor to make the texture more distorted. So I'll put the factor into the extra socket, and I'll rename it to distortion. Then I want to control the visibility of the veins. So if we go up here to this top Voronoi in the map range, this map range value has the from max. So if I drag this up and down, that'll make it more or less visible. So let's take the from max, we'll put that into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to veins visibility. Then I want to control the detail of the veins. And so this noise texture here is distorting the Voronoi. So you can see if I drag this up and down, that is changing the detail of the veins. So we'll put the detail into the extra socket, and I'll rename that to veins detail. And then let's also add this distortion value. So I'll put the distortion into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to veins distortion. And then let's click on the group input, and I'll drag it way over here. And I want to control a few more things over here. So I want to control the subsurface. So I'll put the subsurface weight into the extra socket. And I'm just going to rename it to subsurface or subsurface scattering, whatever you want to call it. And then I want to control the roughness value. So I'll put the roughness into the extra socket. And then finally, we'll put the bump strength into the extra socket. And I'll just rename this to bump strength. All right, so I'll drag the group input back down here. I'll hit the Tab key to go outside of the node group. Let's hit the N key to close that side panel. And there is the finished black veined marble material. So I'll just review the material. So we have the scale value. Then we also just have the vein scale, and we just have the noise scale. And then we have the different colors, so color one. And we also have color two. And then we also have the veins color. So this could actually look really cool if you make it maybe like a bright blue color or something like that, maybe even a red color. Red looks kind of cool. So you can really customize the material. Then we have the distortion value to make it more distorted or less distorted. We also have the veins visibility if you want to see more of them, or you can turn it down to make it more subtle. We also have the veins detail and the distortion of the veins. And then we have the subsurface scattering. So it is a little bit hard to see on this material. But if you look kind of on the edges, there is a little bit of light going through the material. And then we have the roughness. You can make it more like a polished marble or a less polished metal. So that'll change the roughness. And then finally, the bump strength if you want to make the surface a bit bumpy. So that'll wrap it up for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed the tutorial. And thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyA_TgrklOk,Procedural Green Camo Fabric Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural green camo fabric material and combine it into a custom node group. The tutorial covers various controls, such as adjusting the scale, colors, fabric weave, noise, and folds, as well as applying a sheen for a realistic fabric look. Additionally, the instructor provides instructions for setting up a cloth physics simulation for previewing the material on a cloth object. The video concludes by offering the option to purchase the procedural material and other material packs on the creator's Gumroad store and Patreon page, along with a link to a playlist for more procedural material tutorials.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural green camo fabric material. And after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group. So we have the overall scale here, so you can change the size of the entire material on your object. And then we have four different colors for the camo. So if you want to make it more like a brown camo, you could do that. Or we could make it kind of like a light brown for like a desert camo, or more of like a green color. So there's four different colors to change the colors of the material. Then we also have the fabric weave scale. So if I zoom in really close to the material, you can see there is some bump there of the fabric weave, so you can change the scale there. Then we also have the fabric noise scale, which is just a little bit of noise over the surface to make it look kind of fuzzy. And then we have the fabric noise scale. So if you kind of look here on this object, there is actually a little bit of fabric noise just to make the fabric look like it's a little bit bumpy and a little bit folded. Then we also have the sheen value here, and this will help to make it look more like fabric. So you can kind of see the shading there on the edges. It just looks a little bit brighter when the sheen is turned up. And then there's also the sheen tint, and I have this set to kind of like a grayish greenish color. And then we have the bump strength. So we have the weave bump strength. And then we just also have the noise bump strength. And then we also have the folds bump strength.

So I'll now show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I wanted to preview this material on a sphere. So I went to the add menu and I added an icosphere. And right behind me on the add icosphere settings, I turned the subdivisions up to six. So it is nice and smooth and round. And I'll use the object context menu and shade is smooth. Then I'm going to scale this object down by 0.2. So it's a better size when modeling to the real life scale in Blender. And I'll press Control A and just apply the scale. So that's the object's new default size and just move this over. Now I'm also going to go to the add menu, I'm going to add a UV sphere. And I'll scale a sphere down and move it over here. I'll actually move it a little bit farther away. And I'm going to be creating a simple cloth physics so that we actually can preview this on a cloth object. Let's also shade this object smooth. I'm also going to go to the add menu, we're going to add a plane. And let's move the plane above the sphere and we'll scale it down a little bit, something like that, and then apply the scale. We'll go into edit mode. And I'm going to use the object context menu and click on subdivide. You can also press Control E, and then you can click on subdivide. Now after you subdivide it, you can click on the subdivide settings right behind me. And you can turn up the number of cuts. And I'm just going to make it pretty detailed, maybe something like that. Let's also subdivide it one more time. So it's even more detailed. So now I can go back to object mode. And I want to actually add the cloth physics to this object. So over here on the side panel, we're going to go to the physics properties, and we're going to add cloth. And then on the cloth, let's scroll down here. We want to open up the collisions. And we want to check mark the self collision so it actually collides with itself. Now I've been doing this in the shading workspace. But if you go here to the layout, you should have a timeline right here. So I'm going to drag the playhead on the timeline back to the starting. And I can press the spacebar to play this. And we'll just let this simulate. Now this might be happening for you where the cloth simulation is kind of scrunching up. And that is because of the distance of the vertices. So what I can actually do a really easy way to fix this is just to scale both of these objects up much bigger. And now if I play the simulation, you can see that it's not bunching up like that. So let's select this object here. And on the physics, we're going to add the collision. So now when I press the spacebar to play this, you can see the cloth will actually collide with it. And then I can kind of scale this object up, maybe move it down, bring it forward a little bit. And you can just play around with this until you get a simulation that you like. I think I want it to be a little bit bigger. Alright, so something like that is pretty good. So I'll just use the object context menu and shade it smooth. And then to apply this, we need to click here on the modifiers. And on the modifiers, we want to click on the drop down and apply the cloth modifier. Now to make this look more realistic, I can press Ctrl 2 to add a subdivision surface with two levels. And then let's scale both of these objects down. And I'm going to just bring this object over here and just stick it next to the other sphere. And then also, if you select the cloth object, you can click on add modifier, and you can add the solidify modifier. And let's drag these little dots here and drag it up above the subsurface so that it first adds the solidify and then adds the subdivision. And I'm going to drag this thickness value way down just to make it very thin. And that's basically all I did to create the cloth. And if you're interested in learning more about cloth physics in Blender, then definitely check out my cloth physics for beginners tutorial with the link in the video description. Then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera and go to the object data properties of the camera, I turn the focal length up to 80 just to kind of zoom it in because I like how that looks a bit better. And then I added some lights to the scene. So I'll just go into the rendered viewport mode. So I can see this in the rendered view. So I added these two lights here. So these are both area lights. If you go to the add menu, you can go to lay and add an area light. And this first one here I set to 50 and just made it pretty large shining down on the objects. And then this one here is set to 30. And I have it kind of as a backlight. So both of the objects are kind of coming from the back of the objects. Now to get some more realistic lighting and reflections, I also went here to the world properties and I added in the Machineshop 02 1K HDRI from polyhaven.com. And I'll have the link in the video description if you'd like to download the same HDRI. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version on Polyhaven. So when you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot next to color, you can choose environment texture, and then click on the open button and just add in the HDRI that you downloaded. And then I also set the strength to 0.8 so it was a little bit less bright. Now just a few more settings that I'm going to go over. So if you go over here to the render properties, I'm going to be using the cycles rendering engine. And now here on the film tab, I'm going to check mark the transparent button. So the background is transparent, but it will still light the scene. And then also, if you go down here to the bottom and open up the color management, I set the view transform to filmic and the look to very high contrast to pop out the colors and make everything more contrasted and saturated. So I am going to go over here to the shading workspace. So in the shading workspace, I have the 3D viewport on this side, and I will go up into the rendered viewport mode. And then I have the shader editor right here so we can work with the nodes. So I'm going to select one of the objects. Let's click on new to add a new material. And I can drag and drop the same material onto this object here so they both have the same material. And then I can rename this to green camo fabric. And then I'll also be using the node wrangler add on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the node wrangler enabled, you can click on edit. You can go to the preferences. And on the add ons tab, you can go to the search and search for node wrangler. Just enable the node wrangler add on. And it's built in a blender. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So let's close the user preferences. So we're going to start off by creating three different patterns. So I'll go to the add menu. Let's add a noise texture and drop it here. And I can hold down the control and shift key and select different nodes. And that is using the feature of the node wrangler. And it's going to preview the nodes on the object. Let's also press control T with the noise texture selected to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And usually I like to use the object and I like to put the object into the vector because it places the procedural textures on the object more evenly. However, I'm going to use the UVs in this case. And I'm using the UVs because this is going to be put on cloth objects because it is a fabric material. And so when you're using cloth objects, you want the procedural material to actually move along with the folds of the object. So it would be really weird if the material was super random and just changed at random points when the cloth is moving around. But with a real cloth in the real world, the pattern moves along with the folds of the cloth and also the fabric weaves move along as well. So that's why I'm going to be using the UVs instead. Now, if your objects haven't been UV unwrapped, then there's going to be some issues. For example, you can see the default UV unwrap has some cuts here. And so you are going to see a few seams here in the texture. However, this object here was from a plane and the plane was already UV unwrapped. So there aren't any issues. If I just turn the scale up so you can kind of see that better, there aren't any issues. And you can see how the noise is actually moving along with the folds of the fabric. So that's why I'm going to be using the UV instead. So let's now change some of the settings of the noise. So on the type here, I'm going to change this to the hetero terrain. And on the scale, I'm going to turn this to 70. Then on the roughness, I'm going to turn this to zero. And I'll just leave it how it is. But then I'm going to go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for another noise texture. And we're going to drop this in between the mapping and the noise. So this way, because this noise texture is going through the vector, it's distorting the placement of this noise. Now you can see it looks very distorted. But let's change some of the settings. So for this noise, I'm going to turn the scale to a 1.7. Let's also turn the detail to the max of 15. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now I want to make it more contrasty. So let's drag these nodes back. And I'll go to the Add menu. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And we'll put the color up here after this noise. Now on the linear here, I'm going to change it to constant instead. And then I can drag this white tab over to make it more contrasty. So I'm going to drag the white tab over to about there. So now you can see there's some little white areas and black areas. So that's starting to look like the camouflage texture. Now this procedural material will get a little bit complex. So I want to keep my nodes nicely organized by adding frames. So I'm going to box select these nodes. I'll press Control-J to join them into a frame. And then you can drag the frame around. And if you select the frame and press F2 to add a label, I'm going to call this mapping. Now I'm going to click and drag to box select these nodes. And I'll press Control-J to join them together into a frame. You can select the frame and press F2 to add a label. And I'm going to rename this to Pattern 1. Now I want to make three different patterns. So I'm going to select all these nodes. And I'll press Control-Shift-D. Control-Shift-D will duplicate the nodes but keep these wires plugged up. Let's Control-Shift and select this color ramp. Then I can change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to a 45 of the first noise texture. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now on the second one here, I'm going to turn this detail value way down to like a 7. And then I'll leave those settings how they are. Now here on the color ramp, I want to drag this white tab out kind of to about here. And then I want to hold down the Control key and click here to add another tab. And I'm going to drag this one kind of over to about here. So you can kind of see how that texture is looking. So let's select this frame here and press F2 to add a label. And let's rename it to Pattern 2. And then I'll box select these nodes. I'll press Control-Shift-D to duplicate them again. Let's Control-Shift and select this one here. And I can select the Pattern 2, press F2 to change the label, and we'll change it to Pattern 3. And then for this one, I'm going to turn this first noise scale to a 90. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. But then on this back one here, I'm going to turn the scale to a 1.2. I'll turn the detail to the max of 15. And then the roughness, I'm going to turn this to a 0.45. Now here on this color ramp, I want to select the black tab. I'll hit the minus to get rid of it. And then I'll just kind of drag this around and get it to something that I like. So something like that is looking better. So if I Control-Shift and select them, you can see we have three different groups of textures. And I now want to join them together and add the custom colors. So I'm going to drag these nodes back. I'll close that side panel. And I want to go to the Add menu. And to mix colors together, we can add the Mix Color node. So we'll drop this down here. So I want to have three different Mix nodes. So the first one is going to add the custom colors for the first one. And then we'll use the other two Mix nodes to mix these patterns together. So what I'm going to do is take pattern one. We'll put the color from the color ramp into the factor. And I'll Control-Shift and select the mix to preview. And then let's make the custom colors. So for color A, this is going to be kind of like a grayish light green. And for color B, this will be a little bit of a darker green. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, you can use the same hex values. So color A will be a hex value of 4C6741. And then color B is going to be a hex value of 3B562F. So let's duplicate the mix. And we're going to drop it right here. And we can now use this to mix in the next one. So this pattern two here, this is going to go into the factor. And then this mix here is going to go into color A. So now color B can be the color of the next texture. So for color B, let's make this like a really dark green. And the hex value for this dark green here in color B is going to be a hex value of 1A2F17. So we'll duplicate the mix one more time and drop it here. And again, this mix here, this is going to go into color A. And then this pattern three, that is going to go into the factor. And the factor is determining what parts will be color A and what parts will be color B on the object. Now for this one, it's going to be a bit lighter and kind of a grayish color. So kind of like a grayish green. And the hex value for color B is going to be 2A3C1F. So that is going to be the base color. So what I can do is drop the principled shader right here. Maybe bring this up. Let's bring these further back. So now we have all these mixes. And let's drag the mix colors up together. Just kind of compact them so it looks a bit more nice and organized. And let's box select these three nodes. I'll press Control J to add a frame. We'll hit F2 to add a label. And I can just rename these to like base colors. And make sure the mixed result is going into the base color of the principled shader. Now you can see that this fabric is looking a little bit too shiny. It doesn't really look realistic. So on this roughness here, I'm going to turn this up to like a 0.8. So it looks quite a bit more rough. So I'm now going to be creating the fabric weave texture. So to do this, we'll go to the add menu. And let's search for a wave texture. We'll drop this down here. And I want to use the same mapping. Because we want to use the UVs. So the vector is going to go into the vector of the wave texture. I can also hold down the Shift key and right click and drag over the wire to add this reroute. And I'll drag the reroute down here. And then I'll Shift and right click and drag to add another reroute. And drag this over here. Just because I like to keep the nodes super organized. Let's Control Shift and select the wave texture. And I'll zoom in here so we can preview it. And let's change some of the settings. So for this one, I'm going to change the scale to like a 350. And then also this distortion here. I'm just going to turn up to a very small number like a 5. So if I zoom way in, you can kind of see what the distortion is doing. So it's just making it look a tiny little bit more random. And then let's turn the detail level all the way to the max of 15. But then I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now I'm going to select this wave texture. And I'll press Control Shift D to duplicate the node. But keep the wire plugged up. Let's Control Shift and select this one to preview it. And I'm going to keep all the settings the same except that I'm going to take the X. And I'm going to turn this to Y instead. So this way it will be going in the opposite direction. So I now want to mix these together to create the fabric weave texture. First though, I want to make them a little bit more contrasty. So I'll go to the add menu. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. I will put the color ramp after the wave. And then I can drag this black tab over to make it more contrasty. And I'll bring it to about there. Then I'll press Shift D to duplicate. We'll drop it down here. And the other wave texture color can go into the factor. So now it looks more contrasty. Now to mix them together with a mix color, you can box select the two color ramps. And you can press Control 0. Control 0 is the shortcut key for adding the mix color node. And you can see it's already plugging them both up. And then I'm just going to leave the type set to mix. And I'll leave the factor to 0.5. And this way you can see we're getting kind of this checker of these little white lines with the black squares. And so that is looking like fabric weave. So let's box select all these nodes. And I'll press Control J to add them into a frame. And I'll press F2 to add a label. And I'll rename this to fabric weave. So let's Control Shift and select the principle shader. And I now want to put some values into the normal to give it some bump. So we're going to take this mix result here from the fabric weave. We're going to put that into the normal. But there's some weird shading issues. And that's because we need to convert the color data into normal data that the shader can use. So I'll go to the Add menu. Let's add a bump node. We'll put the bump node here between the mix and the principle shader. And we want the mix result to be going into the height value. So now you can see the fabric looks really bumpy. But that is way too strong. So I'm going to turn the bump strength down to like a 0.25. So it's much more subtle. So let's duplicate this bump node and drop it here after the first one. And we're going to duplicate this one more time and drop it here. So now we have three of them. Now these other two I'm going to use to make it a bit more fuzzy and then also to add some folds. So to create those textures, we'll go to the Add menu. We're going to add a noise texture. Let's drop it here. And we're also going to duplicate it and put another one. So we have two different noise textures. Let's Control Shift select this noise texture to preview it. And I want to use the same mapping. So I can actually go here to this reroute. And I can click and drag and let go here. And then I can search for reroute and just add a reroute there. Then I can click, drag over, let go. And again I can add another reroute. And then click and drag and stick this up to the vector. Now let's do that for the same noise texture here. So I can take this reroute and put that into the vector of this noise texture. So now let's change some of the noise settings. So for this one I'm going to turn the scale to 40. So it can add a lot of fuzz. Actually not a 40. I want to change it to 400. So now it's much more detailed. Let's turn the detail to 15. And this roughness here I'll turn to like a 0.55. So now we have a pretty detailed texture. So now this noise texture factor can go into the height value of this bump. And I can Control Shift and select the principal shader. Now if I turn this strength up here you can see it's going to be stronger. So you can see now it looks much more like a fuzzy fabric. Although that is way too strong. It looks really rough. So let's turn this strength way down to just like a 0.1. So it's going to be much more subtle. But that'll definitely make it look a bit more noisy and bumpy on the surface. And then I also want to use this noise texture to here to add some folds. So I actually want to preview this on this sphere. Because you'll kind of be able to see that better. So let's Control Shift and select this noise texture preview it. And to change the settings we're going to turn the scale to a 10. And I'll just leave the detail at 2. So that it doesn't have that much detail. It looks kind of like folds. And then this distortion here I'm going to turn the distortion to a 0.4. So it's just a little bit distorted. And it kind of moves around in circular motions. So we can put the factor into the height value of this bump. Let's Control Shift and select the principal shader to preview it. And if I turn up the strength you can see what it's doing. So it looks like there's some little folds in the fabric. But I'm going to turn the strength way down to like a 0.2. So it is much less strong. So we can box select these nodes here. I can press Control J to join them into a frame. And I'll press F2 to add a label. And I can just call this bump. Now I also want to add the sheen to make it look more like fabric. So let's open up the sheen here on the principal. And I'm going to turn the weight all the way up to 1. And I'll leave the roughness at 0.5. But you can change this if you want to. And then for the tint I'm going to make this kind of like a light green. And the tint hex value that I'm going to be using for this color will be 617F49. So that is it for the procedural material. So I'm now going to show you how to join this together into a custom node group. So let's click and drag and box select all the nodes except the material output. You can press Control G to join it together into a node group. Now if you press the Tab key that's going to go in and out of the node group. So I'll go out of the node group and I'll drag the node group over here. And let's zoom in here and I'm going to click and drag to make it bigger. And then I can copy the green camo fabric. I'll press Control C to copy that and then Control V to paste that. So now it's called green camo fabric. So let's hit the Tab key to go into the node group. And I'll press the N key to open up this side panel. And if you click here on the group tab you can change the interface here. So I'm going to double click on this to rename it. And I'll rename this to shader because I like that better. So if you go outside of the node group you can see that socket there is just called shader. So let's go back into the node group. Now if you go right over here to this side we have the group input and we can plug values up to the group input to control those values outside of the node group. So this mapping node is being plugged up to all the textures. So this scale value will change the size of the entire material. So we'll put the scale into the socket here and then if I click on the scale it's going to be three values. But I instead just want it to be one value. So let's change the type here to float instead so it's one value. And then I'll turn the default value to one. And then if I go outside of the node group we need to turn the scale back to one. So it's using a scale of one. So let's go back into the node group. So I now want to add all the custom colors. So I'm going to drag the group input right up here above these base colors. And I'll put color A into the extra socket. Also color B. And then also color B of the next mix. And then finally this one here. So we'll put that into the extra socket. And then you can click right here to rename them. And I'm going to rename these colors one through four. So I now want to control the fabric weave scale. So we're going to drag the group input down here behind the fabric weave. And we're going to put this scale right here into the extra socket. And then we can take the same weave texture and we can put this scale into the same socket. So this way this single scale value will control both of the waves. So if I double click on this to rename it. I'll rename this to fabric weave scale. Now I'm going to drag the group input right over here underneath the bumps. And I want to take the first noise and we'll put that into the extra socket. And I'll double click on this to rename it. And I'll rename this to fabric noise scale. And then let's also do the same thing for this one. So we'll take this other noise scale and put that into the extra socket. But this one instead of fabric noise scale it's going to be called fabric fold scale. Then I want to control the roughness of the material. So we'll drag this up here next to the principled shader. And let's take the roughness value and we'll put that into the extra socket. And then I also want to add the sheen. So we'll add this sheen weight here. Put that into the extra socket. And then also if you want to you could put the sheen roughness into the extra socket there. But I'm just going to not do that and use the tint instead. So we'll put the tint into the extra socket. And you can see it's called the sheen tint. And then I want to control the bump strengths. So we'll drag this behind the bump. You can see this first one here is controlling the weaves. So we'll put the strength into the extra socket. And I'll rename this to weave bump strength. Then the second one is just the noise. So we'll put this into the extra socket. And I'll double click on this and rename it to noise bump strength. And then the final one here that is going to be the folds. We'll put the strength into the extra socket. Double click on this to rename it. And I'll rename this to folds bump strength. All right I'll select the group input and I'll drag it back here to the very end. I'll press the n key to close the side panel. I'll hit the tab key to go outside of the node group. And there is the finished procedural material. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the entire material. And remember this is being controlled by the UVs. So if you don't like how the texture is placed on the object you could use the object coordinates instead or you could just UV unwrap your object. Then we have all the different colors. So we have colors one through four. So you can really change these if you want to make more like a brown camo or desert camo or whatever you want to do. Then we have the fabric weave scale. We have the fabric noise scale and the fabric fold scale. Then we have the roughness of the material. But it looks a little bit weird if it's really shiny. So I usually leave the roughness value higher because it's fabric. And then we also have the sheen weight. This kind of helps to make it look more like fabric. And then we also have that sheen tint. And then we have the bump strength. So the weave bump strength and the noise bump strength and the folds bump strength. So that's it for this tutorial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whdl1zZEtAk,Procedural Clay Pot Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural clay pot material in Blender, including adding realistic horizontal lines simulating a hand-crafted effect from a potter's wheel. The tutorial guides viewers through creating a custom node group with various customizable settings such as scale, line texture, dirt amount, and colors. It also covers how to add a glaze effect for a shiny finish. The video promotes purchasing the material and other procedural materials on Gumroad and Patreon, along with a review of an Auto Bake plugin for texture baking. The tutorial concludes with setting up lighting and rendering settings.","In this blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural clay pot material. And then after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group. Now also if I zoom into this clay pot material, you can see there are some little lines going horizontally along the material. And I wanted to add that effect because when someone is making a clay pot by hand using a potter's wheel, the piece of clay spins around really fast creating these little lines in the texture. So that's a small detail that I added to this material. So the custom node group has some different customizable settings, so you can change the scale of the entire material. Then you can just change the texture of those lines there, so the line scale. And then there's also a dirt scale, so there is a little bit of dirt along the surface. Then you can change the clay color 1, and then you can also change the clay color 2. And then we also have the dirt color, so there is a little layer of dirt over the surface of the material. You can change the dirt color there. Then we also have the lines distortion, so if you want them to be distorted and less straight, you can change that. Then we also have the dirt amount, so you can turn this up if you want it to look more dirty. And then we have the roughness of the material. And then we also have the lines bump strength, so there's the texture of those horizontal lines. And then we also just have the noise bump strength. Now also, sometimes clay pots have a glaze, a painted glaze, which is over the object. And so there's this glaze amount here, so you can turn the glaze up. And so this is going to add kind of that shiny layer, and it looks like it's been painted with this clear finish or glaze. And then there's also this glaze roughness, so you can make it more rough or more shiny if you want to.

And to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist. And then one more thing before we start, I wanted to let you know about a really great Blender add-on for easy texture baking. Auto Bake is a really great Blender add-on for easy texture baking. Select the object that you want to bake, and then you can add any of the texture maps in the bake list. You can then change many of the settings, like the name of the texture, the texture resolution, and where you want the add-on to export the textures. Then just hit the Auto Bake button, and the add-on will automatically texture bake all the textures and save them as files on your computer. You can find my full add-on review video with the link in the description, and if you purchase the add-on through my affiliate link, you'll be helping to support this channel. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the Add menu, and I went to Mesh, and I added an Icosphere, and right behind me on the Add Icosphere settings, I turned the subdivisions up to 6, so it is nice and smooth and round, and I used the Object Context menu to shade it smooth. Then I scaled the object down by about a 0.3, and then I pressed Ctrl-A and just applied the scale. Now I also wanted to preview this material on a clay pot and a clay vase, so I modeled these two objects here. So these objects were both very easy to model. I basically just added a circle, and I extruded the circle up and scaled out the extrusion, and then scaled it back in, and just created the basic shape, and I did that for this vase here, and then also did the same exact thing for the pot, just extruding the edges and then scaling it up and down to create the shape. And then after I modeled the basic shape of these objects, I added a solidify modifier to give them some thickness, and then I also added a subdivision surface modifier to smooth them out. Then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera and you go to the object data properties of the camera, I turned the focal length to 80, just because it kind of zooms the camera in a bit and make things look a bit more flat, and I kind of like that better. Now as for the lighting, I added these two different area lights right here. So this first one is adding light from the top, and I set the power to 40, and this other one here is kind of on the side, and I set the power to 100. This will help to give some nice lighting. And also right over here on the world properties, I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDRI from polyhaven.com, and I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot next to color, and you can choose environment texture, and then just click on the open button and open up the HDRI. And I turned the strength of the HDRI down to 0.4 so it wasn't quite as bright. And then also here on the render properties, down here on the color management, I set the view transform to filmic and the look to very high contrast to make the colors more contrasted and saturated. And then also here on the film tab, I checkmarked the transparent button, and that way the background is transparent, so it's not quite as distracting, but it'll still light the 3DC. Alright, so I am in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here. I'm going to go into the camera view and go into the rendered viewport mode, and then I can select one of the objects. I'll click on new to add a new material, and I can just call this material clay pot. And then I will just add the same material to the other objects so they all have the same material. And then I'm also going to be using the node wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So to enable the node wrangler, you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences, and here in the add-ons tab, you can search for node and just enable the node wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So I'm going to start off by adding a texture for the dirt. So I'll go to the add menu, and we're going to search for a noise texture. Let's drop it here. And then to use the feature of the node wrangler, you can hold down the ctrl and shift key and select different nodes to preview them. And with the noise texture selected, let's press ctrl T to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now you can see here on some of these objects, the noise looks slightly stretched. So I'm going to use the object coordinates and put that into the vector instead. And the object coordinates are going to place the procedural texture on the object more evenly. And let's change some of the settings of the noise texture. So I'll turn the scale to 10, I'll turn the detail to the max of 15, and I'll turn the roughness up to like a 0.55 so it has more detail. And then if I turn up this lackinarity value, it's going to add a bunch of little dots to the texture. So I'm going to turn this up to a 3.1, so there are a little bit of those dots. Now let's drag the texture coordinate and mapping back, and I want to add another noise texture up here. So I'll go to the add menu, we can search for a noise texture and drop it up here. And we're going to use this noise texture to create those waves or those lines which are going back and forth. But we're going to be mixing it also with the wave texture. First, let's take the mapping vector and put that into the vector of the noise texture. And I can ctrl shift and select it to preview it. So then what I want to do to make it look noisy, but also have the lines is to go to the add menu and search for a wave texture. And we're going to put this wave texture between the mapping and the noise. So now we can change both the settings, the wave and the noise. So on the wave texture here, I'm going to change the x to z instead. And this way the lines are going to be going around in a circle, then I'll change the scale to four, I'm going to turn the distortion to one. So it's a little bit random. And I'll turn the detail to the maximum of 15. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. But then on the noise texture, we can use this to also make it look more noisy. So I'm going to turn this scale to a point three, so it's pretty small, but then I'll turn the detail to the max of 15. You can already see it's looking a bit more detailed, and also turn this roughness value to a point seven, and I'll leave those settings how they are. So now you can see that we have these little lines there, but they're a little bit lumpy and bumpy, and they kind of go up and down, they're a little bit random and a bit noisy. So I now want to create the custom colors for this material. So I'll go to the add menu, and we're going to search for a mix color, we'll put this here after this top noise texture. Now the factor can go into the factor value. So now here in color A and color B, we can make the two colors. So for color A, I'm going to make this kind of like a bright, peachy, kind of tannish color, kind of like a light brown. And then color B, this is going to be also a light brown, but a little bit darker. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, you can use the same hex values. So color A is going to be a hex value of E2, 8C, 6, 5. And color B is going to be a hex value of AA, 6, 4, 4, 8. And then what I also want to do is mix in the dirt. So we're going to select this mix, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here after the first one. Now this noise texture factor can go into the factor. So we're adding this dirt texture on top. And then I just want to add the dark values of this noise texture, because I just want to add those little darker parts there on top of the other texture. So on the mix type here, we can change this to darken. And darken will now just add those dark values. So now color B is going to be the actual color for the dirt. So you can see if I make it darker, you're able to see it better. So I'm just going to make it kind of like a dark brown color. And the hex value that I'll be using for color B here, the dirt color, is going to be 4A3022. Now later on in the custom node group, I want to be able to control the amount of dirt. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to add a hue saturation value. And I'll put this between the noise and the darken. So now this value here, if I drag this up and down, it's going to make it lighter or darker. And so that will in turn add more dirt or less dirt. So we'll use that later in the custom node group. So then I want to take this darken result, and I want to put that into the base color. And I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And I also want to turn the roughness down a little bit to like a 0.4, so it's a little bit more shiny. So it's very smooth right now, and so I want to add some surface bump. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a bump node. We'll use the bump node to convert the texture data into bump data. So the first one that I want to add is this top noise here. So let's plug the top noise factor into the normal, but then to convert it to proper normal data, we're going to take the bump node, and we're going to put it in between the noise and the normal. And I can stick it down here. We want the noise texture factor to be going into the height value. So now you can see it looks super bumpy, but that is way too strong. So I'm going to turn this value down to like a 0.06, so it's less bumpy. Then I also want to add the noise onto the surface. So we'll take this bump, and I'll press shifty to duplicate it and drop it here after the first one. So I can now take this noise texture factor, and I'll put that into the height value, and this way we can mix multiple bump maps together. But then this bump strength, I'm going to turn to like a 0.1. If I drag it up stronger, you can kind of see what it's doing. So it's just some surface bump. I'm just going to leave it at a small number of 0.1. Now also, we can go here to the coat. We can open up the clear coat, and the clear coat, we can turn this up to add kind of that glaze effect. So you can see if I turn this way up, it looks super shiny on the surface, and then there's also a roughness value. Now the problem with this is that the shininess doesn't have any surface bump, and that just doesn't really look right because the surface looks bumpy. So to fix this, we're going to take this last bump normal, and we're going to put that into the normal of the clear coat. So now the clear coat is really shiny, but it has the same surface bump. So the weight value is going to add more of the clear coat or less of it, and then of course there is the roughness value. So I'm going to leave the clear coat to zero because I don't want it on on default, but you could turn it up if you want it. And this roughness here, I like a value of 0.2. I think 0.2 is pretty good. So that is it for the procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So I'll click and drag here to box select all the nodes except the material output, and I'll press Ctrl G to join it together into a node group. Now if you press the N key to open up the side panel and go to the group tab, I want to rename this shader here to shader instead of BSDF. So if you hit the Tab key to go outside of the node group, you can see it's called shader now instead of BSDF. So I'll drag the node here. Let's drag it out bigger, and then I can also rename the node group to clay pot. So let's hit the Tab key to go back into the node group, and if we go over here, we have this group input, and we can plug values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So I'm going to take the scale from the mapping and put that into the group input, put that right in there, and then if I click on the scale, I want to just make it one value instead of three. So we're going to change this type to float instead, and then the default value we're going to turn to one, and if we go outside of the node group, we want to turn this scale back to one. Let's go back into the node group. Then I want to control the line scale, so we'll drag this scale over here, and the wave texture scale can be used to change the lines. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket, and let's click right here to rename it, and I'll rename it to line scale. Then I want to control the dirt scale, so we're going to take this noise texture scale, we'll put that into the extra socket, and I'll just rename this to dirt scale. Then I want to control the colors, so we're going to drag the group input right up here, and we're going to put color A into the extra socket and color B into the extra socket, and these ones I'm going to rename to clay color one, and then the other one here will be clay color two, and then here on this darken, this is the dirt color, so we'll put B into the extra socket, and I can rename this to dirt color. And then also I want to be able to control the lines distortion, so we'll drag the group input back here, and on the wave texture, we're going to put the distortion in the extra socket, and I'll rename this to lines distortion. Then I want to control the dirt amount, so we can take the hue saturation value, we're going to put the value into the extra socket there, and I can rename this to dirt amount. And then I want to control the roughness and the bump strength, so we'll drag this down here, let's put the roughness from the principled shader into the extra socket, and then let's take this first bump, we'll put that into the extra socket, and the second one, this one's going to be the noise, so we'll put that one into the extra socket, and we're going to rename these, so this one is going to be lines bump strength, and then this other one here is going to be the noise bump strength. Then I want to control the glaze, so on this coat weight here, we can put this into the extra socket, and then right here, I can double click on this, and I can rename this to glaze amount. And then I also want to control the glaze roughness, so we'll put this roughness here into the extra socket, and instead of coat roughness, I'm going to rename it to glaze roughness. Alright, so I'll bring the group input back over here, I'll hit the n key to close the side panel, and I'll hit the tab key to go outside of the node group. And let's just review the final material. So we have the overall scale of the material, then we just have the line scale, and we just have the dirt scale, we also have the different clay colors, so clay colors one and two, and then we also have that dirt color. Then we also have the lines distortion, we also have the dirt amount, and we have the roughness of the material. Then we have the lines bump strength, and the noise bump strength, and then also that glaze amount if you want to look like it has kind of a glaze or a finish on it, and then also the glaze roughness.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoKgNCCY0HY,Procedural Aqua Marble Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural aqua marble material and integrate it into a custom node for easy adjustments. The material allows customization of scale, color, roughness, and subsurface scattering, with additional controls for distortion and detail levels. The video also covers setting up a 3D scene with objects and lighting, and suggests supporting the creator by purchasing the material on Gumroad or Patreon. The tutorial concludes by highlighting the flexibility of the material and directing viewers to additional resources and material packs available for purchase.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural aqua marble material. And then after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node. So we have the scale value, so you can change the size of the entire material on your object. And then we have two different colors, so color one and color two. So of course you could have these kind of be the aqua colors, or you could really make it any other color you want. So you could do kind of like a tannish and brownish marble, or you could even do like a blue marble. Then we have the roughness value, so you can make the marble more rough or more shiny on the surface. And then we also have the subsurface value, because marble does actually have a little bit of subsurface scattering, so light can go through the marble. So you have that value there. And then we have four distortion values and three detail values. So you can play around with all these values and really get some different variations of the marble. So if you want to look super detailed, you could turn up this distortion. Now you can see there's a lot more noisy detail and it's really small. You can also change this distortion value here. And then there's also all these detail values, so you could turn them down if you want less detail, or keep them up if you want lots of detail.

And to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So before we start, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu and I added an icosphere. And right behind me on the add icosphere settings, I turned the subdivisions up to six, so it is nice and smooth. And you can use the object context menu and shade that smooth. And then I scaled the object down by 0.2, and I pressed Ctrl A and just applied the scale. So that's better when modeling to a real life scale in Blender because the default objects are quite large. I also thought it would be cool to preview this on a monkey head. So I went to the add menu and I added a monkey head and I pressed Ctrl 3 to add a subdivision surface with three levels. And over here on the modifier panel, I can just apply the subsurf and I can use the object context menu and shade it smooth. And I can scale the object down and I'll type in 0.2, hit enter, and I'll press Ctrl A and apply the scale. And I'll just move the monkey head over and maybe rotate it. Then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera and go to the object data properties of the camera, I turned the focal length up to 80 just because it zooms the camera in a bit and I like how that looks better. Now as for the lighting, I added this area light right here. So if I go into the rendered viewport mode, you can see I added this area light and I turned the power up to like an 80 and just left it as a white color. And then also to get some more realistic lighting and reflections, I went here to the world properties and I added in this Machineshop 0.2 1K HDRI. This is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com and I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version on Polyhaven. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot next to color, you can choose environment texture, and then click on the open button and open up the downloaded HDRI. And I also turned the strength down to 0.8 just so it's a little bit less bright. And then if you want to make the background transparent, you can go up here to the render properties, you can open up the film tab, and you can checkmark the transparent button. And also here on the color management, I set the view transform to filmic and the look to very high contrast. So I'm in the shading workspace. So I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here and I'm in the render mood and I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll just select the object, I'll click on new to add a new material, I can just rename this material to aquamarble. And then I can click and drag and drop the same material onto the other object. And then I'm also going to be using the node wrangler add on. So to enable it, you can go to edit, you can go to the preferences. And over here on the add ons tab, if you go to the search and search for the node wrangler, you can enable the node wrangler add on. So it's built in a blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So let's close the user preferences. So to start off, I want to go to the ad menu, and I'm going to search for a wave texture. Let's drop the wave texture down here. And I will Ctrl Shift and select the wave texture to preview it. Now the wave texture looks all straight right now, but we're going to be adding some other nodes to the wave texture to distort it. So it looks all random and looks more like marble. Let's select the wave texture, and I'm going to press Ctrl T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I want to use the object coordinates, so we'll plug the object into the vector. And that way it'll place the texture on the object more evenly. Now let's change some of the wave texture settings. So on the sign here, I'm going to change it to saw instead. And that'll kind of make it so it starts as black and then gets lighter and then gets black again. And I like that better, and it will work better for the marble material that I'm going for. Let's also turn the scale down. So I'm going to turn the scale to just like a 1.5, and I'll turn the distortion to a high value like 16, and I'll turn the detail to 15. And then the detail scale here, I could turn this up to like a 1.3. There's a bit more detail. And then the detail roughness, I could turn up to like a 0.7. So now you can see we're getting this cool effect, and it looks very noisy and random on the edges. Now I want to distort it more, so I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And we'll put the noise texture between the mapping and the wave. So now the noise texture is going through the vector, so it's distorting the placement of the wave texture. And let's change some of the noise settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 2. I also want to turn the detail to the maximum of 15, so it's more detailed. And I'll turn the roughness up to like a 0.7. So now you can see that's definitely looking more detailed. Now I want the noise texture to have less of an effect over the wave texture, so we're going to go to the Add menu, and we're going to search for a mix color. And we'll put the mix color between the noise and the wave. Now this mapping vector is going to go up into color A, and then the noise texture factor is going to go into color B. So we're using this mix to mix between the original mapping, which isn't distorted, and the noise texture, which is very distorted. Now on the mix type here, I'm going to change this to the linear light instead. Let's drag the wave texture up here. So now I can drag this factor around, and you can see it's blending between not being distorted and being very distorted. And I'm going to turn the factor up to 1, so it's very distorted. But this can also be used later in the custom node group to control the distortion. Now I also want to add some more texture detail, so I'm going to go to the Add menu, and I'll search for a Voronoi texture. We'll put the Voronoi above the wave texture. And let's Ctrl Shift and select this Voronoi to preview it, and I want to change some of the settings. So on this F1 here, I'll change this to distance to edge, so we have that cool crack texture. And then let's turn the scale to 6. But then all the other settings, I'm going to leave how they are. Now I want to also distort this to make it look more random. So I'm going to select this linear light here. I'll press Shift D to duplicate it and drop it up here. And I'm going to put the result into the vector, so this will be distorting it. But then I want to mix between the mapping, which is using the object coordinates, and this linear light here. So let's take the mapping vector, and I can put that into color A. And then this linear light here, this one is going to go into color B. So now if I drag this factor around, you can see it's distorting it a lot. So let's drag the linear light back here, and then this Voronoi can go over the wave. And then this factor, I'm going to turn this to 8.2, so it is distorted but not quite as much. So now I want to mix the Voronoi and the wave together. So I'm going to hold down the Shift key and select both textures, and I'll press Ctrl 0. So Ctrl 0 is going to add this mix color. We can click on the arrow to open it up and drag it here. And on the type here, I just want to add the light values, so we're going to change this to light instead. And make sure the wave color is going into B, and the Voronoi distance is going into A. So now as I drag the factor, you can see it's just adding the light values on top, and I'm going to turn the value to 8.7. So here's the Voronoi, here's the wave, and then here it is mixed together. Now to add even more detail to this, I'm going to be adding a color ramp and making more contrasty colors. So I'll go to the Add menu, let's add a color ramp and put it after the lighten. And then I'm going to drag this tab right over here, and then I'll hold down the Ctrl key and click here to add another tab, and click here to add another tab. Now what we're going to do is have the tabs get lighter and darker. So this one here, let's make this kind of like a darker color. And then this one here, we're going to make a lighter color. And then this one here, we're also going to make a darker color. So you can see it's dark, then it gets lighter, then it gets darker, and then it gets lighter. So by changing between lighter and darker, you can see it's adding even more detail. So there's some darker parts here, then there's some lighter parts, and then there's some darker parts. And you can especially see it happening if I kind of drag these around. So you can see if they're just both light and then both dark, there isn't quite as much variation. But by changing between light and dark, you can see it's adding more variation. And if you zoom way in here, you can see there's so much cool detail there in the marble texture. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using on this color ramp, I will just go through all the hex values. So this first one here, this color is going to be a hex value of 3E3E3E. Then this lighter one here, this one will be a hex value of C6C6C6. Then this one here is going to be a hex value of 363636. And then the final one here, this one is just going to be completely white. So it's going to be 6S. So I now want to actually make the custom colors for the marble. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll search for another mix color, and we'll put this after the color ramp. And let's actually drag the principled shader and drop it right here after the mix. And you can Ctrl Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now I want the color ramp colors to control what parts are going to be color A and what parts are going to be color B. So we're going to put the color into the factor. So now for color A and B, we can make the custom colors. So for color A, I'm going to make this kind of a greenish bluish color, and it's going to be darker. And then for color B, this is kind of going to be just like a light green. And if you want to use the same exact colors for color A, this is going to be a hex value of 274C46. And color B, this is going to be a hex value of 8FBFAE. And then also let's turn the roughness way down. So I'll turn the roughness to like a 0.1. So it looks more like a shiny marble. And also let's add some subsurface scattering, because marble does allow a little bit of light to go through. So we should add some subsurface. So we'll open up the subsurface tab, and I'll turn the weight all the way up to 1. All right, and that is the procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So let's click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output. And I'll press Ctrl G to join them together into a node group. And if you press the Tab key, that'll go in and out of the node group. So we'll go out of the node group, and I can drag it over here. Let's make it a bit bigger. And then I can copy the material name, and I can paste it here in the node group. So let's hit the Tab key to go into the node group. I'll press the N key to open the side panel. And if you click on the group tab, right here on the interface, I want to double click on this, and I'll rename it to shader, just because I like that better. And then if I go over here to the side, this group input, we can plug values up to the group input to control those values outside of the node group. So I want to control the overall scale of the entire material. So this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures. So we can take the scale, and I can put that into the group input. But then if I click here on the scale value, this is going to be three values. But I want one value to control the entire scale. So on the type here, let's change this to a float instead. And that way, it's going to be one value. But then I need to turn the default value back to one. And I need to go outside of the node group. And I want to turn the scale back to one. So let's go back inside the node group. Then I want to control the custom colors. So we'll drag the group input right up here. And we can take color A, put that into the extra socket, and color B into the extra socket. And if I double click on them to rename them, I'll rename this one to color one, and color two. Then I want to control the roughness of the material. So let's take the roughness value and put that into the extra socket. And I also want to control the subsurface. So we'll put the subsurface weight into the extra socket. And if I double click on this to rename it, I'll just rename it to subsurface or you can call it subsurface scattering or whatever you want to call it. So I now want to control the distortion values. So we'll drag the group input back over here. And the first distortion value is going to be this linear light here. So you can see the factor is going to change the distortion. So put the factor into the extra socket. Let's double click on this to rename it. And I'll rename it to distortion one. Then for the second distortion value, I want to use this light in here. You can see that's changing the distortion. So let's put the factor into the extra socket. And this one I can rename to distortion two. Then for the third distortion value, this noise texture has a roughness value. You can see that's changing the distortion as well. So we'll put the roughness into the extra socket. And this one we'll rename to distortion three. And then for the last distortion, I want to take this wave distortion value, you can see this one is making it distorted as well. So we'll put this wave distortion into the extra socket. And this one's going to be distortion four, then I want to have three different detail values. So the first one's going to be this detail here on the noise. So put that into the extra socket, then the second detail value is going to be the detail on the wave texture. So put this one into the extra socket. And the last one is going to be the detail scale on the wave texture. So put that into the extra socket. And if I double click on them to rename them, I'll rename it to detail one, detail two, and then also detail three. Alright, let's hit the N key to close the side panel, I can drag the group input down here, and I'll hit the tab key to go outside of the node group. And we can now review the final material. So we have the overall scale, then we have the different colors. So color one and color two, we also have the surface roughness of the marble, then we also have the subsurface. And then we have distortion one, distortion two, distortion three, and distortion four. And then we have detail one, and we have detail two, and we have detail three. So this material is quite customizable with all the distortions and the details. So that'll be it for this tutorial, so I hope you enjoyed this, and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GHxyfWhw08,Procedural Gold Solar Panels Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural gold solar panel material, inspired by the solar panels on the International Space Station. The tutorial covers the creation of a custom node group to control various aspects of the material, such as scale, metallic appearance, color variations, grid visibility, roughness, and bump strength. The video also promotes additional resources, including a classic blue solar panel material tutorial, a Sci-Fi Construction Robot tutorial series, and purchasable materials on Gumroad and Patreon. The process involves setting up the 3D viewport, adding lighting, and using various nodes to achieve the desired material effects.","In this blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural gold solar panels material. Now, if you're wanting to create a more original classic blue solar panels material, then I have another solar panels material which I created a little while back, and you can check out that video with the link in the description. But I had the idea to create these solar panels, because these are what the solar panels look like on the International Space Station. Now, after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group, so you can control the look of the material. So we have the scale value, so you can use this to change the size of the material on your object. We also have a metallic value, if you want to make it look less metallic. And then we have the two colors here, so we kind of have the gold color. You can make it a different color if you want. And then we also have color two here, and that is going to be the black color. Then we also have this grid visibility. So if I turn this down, it's going to get rid of that other grid there. So you can see there's another grid there, kind of in the center, but it's a little bit less visible, and you could make it more visible and less visible. Then we have the roughness of the material, so you can make it more reflective or more rough. And then we finally have the bump strength. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. And you can also check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials. Now, if you like creating sci-fi artworks in Blender, then you might be interested in checking out my Sci-Fi Construction Robot Blender tutorial series. So that's an 11-part tutorial series, where I show you step-by-step, in real-time, how to create this sci-fi construction robot. So the course covers the entire process, including modeling the robot, doing the materials and the lighting, and even rigging and animating the robot. And then we render the animation and create this finished robot animation. If you'd like to learn more about the course, you can check out the course trailer video with the link in the description, and I'll have the product pages linked in the description. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport, if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the Add menu, and I went to Mesh, and I added an Icosphere. And then right behind me on the Add Icosphere settings, I turned the subdivisions up to 6, so it is nice and smooth. And then I used the Object Context menu and shaded it smooth. And then I want to scale this down better to the real-life scale in Blender, so I'm going to scale this down by 0.2, and I will press Ctrl-A and apply the scale. I'll also go to the Add menu and add a plane, and I'll scale this plane down by 0.2, and also press Ctrl-A and apply the scale. And I'll move this over, and I'm going to rotate it on the X-axis, and I'll bring these into the center. Then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera and go to the Object Data properties of the camera, I turned the focal length up to 80, just to kind of zoom the camera in a little bit. Now for the lighting, I added in this area light right here. So I'll just go into the rendered viewport mode so you can see the light. So I added this area light, and I turned the power up to 8. And then also if you go over here to the World properties, I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDRI from polyhaven.com. Link will be in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version on Polyhaven. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot next to Color, and you can choose Environment Texture, and then just click on the Open button and open up the HDRI. And then if you want to make the background transparent like I have, you can go up here to the Render properties, and you can open up the Film tab, and then just click on the Transparent button. And then also if you open up the Color Management settings right here, down here on the bottom, I changed the view transform to Filmic, and I set the look to very high contrast to make everything more contrasted and saturated. So I'm in the Shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here. I'm in the rendered mode, and I'm going to go into the camera view. And then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll just select the object, click on New to add a new material, and I will click and drag and drop this material onto the other object so they both have the same material. And I'll just rename this material to Gold Solar Panels. And then I'll also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit, you can go to the Preferences, and then on the Add-ons tab, if you go to the Search and search for Node Wrangler, you can checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on so it's built in a Blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, I'm going to go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a brick texture. And let's hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and select the brick texture, and that's using the feature of the Node Wrangler, and it's going to preview the brick texture on the object. Let's also select the brick, and we're going to press Ctrl T to add the texture coordinate and mapping, and I want to use the object coordinates, so I'll put the object into the vector, and the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. Now, if you are previewing the material on a sphere, the brick texture might be showing from the top. So if you want to, you can just rotate this, rotate it on the x-axis by 90 degrees, so you can kind of see it from the side view. All right, so let's now change the brick texture settings. So I'm going to turn this offset all the way up to 1 so it doesn't look like bricks and it looks more like solar panels. Then here on Color 1 and Color 2, I'll make these fully white, and the mortar, I'm going to make fully black. And then I'll leave all the other settings how they are. Now, I want to make three different brick textures, and we'll be mixing them together. So I'll bring this brick texture down here, and I'll press Ctrl Shift D. So Ctrl Shift D will duplicate the node but keep the wire plugged up. Let's Ctrl Shift and select this brick texture, and we can change these settings. So for this one, I'm going to turn the scale to 20 so it is much smaller. And on the mortar smooth, I'm going to turn this to a 0.4. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. And then I'll select the brick texture, I'll press Ctrl Shift D to duplicate the node but keep the wire plugged up. Let's Ctrl Shift and select this brick texture, and I want to change these settings. So for this one, I'm going to turn the scale to 120, and also the mortar size, I'm going to turn to a 0.17. And then also here on the brick width and the row height, I want them both to be a 0.5 so that they're little squares instead. And this mortar smooth, I will turn to 0. So now I want to mix all these brick textures together. So to mix them, I can select this one, Shift select this one, and then I'll press Ctrl 0. Ctrl 0 is going to add this mix color node, and it's going to mix them both together. Now on the mix type here, I just want to see the dark values or I want to add the dark values, so I'm going to change this to darken. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select the darken to preview it. So I can now drag the factor, and that's going to add that dark value. So if I turn this all the way up to 1, it's just adding it all the way and it's fully black, but I want it to be more subtle, so I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.3. And that way it's much more subtle, but you can still see it a little bit. Let's select this darken, and I'll press Shift D to duplicate it and drop it here. And I want to use this one to mix up the last brick texture. So this darken result is going to go into color A, and then this top brick texture, that's going to go into the factor. And then let's Ctrl Shift and select the darken to preview it. So because it's just adding the dark values, I can just make color B fully black, and that's just going to add those dark values. So basically now we have that kind of gray bit right there, which is hard to see. Then we have these big black spots, and then we have all these little black squares. So now let's make the custom colors. So I'm going to drag the shader nodes back here, and I'll select this darken. I'll press Shift D to duplicate it and drop it here. And the result, we want to put that into the factor. And then here on the darken type, I want to change that to mix instead. So now color A and color B can be the custom colors. So for color A, I'm going to make this that gold color. And then for color B, this is going to be a very dark gray color. And if you want to use the exact same colors that I'm using, color A is going to be a hex value of FFA048. And then color B is going to be a hex value of 262626. So let's take the mixed result, and I can put that into the base color, and I can Control Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And then let's turn the metallic all the way up to one and turn the roughness down to make it look more like metal. Now, I also want to put this value into the normal to give it some bump. So let's put the result into the normal. And then to convert it to bump data, I'll go to the Add menu, and I need to search for a bump node. And we'll put the bump node between the darken and the principled. And to convert the color data into bump data, we want the darkened result to be going into the height value. So now if I zoom in here, you can see the edges look nice and bumpy. And it's a bit too strong, so I'm going to turn the strength to a 0.2 on the bump. Now, I also want to make a little bit of variation in the roughness, so some parts are more rough and other parts are more shiny. So I'll go to the Add menu, and let's search for a noise texture and drop it down here. And I want to put the mapping vector into the vector of the noise. And let's Control Shift and select the noise to preview it. So I'm going to turn the scale to 50, and I'll make the detail all the way to the max 15. And I'll turn the roughness up to a 0.6, so it's even more detailed. So now the noise texture factor, that can go into the roughness to control how rough or shiny it is. And let's Control Shift and select the principled shader. Now, I want to have more control over the roughness, so I want to change the colors. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'll search for a color ramp. We'll put the color ramp here after the noise. Let's also select these and drag them out a bit so we have a bit more space. So I want to drag the black tab over, and that's going to make it more contrasty, so it's more shiny. So I'll drag the black tab to about here. And then I'll make this white tab kind of a dark gray color, because if it is more dark, it's going to be more shiny. And the hex value that I'll be using for this dark color is going to be B7, B7, B7. Now, when we join this together into a custom node group, I'm going to want to control the roughness values. So we'll go to the Add menu, and we're going to search for a hue saturation value. And we'll put this after the color ramp. So now the value on the hue saturation value is going to make it lighter or darker, so that will control the roughness. So that is it for the procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So I'll box select all the nodes except the material output, and I'll press Control-G to join together into a node group. And if you press the Tab key, that's going to go in and out of the node group. So I'll drag the node group over here. Let's make it bigger. And I can copy the material name, and I'll paste it here into the node group. Let's hit the Tab key to go into the node group, and I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel. And if you click here on the Group tab, there's going to be the inputs and outputs here on the interface. So I'm going to double click on this, and I'll rename it to Shader because I like that better. So now here on the group input, we can plug values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So let's take this scale from the mapping, and I can put that into the group input. And so that way, this mapping is plugged up to all the textures, so this scale will control the size of the entire material. Now, if I click on the scale here, you can see it's three values, but I instead just want it to be one value. So let's click on the type here, and I'm going to change it to float instead so it is one value. And then we need to turn the default value to 1. And then if I go outside of the node group, we need to turn the scale back to 1. So that will control the scale of the material. So let's go back into the node group. So I want to drag the node group right up here, and then I want to plug the metallic value into the extra socket so we can control that. And then I also want to plug color A and color B into the extra sockets. And I'll double click on them to rename them, and I'll rename this to color 1 and color 2. And then I want to control the grid visibility. So if I drag this back here, we have this darkened factor, and that'll control the visibility of the larger grid. So I'll plug the factor into the extra socket. And if I double click on this to rename this here, I'll rename it to grid visibility. Then I want to control the roughness of the material. So let's take the value from the hue saturation value, and I can put that into the group input. And I can double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename it to roughness. Then I want to control the bump strength. So if I drag the group input down here, let's take the bump strength, we can put that to the extra socket. And I can double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename it to bump strength. So I will drag the group input back here. I'll hit the N key to close the side panel, and I'll hit the tab key to go outside of the node group. And we can now review the final material. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the material. Then you can also make it more metallic or less metallic. And then we also have the custom colors. So you can kind of make this a gold color or maybe like a blue color or just a white color. And then we also have color two, which is that dark color. Then we have that grid visibility there, which is that larger grid. And then we have the roughness of the material. And then finally we have the bump strength. So that'll finish it up for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x85I0BTNvAY,Procedural Wavy Marble Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural wavy marble material and integrate it into a custom node group for easy customization. The tutorial covers adjusting various parameters like scale, color, wave detail, and bump strength, and emphasizes the use of subsurface scattering to enhance realism. Additionally, the video promotes the creator's Gumroad and Patreon pages for purchasing procedural materials, including the comprehensive Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, and offers links to a YouTube playlist for further learning.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural wavy marble material. And after I show you how to create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group so you can easily customize the material. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the entire material. Then we just have the noise scale, and we just have the wavy scale. And then we have the colors for this marble. So we have color 1, and we also have color 2, and then also color 3. Then we have the color hue, so you can easily just drag this value. If you want to change the hue, you could make it like a blue marble or kind of a red marble. Then we also have the waves detail, so you can turn the detail level up and down of the waves. Also the waves distortion, so this will make it really distorted. And then also the waves roughness, and this is kind of like another detail value. Then we have the roughness of the material, if you want to make a really shiny marble or more rough. And then we have the bump strength, so I have this at a very small number because I want the marble to look really shiny, but you could make it more rough if you want to. And then we finally have the subsurface scattering. So marble actually has a small amount of subsurface scattering to allow a little bit of light to go through. So I can turn up the subsurface scattering, and you can see here on this cat statue, there's just a little bit of subsurface and there's a little bit of light going through kind of the thinner parts like the cat's ears. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material and help support the channel, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. The links are in the description. And if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials, then definitely check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my procedural materials, and they're all pre-set up for Blender's Asset Browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. And every time I create another 10 procedural materials, I update the material pack with all of the new materials. So I've just updated the Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack with all of these new materials, so all of my existing customers can re-download the product files to get the new updates with the new materials. And if you'd just like to purchase these 10 most recent procedural materials I've made, then you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Pack number 19, which come with just these new materials. You can also purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. The links are all in the description. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I wanted to preview the material on a sphere, so I went to the Add menu, I went to Mesh, and I added an Icosphere. And then right behind me on the Add Icosphere settings, I turned the subdivisions up to 6, so it is nice and smooth and round. And then I used the Object Context menu to shade the object smooth. And then I want to scale this down so it's closer to the real-life scale in Blender, because the default objects are a bit larger than an average human, so this is a really big sphere. So I'm going to scale this object down by 0.2, and then I'll press Ctrl-A and apply the scale, so that's the default size of the object. Now I also wanted to see how this marble material would look like on a statue, so I added in this cat statue, and this is a photo scan that I downloaded from Sketchfab. So if you'd like to download the same model to use it as a material preview, then I will have the links in the description to the model on Sketchfab if you'd like to download it. Then I also added this camera here, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera, and then go over here to the side panel and go to the object data properties of the camera, I turned the focal length up to 80, just because I wanted to kind of zoom in a bit and make it look a bit more flat, because I like that better. And then also here on the render properties, I am going for realism, so I am going to be using the Cycles rendering engine. But if you wanted to, you could also make the material in Eevee. Here's the material in Blender Eevee, so you can do this in Cycles or Eevee, but I'll be using Cycles for more realism. So after changing the render engine over to Cycles, I also added some different area lights. So I added these three area lights right here, so I have one kind of on the back to kind of have a rim light. Then I have this one up here, which is going to add a nice light to the top of the objects. And then I have this main light right here, which is adding a lot of brightness to the side of the objects. Now also to get some realistic lighting and reflections in the 3D scene, I also went over here to the world properties, and I added this Aerodynamics Workshop 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, and the link will be in the description if you'd like to download it. So what you can do is click on the yellow dot here next to color. You can choose environment texture, and then you can click on the open button and just add in the downloaded HDRI. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version on Polyhaven. And then I didn't want it to be super bright, so I turned the strength down to a .4. Now also let's go here to the render properties. And here in the color management, I set the view transform to filmic and the look to very high contrast to make everything more contrasted and saturated. And also if you want to make the background transparent, you can go to the film tab and you can just click on the transparent button. So you can click over here to go to the shader editor, and I'm going to close this side panel and make this smaller. So I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mode and in the camera view. And then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll click on new to add a new material, and I can rename this to wavy marble. And then I'm also going to be using the node wrangler add-on in this tutorial to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the node wrangler enabled, you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences, and over here on the add-ons tab, if you go to the search, you can search for node, and you can just check mark the node wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So let's close the user preferences. So I want to start off by adding two different textures, and that's going to be a noise and a wave texture. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's drop it here. We can also go to the add menu and search for a wave texture and drop it down here. And these are the two main textures which will be used to create the material. Now also with the noise texture selected, I'm going to press control T and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I want to use the object coordinates because the object coordinates are going to place the textures on the object more evenly. So let's put the object into the vector. And I can control shift and select the noise texture preview it. And by holding down the control and shift key and selecting different nodes, that is using the node wrangler and it's going to preview the node on the object. Let's also take the vector of the mapping and put that into the vector of the wave texture. So let's now change some of the settings of the noise texture. So I'm going to turn the scale to two. I'm also going to turn the detail to the max of 15 and I also want it to be super detailed so I'll turn the roughness all the way up to one. Also I didn't add the material onto this object here. So I'm going to select this object and I will click and drag and drop the material onto this object so they both have the same material. All right, let's control shift and select the wave texture and I want to change some of these settings as well. So on the X here, I'm going to change it to Z instead so they're going back and forth. I'm going to turn the scale to two. I'll turn the distortion up quite a bit to seven and then I want it to be very detailed so I'll turn the detail to the max of 15 and the detail roughness I'll turn to a 0.75. So it is more detailed. Now if I control shift and select the noise texture, I want to kind of squish the noise texture down so it is kind of going along the same directions as the waves are. So I'm going to select this mapping node. I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here so it's in between the noise and the other mapping. So I can use this mapping to squish down the texture. So on the Z value, I'm going to turn this to five and that's going to squish it down so you can now see the noise texture is kind of squished and it kind of has more of a lines there. It's kind of hard to see but if I drag this Z value down, you can kind of see what it's doing but what I now want to do is make it more contrasty so it's easier to see. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a color ramp. We'll put the color ramp here after the noise texture. So now I can drag both of these colors together and that's going to make it more contrasty. So I'll drag the white tab here and the black tab kind of to about there. That looks pretty good. And then I want to duplicate this to make another one which we're going to use later. So I'll press control shift D. So control shift D will duplicate the node but keep the wires plugged up. And then this one here, I want it to be a little bit darker so I'm going to drag this over here. If I control shift and select it to preview it, I'm going to drag the black tab over and the white tab back a bit. So this one is going to be kind of a little bit lighter than this one will be a bit darker. So we're going to use those later to create the material. Now I also want to make the wave texture more contrasty and I want to add more waves in between the waves. So we're going to select this color ramp. I'll press shift D to duplicate it. We can drop it down here and the wave texture color can go into the factor and I'll control shift and select the color ramp to preview it. So let's change the values. So I'm first going to put the white tab all the way over here and I'm going to hold down the control key and click here to add another one. So we have two white ones on this side and I'll bring them pretty close. Then I'll drag the black tab kind of to about here and I'll hold down the control key and click to add another tab there. And then I want to add some more white ones. So I'll hold down the control key and click here in between these two ones and that way it'll add a super white one and we can drag this over here and then you can click here to add another one and you can drag this over. So basically what we're doing by changing it between white and then black and then white and then black, it's going to make lots of waves in between those waves. So we're adding a lot more detail to the waves. Let's also hold down the control key and click again and I can drag this over here and control click again and then control click again and we'll bring this over and we're going to control click in here where this white one is and drag over. So now we have two white ones, then we have a black one and then we have another black one and then we have some more white ones here and you can see when I drag this around you can see what part of the texture it's controlling. Then I have two more black ones and then a white one and a black one. So you can see it starts out as white, then it gets black and then white and black and white and so there's some really cool texture variation there because we're making it super contrasty and going back and forth between white and black. Now I want this wavy marble to also have some noise so we're now going to be mixing these two textures together. So I'm going to hold down the shift key and select both of these two bottom color ramps and I'll now press control zero and control zero is going to add the mix color node and I can drag it over here and it's going to mix them both together. Now on this mix here I want that to be going into color A but this color ramp here which is the waves, that's going to go into the factor. And then on this mix type here I just want to change it to lighten instead so we'll change it to lighten so it adds the light values. And here on color B if I make this darker it's going to show more of the noise but then if I turn this up because it's adding the light values it's going to add the light values of where the wave texture is. So if I control shift and select the color ramp here these white values are going to be added on top of the noise. So you can see there's a big white spot there and kind of over there so if I control shift and select the lighten they're just going to be those white waves above the noise texture. So now it looks noisy in between where the dark areas are and then it's going to be white where the waves are so that's looking much more interesting. So now I want to make the colors so I'm going to go to the add menu and we're just going to search for another mix color and we can drop this here after the lighten and we can put the lighten result into the factor. So now the light and black values are going to control what parts are going to be color A and what parts are going to be color B. So for color A I'm going to make this kind of like a light brown color something like that and for color B this is going to be kind of like a gray color. And if you want to use the same exact colors I'm using for color A you can go to the hex value and you can punch in 6F, 4F, 4, 0 and then for color B the hex value for this one is C7, C5, C4. So this is the two main colors but then I'm also going to use this color ramp here to add some more noise and we're going to add another color. So we'll click on this mix here I'll press shift to duplicate it we can drop it here and the mix result this is going to go into color A. So now we can take this color ramp here and this is going to go into the factor to determine what parts are going to be color A and what parts are going to be color B. So I'll control shift and select the mix to preview it and then here on color B this one is going to be that other color. So I can make this kind of like an orangey brownish color and if you want to use the same exact color I'm using the hex value for color B is going to be 9E, 7, 1, 3F. So now this mix result can go into the base color and I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now to make it look much more like marble we need to make it more shiny so I'm going to turn this roughness here to a 0.15 so it is much more shiny and then also let's add the subsurface so this subsurface here we can open this up and I'm going to turn the weight to 0.5 so now you can kind of see right there on the cat's ear there's just a little bit of subsurface. And then another thing I want to do is add the hue saturation value so we can easily adjust the hue. So let's go to the add menu I can search for the hue saturation value and we'll put this between the mix color and the principled shader. So now we have this hue here and so if I drag this around that's going to change the color hue you also have the saturation and the value if you want to change that but this hue here will change the colors so we'll be using this later in the custom node group. Now I also want to add just a tiny little bit of bump but want to be very subtle so let's click on this noise texture and I'm going to press ctrl shift d so ctrl shift d will duplicate the node but keep the wire plugged up. Now why I'm duplicating it is because I don't want it to be that rough because if it's that rough the detail is going to be so small it'll be kind of hard to see. So for this noise texture I can ctrl shift and select it to preview it I want to change the roughness down to a 0.65 instead so it's not quite as rough and then the noise texture factor can go into the normal to give it some bump and I'll ctrl shift and select the principled shader. Now there's some weird shading issues and that's because I need to convert the black and white data from the noise into normal data here that the shader can use. So I'll go to the add menu and let's search for a bump node and I'll put the bump node between the noise and the principled shader and the factor can go into the height value and that way it'll convert it to actual bump data but then it's way too bumpy and because this is a smooth marble material I want it to be very subtle so I'm going to turn the strength way down to like a 0.02 so it is very subtle. So that is it for the finished procedural material so I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group so it's more customizable and easier to control. So let's click and drag to box select all the nodes I'll press ctrl G to join it into a node group and you can hit the tab key with the node group selected to go in and out of the node group. So let's drag the node group over here and I can make it bigger and I can copy the material name and I'm going to paste the material name right in there so it is called wavy marble. I'll hit the tab key to go into the node group I'll hit the N key to open up the side panel you can click on the group tab and this will give you the interface settings. So I'm going to double click on this and I'll just rename this to shader because I like that better so outside of the node group it says shader. So let's go back into the node group. Now over here we have this group input and we can plug the values up to the group input to control them outside of the node group. So let's first take the scale and I can plug that into the group input but if I click on the scale here it's going to have three values and I just want one value to control the scale. So on the type here we're going to choose float instead and then on the default value we'll turn that to one and then if we go outside of the node group we want to turn the scale back to one. So now that can control the entire size of the material. So we'll go back into the node group. So I also want to control the noise scale and the wave scale so we'll drag this over here and we're going to take the noise scale we'll put that into the extra socket and the wave scale we'll put that into the extra socket and up here if you double click on this to rename them I'll rename this one to noise scale and I can rename this to wave scale or wavy scale whatever you want to call it. And then I want to add the colors so we'll drag the group input right over here and this one here this color is just a light color which is adding the wave so I'm not going to use that for the color but color A here we'll put that into the extra socket and color B and then also on this mix here color B and then if we click right here to rename them I'll rename this one to color 1 and then this one here will be color 2 and this one here color 3. Then I want to add the color hue so we have this hue value so we'll put this into the extra socket and I can double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to color hue and if you wanted to you could add the saturation which will make it more saturated or more black and white and also the value which will make it lighter and darker. I'm not going to add them but you could definitely add them to the custom node group if you wanted to. Then I want to add some of the detail values so we'll drag the group input down here by the waves and I want to plug the detail into the extra socket and also the distortion and also the roughness and I can double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to wave detail wave distortion and then the detail roughness I'll rename that to wave roughness and then I want to control the roughness of the material so let's drag this right down here we can put the roughness into the extra socket and then I want to control the bump strength so this bump strength here on the bump node we can put the strength into the extra socket and if I double click here to rename this I want to rename this to bump strength and then also I want to add the subsurface weight so we'll put the subsurface into the extra socket there and if I double click on this to rename it I like calling it subsurface scattering instead. Alright I'll hit the N key to close the side panel we can drag the group input right here on the very back and then I can hit the tab key to go outside the node group and here is the finished procedural material so let's just review the final material so we have the overall scale we also just have the noise scale and we just have the wave scale and then we have the different colors so we have colors one through three we also have the color hue which you can easily change the hue then we have some cool wave details so we have the detail also the distortion and also the roughness and by playing around with these values you can really get some different looking marble then we have the roughness of the material so you can make it a more scratched up or rough marble or you can make it a super polished and smooth marble and then we have the bump strength and then finally we have the subsurface scattering so that's going to be it for this tutorial so I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and thank you for watching and if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this finished procedural material you can get that on my gumroad store and my patreon page with the links in the description and if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials then definitely check out my ultimate blender procedural material pack which comes with all of my procedural materials pre-set up in the asset browser and I've created another 10 procedural materials so I've just released blender procedural material pack number 19 which come with all of these materials and all of these new materials have been added to my ultimate blender procedural material pack so all of my existing customers can re-download the product files to get the new updates with the new materials you can also purchase any of my materials individually on my gumroad store and to learn how to create any of my procedural materials you can check out my blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on youtube the links are all in the description but I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and thank you for watching"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnXvGknSWrs,Procedural Oxidized Bronze Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural oxidized bronze material using nodes and how to compile them into a custom node group for easier control. The tutorial covers various aspects of the material, including adjusting the scale, oxidation color and amount, detail levels, bronze colors, chunk size, roughness, and bump strengths. The creator also highlights additional resources for purchasing the material on Gumroad and Patreon, as well as a Blender course on creating a sci-fi construction robot. The video includes guidance on setting up the 3D scene, lighting, and camera in Blender for rendering the material.","In this blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural oxidized bronze material. So after we create the procedural nodes, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group so you can control the material. So I'll just review the material settings. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the material. Then we also have the oxidation color, so I kind of have this as a bluish greenish color, but you can change the color there. Then we also have the oxidation amount, so I can turn this up and down. So if I turn it way down, you can see there's just the base metal of the bronze, or if I turn it up, it can be very oxidized. And then we have some detail levels, so detail level one and detail level two for the oxidation. Then we have the bronze colors, so we have colors one and color two to change the colors of the base metal. Then we also have the chunk size, so if you want to make those chunks bigger, you can, or make them smaller. We also have the roughness of the metal, so you can make it very shiny if you want to, or you can make it more rough. And then we have some different bump strength, so we have the first bump strength and the second bump strength. And then we also have the chunks bump strength if you want to make those chunks go deeper. And if you'd like to purchase this material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. And if you'd like to purchase all of my materials, then definitely check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack. You can also purchase any of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, definitely check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. And then just one more thing before we continue, I wanted to let you know about my Blender course, my Sci-Fi Construction Robot. So that is an 11-part tutorial series where I show you step-by-step in real time how to create this sci-fi construction robot character. So the course covers the entire process, including modeling the character, doing the materials and the lighting, and even rigging the robot and rigging the treads, and then animating the robot and creating this finished animation. If you'd like to learn more about the course, you can watch the product trailer video with the link in the description, and you can also find the product pages with the links in the description. So I'll now show you my 3D setup if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I did. So I just went to the Add menu, and I added an icosphere, and then right after you add the icosphere right behind me down here in the corner, I turned the subdivisions up to 6, and then I shaded the object smooth with the Object Context menu. But the default objects in Blender are quite large. This object is larger than an average human using the real-life scale in Blender. So I'm going to scale this object down by 0.2 and hit Enter, and I'll press Ctrl-A and just apply the scale. So that is a better size. I'm also going to go to the Add menu, and I'm going to add a cylinder because I thought it would be nice to preview the material on a cylinder. And I'm going to scale the cylinder way down, and I'm going to move the cylinder over, and I could also rotate it a little bit. And I can go into Edit mode, and I can scale it up on the Z-axis a bit. I can also hold down the Alt key and select the loop here. Press Ctrl-B to add a bevel, and you can scroll your mouse wheel to make more cuts. Place that there. Select this loop, Ctrl-B to add a bevel. And then back in Object mode, you can use the Object Context menu to shade it smooth. Then I'm also going to press Ctrl-1 just to add a subdivision surface with one level. And because we scaled the object down, we're going to press Ctrl-A and apply the scale as well. So that's the new object's default size. Now, as for the lighting, I added in these four different area lights right here. And if you select the area light and go to the object data properties, this first area light is here on the back. And I set the power to 14, and I made it kind of a yellowy color to add kind of a rim light on the back. Then I have another area light right here. And for this one, I turned the shape to rectangle, and I turned up the Y size just to give it another rim light behind the objects. And then we have two lights here on the front. So this one here on the left side, I set the power to 140. And again, it's that slight yellow color. And then also I have the main light here, and this is coming from this side pointed down on the objects. And I have the power up to 200, and I made it quite large. Now, also to get some more realistic lighting or reflections, I added in this Artist Workshop HDRI. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. So the links will be in the description if you'd like to download it. And on polyhaven.com, I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. So after you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to color. You can choose environment texture, and this is on the world properties. And then once you choose environment texture, you can click on open, and you can open up the downloaded HDRI. And I also set the strength to 1.5, so it was a bit stronger. Now, as for the other render settings, I am using the Cycles rendering engine because I am going for realism. And then also, if you want to, you can open up the film tab, and you can checkmark the transparent button so that the HDRI is transparent in the background, but it'll still light the objects. And then also, if we go down here to the color management, I'm going to be using the view transform of filmic, and I'll set the look to very high contrast to pop out the colors and make things look more saturated. And then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera right at the objects. And over here on the object data properties of the camera settings, I did turn the focal length up to 80 just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit. So I'm in the shader editor, so I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mode, and I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll select the object, let's click on new to add a new material, and I'll call this oxidized bronze, and then I will put the material on both of the objects. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in the video to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on edit, and you can go to the preferences. And then over here in the add-ons tab, you can go to the search, and you can search for the Node Wrangler and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So we're going to start by creating the oxidation texture. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And with the noise texture selected, I'll press ctrl T, and that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler add-on, and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. What I can also do is hold down the ctrl and shift key and select different nodes, and that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler to preview the nodes on the object. Now I'm going to be using the object coordinates, so let's place the object into the vector of the mapping, and the object coordinates will place the textures on the object more evenly. Now I want to keep my nodes nicely organized, so I'm going to box select the mapping and texture coordinate. I'll press ctrl J to join them together into a frame, and with the frame selected, I'll press F2 to add a label, and I can call this mapping. And this is totally optional, but I'm just going to do this to keep the nodes nicely organized. So now let's change the noise texture settings. So I'm going to click on the FMB right here, and I'm going to change this to the multi-fractal instead, and then I'll turn the scale up to like an 18, and I'll turn the detail up to 15, and I'm also going to turn the roughness all the way up to 1, so it's very detailed. And I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now I want to make it more contrasty, so I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and we'll put the color ramp after the noise texture. And then we can change the color ramp settings, so I'm actually going to flip these values, so I'll drag the black tab over here, and then the white tab I'll drag kind of to about here in the center, so you can see it's very contrasty, and we now have a very detailed texture. Now later on when we create the custom node group, I'm going to want to control how much of the oxidation there is. So what I can do is go to the add menu, and I can search for the hue saturation value node, and I'll put this in between the noise texture and the color ramp. So we now have this value right here, and if I drag this up and down, this is making it lighter or darker, and so this is going to be used later on to control how much oxidation there is. So let's box select all these nodes, I'll press ctrl j to join them together into a frame, and I'll press f2 to add a label, and I'll rename that to oxidation. So I now want to create another group of textures, which is just going to be some noise. So what I'll do is go to the add menu, and I'm just going to search for another noise texture. Let's drop this here, and we want the same mapping vector. We want to put that into the vector so that it's using the object coordinates. Let's also click on the factor, and we're going to drag out, and then let go right here. And I'm going to search for a color ramp, so we'll go to the color ramp factor, and drop this here because I'm going to want to make it more contrasty. And let's ctrl shift and select to preview it. So now I can change the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to a 20, and I'll turn the detail to the max of 15, and I'll turn the roughness all the way up to 1. So it's pretty detailed. Then to make it more contrasty, we can use the color ramp. So I'm actually going to drag the black tab into the center, and then I'm going to drag the white tab over to the other side. But then if I click on the white tab, I want to make it less visible, so I'm going to make it kind of like a gray color. And if you want to use the same hex value that I'm using for this gray color here, then the hex value, it's going to be a hex value of b1 b1 b1. Let's box select these two nodes. I'll press ctrl j to join them together into a frame, and I'll add a label and just call this noise. So I now want to create another group of textures down here, which is going to be the chunks texture. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's drop it here. Let's drag the mapping down here, and I'll plug the vector into the vector of the Voronoi so that it's using the object coordinates. And I'm going to ctrl shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it. And let's change some of the settings. So I'm going to first change the scale, and I like a scale of 27. So you can see there's lots of dots there. However, I want to click on the f1 here, and I want to change it to smooth f1 so that the edges in between those circles there are nice and smooth. And then let's change the detail to the max of 15, so it's really detailed. And I can just leave the other settings how they are. So we're going to use all these little dark areas to make the chunks, but I want to make it more contrasty. So I'll go to the add menu. And again, we're going to search for a color ramp, and we'll put it after the Voronoi. And then I can just drag this white tab over to make it more contrasty. And I'll just drag the white tab to about there. Now later on, when we create the custom node group, I'm going to want to control the size of the chunks. So again, we can go to the add menu. And just like we did before, we can add a hue saturation value in between these two nodes. Now this value is going to make it lighter or darker. And so that's going to make the chunks bigger or smaller later on in the custom node group. So I'll box select these nodes, and I'll join them together into a frame. And I'll add a label, and I'm going to call this chunks. So now I'm going to add the different colors, and we're going to start to mix all three of the textures together. So I'll just drag these nodes out of the way for now. So I'll go to the add menu, and to mix the colors together, I'm going to add the mix color node. So we'll drop the mix color node right here. And we can use this to mix together the different groups of textures. So I'm first going to put this over here, and we're going to take the noise color, and we're going to put that into the factor of the mix. And I can control shift and select the mix to preview it. So then here in color A and color B, we can make the different colors. So for color A, I'm going to make this the main color of the bronze metal. So I'm going to make this kind of like an orangey dark colors. And then color B is going to be just like a gray color. And if you want to use the same colors I'm using for color A, the hex value is going to be 3A, 3, 2, 2D. And then color B is going to be a hex value of BC, BC, BC. So that's going to be the base color of the bronze metal. So now I want to mix in the oxidation. So we're going to take this mix, and I'll press shift to duplicate it, and we can drop it here after the first one. And the result is going to go into color B. So now we can take the oxidation texture, and we're going to put that into the factor, because the factor is determining what parts of the texture will be color A and what parts of the texture will be color B. So now it's going into the factor, color A, this is going to be the oxidation texture. So I'm going to make this kind of like a greenish bluish color. And the exact same color that I'll be using, the hex value for the oxidation is going to be 468882. So now that's really starting to look interesting. So now I also want to mix in the chunks, and I want the chunks to be the darker metal color. So I'll click on the mix, I'll press shift to duplicate it, drop it here. And then the chunks right here, the chunks color is going to go into the factor. And then this mix result is going to go into color A. And then for color B, that is going to be the dark color right here as the metal. So we can click and drag and drop the color here into the mix. And let's control shift and selected preview. Now there's a problem here. And that is that where the chunks are, you can only see the oxidation there. But then everywhere else, it's just this gray color. And that's because we need to change the light and dark values of the chunks texture. So to do that, I'll go to the add menu, and we're going to search for another color ramp, we can put the color up here in between the chunks and the mix. So stick it right here. And then we can actually flip these values. So I'm going to drag the white tab to about here, and the black tab, I'll drag over to about there. And what I'm also doing, if I control shift and select the color ramp, by dragging these really close together, I'm making the chunks really contrasty. So it's very dark, and then very light where the chunks are. So that is going into the factor. So we're basically telling it that wherever the white parts are, that is where color B is going to be. But then everywhere else where the black parts are, that is where the mix is going to be. So if I control shift and select the mix, you can see the chunks just look a bit darker. So now the mix result can go into the base color, the principled shader, and I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And then to make it look more like metal, let's turn the metallic up. So turn all the way up to one. And we can also turn the roughness down a bit to make it look more like metal. So that is looking pretty interesting. But I want to make a little bit of variation in the roughness. And then I also want to add a little bit of normal. And I want to add some bump, especially where the chunks are. First, I'm going to box like these nodes, and I'll join them together into a frame. And I will add a label to the frame. And I'll rename this to color. So now let's create the roughness map. And we'll add a bit of variation to the roughness. So I'll drag the principled shader over here. And I can take the mix result here. And I'm going to put that into the roughness. But then you can see it's really shiny. So to control that better, I can control the values. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. And we'll put the color ramp here between the roughness and the mix. So if I click on the black tab here, you can see if I make this lighter, it's going to make everything more rough. Or if it's darker, it's going to be more shiny. So I'm going to make this first one here kind of like a light gray. And then this one over here, I'll make it a dark gray. And the hex values that I'll be using are going to be B3, B3, B3 for the lighter one. And then the darker one is going to be a hex value of 5E, 5E, 5E. And then later on, when we create the custom node group, I want to be able to control the roughness. So an easy way to control the roughness is to just have a value which is going to make it lighter or darker. So to do this, we can just add a Hue Saturation Value node. And we'll put this after the color ramp. So now the value, we can drag this up and down to make it lighter or darker. So I'm going to join these together into a frame. And I'll add a label. And I'll call this roughness. Now, this metal material is very smooth. And so I want to make it very bumpy. And I especially want to add some bump to the chunks. So what I'm going to do is go to the Add menu. And I'm going to search for a bump node. Because whatever data is going into the normal, we need to use a bump node to convert it to bump data. So the first thing that I want to do is add the oxidation. So we're going to take the oxidation color ramp. We'll put the color into the height via the bump to convert it to bump data. And then the bump normal can go into the normal of the principal shader. So now you can see it looks really bumpy, but that's way too strong. So what I want to do is turn the strength way down to a 0.15. And then personally, I think that turning the invert on looks a bit better, so that it kind of looks like the oxidation is slightly above the other metal. So I like turning on the invert. Now I want to add a few more levels of detail or levels of bump. So I'm going to click on the bump node, I'll press Shift D to duplicate it and drop it here after this one. And then I'll press Shift D again to duplicate it and drop it here. So we can now add two more layers of bump. I'm also going to turn off the inverts on these ones because I don't want them inverted. So the next one that I want to add is some noise. So let's just take this noise color ramp here, and we'll put the color into the next height value of this bump. So now if I turn up the strength, you can see it's just going to add a bunch of noise over the metal. And for this one, I'm going to turn the strength value to a 0.05. So it is pretty subtle, but you can of course turn it up more if you want to. And then for the last one here, I want that to be the chunks. So let's take the chunks right here, I can click on this and drag it down. I want to take the color ramp of the chunks, and let's put that into the height value of this last bump. And now if I turn up the bump strength here, you can see the chunks look like they're going back inside the mesh. But I do want to make it more subtle. So I'll just turn the strength to like a 0.1. So the chunks are more subtle. And I'll select these nodes, I'll join them together into a frame, and I will add a label to the frame and just call it bump or you can also call it normal. So I'll now show you how to join this together into a custom node group. So I'm going to box select all the nodes except the material output. And I'll press Ctrl G to join it together into a node group, I can hit the tab key with the node group selected to go in and out of the node group. Let's drag the node group over here. And then I'm just going to make it a bit bigger. And then I want to have the same name as the material name. So I'll copy the material name, and I'll paste the material name right there. And then let's hit the tab key to go inside the node group. And I'll press the N key to open up this side panel. And if you click on the group tab here on the interface, we can rename all the different custom values. So here on the BSDF, I'm going to rename this to shader because I like that better. So you can see now it is called the shader outside of the node group. Now if you go over here to this side, we have this group input and we can plug all the custom values up to the group input. So this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures. So if we use the scale values, that'll change the size of the entire material. So we'll put the scale into the extra socket there. And then if I click on the scale, you can see that it's made up of three values, but I instead just want it to be one value. So let's click on the type here. We're going to change it to float instead, so it is one value. I'll now change the default value here back to one. And then if I hit tab to go out of the node group, we'll turn the scale back to one. So now you can actually see the material. And then let's go back into the node group. Now, the next value that I want to add is the oxidation color. So if you want to, you could duplicate the group input by pressing shift D and then plug the values up into it. And you could have multiple group inputs. I'm just going to move the group input around. So I'll drag the group input over here. And then you can take this color here, this bluish greenish color, that's the oxidation. And we're going to put that into color A. And then I will double click on this to rename it. And I'll rename it to oxidation color. And then I also need to press Alt P just to bring that out of the frame. And then I want to control the amount of oxidation. So this hue saturation value, this value here is going to make it lighter or darker. And so that's going to control the amount of oxidation. So we'll put the value into the extra socket here. And I can give it a name, and I'm going to call it oxidation amount. Then I want to control the detail levels of the oxidation. So I'm going to put the detail of the noise texture here into the extra socket, and also the roughness, put that into the extra socket. And I can rename this to oxidation detail one. And then this one, I'll rename to oxidation detail two. And then I want to control the bronze colors. So that's the base metal color. So I'll drag the group input over here. And we can take this dark brown color, we'll put that into the extra socket. And then this brown color over here, we can put this color into the same socket here as this color A here. And this way, this one single color will control both of the colors on the mixes here. And I'll rename this to bronze color one. And then the lighter color here that we can put into the extra socket. And this one we can rename to bronze color two. And then I want to be able to control the size of the chunks. So we'll drag this down over here to the chunks. And this value is going to make it lighter or darker. And so you can see that's going to make the chunks bigger or smaller. So we'll put the value into the extra socket. And I'll rename this to chunks size. And then I want to control the roughness and the bump. So we'll drag the group input right over here. And again, we have this value here, which is going to make the roughness lighter or darker. So that's controlling the roughness. So we'll put the value into the extra socket here. And I can rename this to roughness. And then I want to finally be able to control the three bump strengths. So I'll put the first bump strength into the extra socket, and the second bump strength into the extra socket. And I'll rename this to bump strength one and bump strength two. Now the last bump strength here, this one is controlling the chunks. So we'll put this one here into the extra socket. And this one I'm going to call chunks bump strength. All right, let's hit the N key to close the side panel, I'm just going to drag the group input right over here. And I'll hit the tab key to go outside of the new group. And we can now review the finished procedural material. So we have the scale to change the size of the entire material. Then we also just have the oxidation color. And then we also have the oxidation amount. So you can make it very subtle or make it really strong. We also have a few different detail levels for the oxidation. So if you want to have it be less detailed, you could, I like to keep the detail pretty high, but you could turn this down if you want to. And then we also have the bronze colors. So this is the base metal color underneath the oxidation. So the bronze color one and bronze color two. And then we have the chunk size. So if you want to make it look like it's really worn and chunky and rough, you could like turn that way up. Or you could make it really small. We also have the roughness of the material. So I could make this really rough if I want it to look super old. Or if I want to look a bit more shiny and polished, I could turn that down. And then we have a few different bump strengths. We can make it look really rough and bumpy with these bump strengths. And then finally have the chunks bump strength to make the chunks really bumpy. So that's going to be it for this tutorial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC0pyI7rR90,Easy Sci-Fi Metal Greeble Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a simple sci-fi metal greeble material using Voronoi and brick textures as the base. The tutorial is part of a larger course on creating a sci-fi construction robot, which includes 11 parts focusing on modeling, rigging, materials, lighting, animation, and rendering. The video explains how to customize the material with various parameters like scale, colors, edge thickness, roughness, and bump strength, and offers the material for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon. The tutorial aims to add detailed sci-fi textures to objects like spaceships or robots, and provides links to additional resources and the full course in the description.","In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create this easy sci-fi metal greeble material. Now, the base of this material is actually just created with two different nodes, this voronoi texture and brick texture, and we're going to be using that to create the base of the texture, but then I'll also show you how to create the complete material with all the metal details and kind of the noise on the metal surface. And this material is great to add to sci-fi objects that you want to add some surface detail, like a spaceship or a robot. Now, I originally created this material for my recently released course, my sci-fi construction robot. So that's an 11 part tutorial series where I show you step-by-step in real time, how to create this sci-fi construction robot animation. And in the tutorial series, we create this material here and we add it to the base of the robot to add some cool sci-fi details. So if you'd like to check out the sci-fi robot course, you can find the product links in the description, and you can also check out the trailer video with the link in the description. So we have the scale value, which you can change depending on the size of your object. Then we also have three different colors. And then this material comes with three different randomized values. So you can see that randomized one is kind of going to generate a random placement for all the little sci-fi details and bits. This is kind of like a seed value. Then we have randomized two. And so you can see if I scale this bigger, you can see there's just going to be a few squares here and there, or if I turn it way down, you can see it's super detailed and there's lots of edges. And then the randomized three is similar, but it kind of changes the placement of some of those dark plates. And then it's also going to add a bit more detail or less detail and kind of change the surface edge. And you can see if I turn the randomized three way down, you kind of give that cool look as well. That's a pretty cool sci-fi look with just little sci-fi bits and details on the metal. And here, right up on the screen are some different renders of some different variations that I've created. So just by changing the colors and changing the randomized values, you can really get lots of variations of this material. We also have this edge thickness value. And so this will change the size of those edges there on the little square pieces. And then we also have the roughness of the metal if you'd like to make it really shiny or really rough. And then we have the noise bump strength. So if you want to make the surface look really banged up and rough, you can turn that up. And then we also have the greeble bump strength, and that's just going to change the actual bump of those different little plates on the metal. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material, you can also get that over on my Gumroad store and Patreon page. The links are in the description. All right, so I'll now show you how I set up the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blender file the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu and I wanted to preview this on a sphere. So I'm going to add an icosphere. And then right behind me, once you have the icosphere, you can click on the add icosphere settings and I'll turn the subdivisions up to six. So the sphere is nice and round and smooth. And then I'll shade it smooth with the object context menu. Then I scaled this object down by 0.6. And then I pressed Ctrl A and just applied the scale. I also went to the add menu and I added a cube and I scaled the cube down by 0.5. And then also pressed Ctrl A and applied the scale. Then I went into edit mode. And with all the mesh selected, I can press Ctrl B to add a bevel and you can scroll your mouse wheel to make more edges on the bevel and then click to place that there. You can go back to object mode and then shade the object smooth with the object context menu. And then I just brought the cube over here and kind of centered them. Then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera at the objects. Now, as for the lighting, I added these two different area lights right here. And so I scaled the area lights up and I kind of placed them behind the objects. And so for this first one here, I turned the color to a blue color and I turned the power to 80. And then the second one here, I turned the color again to a blue color. And this one, I turned the power to 500. So if I hold down the Z button and go up into the rendered mode, you can see we have some nice lighting there and it'll give some nice blue reflections. And then also to get some realistic world lighting and reflections, I went over here to the world properties and I added in the blue photo studio HDRI. This is from polyhaven.com. The link will be in the description to this HDRI if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version on Polyhaven. So once you download the HDRI, you can click here on the yellow dot next to color and you can choose environment texture and then just open up the HDRI. And then just a few more settings to go over. Here on the render properties, if you scroll down and open up the film tab right here, you can check mark the transparent buttons that you can't see the HDRI in the world background, but it'll still light the scene. And then also here on the color management, I'm using the view transform of filmic and I set the look to very high contrast to pop out the colors and make the lighting look more contrasty and saturated. All right, so I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here and I'm in the rendered mode and I have the shader editor right over here. So let's just click on new to add a new material and we can rename it. And then we'll add the same material to both of the objects. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add-on in the tutorial. So to enable the node wrangler, you can click on edit and go to the preferences. And then over here on add-ons, you can go to the search and you can search for a node wrangler and you can just check mark the node wrangler add-on. So it's built into Blender and I'll show you how to use it in the video. Let's close Blender's user preferences. So the base of this material is actually really easy to create. We're just going to go to the add menu and we're going to search for a Voronoi texture. We're also going to go to the add menu and we're going to search for a brick texture. These are the two main nodes that we're going to use. Now, if I select the Voronoi texture, I'll press control T and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And then I want to use the object coordinates because the object coordinates will place the procedural textures on the objects more evenly. So let's put the object into the vector. All right. So now I can control shift and select the Voronoi texture and that is using the node wrangler. So the feature of the node wrangler is that you can hold down the control and shift key and then select different nodes and that'll preview it on the object. So let's change some of the settings for the Voronoi. So on the 3D here, I'm going to change this to the 4D. And then right here on the distance metric, let's change this to the Chebyshev. So you can now see that we have some little random squares with some edges. And then also this W value here, this is kind of going to randomize the texture. And I'm going to turn the W value to a 0.2, but you can of course change this later to randomize the texture. I'm going to keep all the other settings how they are, but let's control shift and select the brick texture and we can change some of these settings. So for the colors of the brick, I'm going to change this. However, you can change this later in the custom node group. But if you want to use the same colors that I'm using for color one, if you go here to the hex value, I'm using a value of a seven, a seven, a seven. So it's just kind of a light gray. And then here in color two, I'm using a hex value of five, nine, five, nine, five, nine. And then this mortar color here, this is going to be fully black. And then regarding the other settings, I just want to change the row height and I'm going to change the row height to nine. So now to really make this look like a sci-fi metal material, I want this foreigner texture to distort the placement of the brick texture because the vector values, the vector values are determining how the texture is placed on the object. So for example, if you wanted to use the UVS of an object, you could put the UVS into the vector and then that would tell it to use the UV map of the object. Well, we're using the object coordinates and that's going into the vector of this Voronoi, but we can now take the distance of this Voronoi and we can put that into the vector instead. So now this Voronoi texture is distorting the placement of the brick texture. And so we kind of have those little squares there from the Voronoi and that's distorting the bricks. So we now have some bricks, which are kind of distorted in the shape of the Voronoi texture. So we can take the color and we can put that into the base color of the shader and I can control shift and select the principle shader. Now, if you want it to look like a metal material, you can turn the metallic value all the way up to one. So it looks like metal. And then also to give it a bit more surface bump and to make it look a bit more detailed and interesting, we can also take the brick texture color and we can put that into the normal to give it some bump, but then to convert it to bump data, we need to go to the add menu and we need to add a bump node and we'll put the bump node here between the brick texture and the normal. And to convert the brick texture color data into normal data, we want to put the color into the height value. So now if you kind of zoom in here and look at the reflections, you can see the edges look kind of bumpy, but it is a bit too strong right now. So on this bump strength, I'll turn this down to like a 0.4. And then also to make it look a bit better, we can also take this roughness value, we can drag that down so that the metal is more shiny. Now, I do want to add a little bit of variation in the roughness so that some parts are a little bit more rough and other parts are a bit more shiny. So let's go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's put the noise texture underneath this Voronoi texture. And I want to use the object coordinates again. So we'll put the mapping vector into the vector of the noise. And I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Let's change some of the settings of the noise texture. So I'll turn the scale to four, also make it very detailed by turning the detail to 15. And this roughness, I'll turn that up to like a 0.6. So it has a little bit more detail. So now I can put the noise texture factor into the roughness to control how rough and shiny it is. And I'll control shift and select the principled shader. Now this metal is quite rough right now and I want to make it much more shiny. So to control that, we'll need to change the colors. So to do this, I'll go to the add menu and we're going to search for a color ramp. And we'll put the color ramp between the noise texture and the principled shader. And I can just kind of drag it up here. So now we can change the colors. So what I first want to do is make it a bit more contrasty by dragging the black tab over. And then if I click on the black tab here, if I make the colors lighter, it's going to be more rough. But if I want the metal to be more shiny, then I can click on this white color here and I can turn it down and it will be more reflective and shiny. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, then on this lighter tab here, this is going to be a hex value of C7, C8, C8. And then this other value is going to be like a dark gray. And this color is going to be 59, 59, 59 here in the hex value. So now that metal looks much more interesting because you can see there's little bits of roughness where you can kind of see the metal looks a bit dirty and it kind of adds some surface imperfections and makes it look more realistic. Now, I also want to add the noise texture into the bump, just to give it a little bit of surface bump. So I'll duplicate this bump node with shift D. We can put the normal into the normal. And now I can take the noise texture factor and we'll put that into the height value. So now the metal looks way too bumpy. So I'll turn the strength on this bump down to like a 0.02. So it is much more subtle. So it is a little bit hard to see, but if I kind of navigate over here to the reflections, you can see there's just a little bit of surface bump. And when we render the final scene and use more samples, you'll be able to see that better. But right now, the D noise is kind of smoothing out a little bit, but there's now just a little bit of surface bump on the metal. All right. So let's now turn this into a customizable node group to make it more useful. So I'm going to click and drag the box, select these nodes. I'll press control G to join them together into a node group, and then we can add up the custom values. First, let's hit the tab key. So with the node group selected, you can hit the tab key to go in and out of the node group. I'll drag the node group over here. Let's make it a bit bigger. And I can also take the same name and add it here into the node. So sci-fi metal greeble. Let's hit tab to go into the node group. And I'm going to hit the N key to open this side panel. And we can click here on group. And here on the interface, I'm going to just rename this to shader. So outside of the node group, you can see it says shader. Let's go back into the node group and we can now add up all the custom values. So I want to control the overall scale of the entire material. So this mapping node here is plugged up to all the textures. So this mapping scale can control the entire size of the material. So let's put the scale into the extra socket here. And then if I click on the scale, you can see right now it's going to be three values, but I just want to have one value to control the scale instead of having the X, Y, and Z as separate values. So on the type here, let's change this to float. And then here on the default value, we'll turn this to one. And then if I go outside of the node group, we can turn this scale back to one. So now that can control the overall scale. So let's go back into the node group. Now I also want to control the colors. So let's drag the group input right up here. And then I can take color one and put that into the extra socket, color two, put that into the extra socket and the mortar here, put that into the extra socket. And then I can just rename these. I'll just rename them to color one, color two, and color three. And then I want to add the randomized values. So the first value is going to be this W value because it's going to kind of change the seed and kind of randomize where the metal plates are. So let's put the W into the extra socket there. And then the second randomized value is going to be this brick width. You can see if I change the brick width, that's going to randomize the texture. So let's put this brick width here into the extra socket. And then for the third randomized value, I want to use the brick texture scale. You can see that's going to really make the texture look more random. So let's put the scale into the extra socket there. And then I can just rename these to randomize. That's going to be randomized one and then randomized two, and then also randomized three. Now, I also want to be able to control the edge thickness. So there's this mortar size here. So that'll change the edge thickness. So let's take the mortar size. We're going to put that into the extra socket there. And then if I double click on this to rename it, I'll rename this one to edge thickness. And then I want to be able to control the roughness of the material. So to create a custom value to control the lighter and darker colors of the roughness, we can go to the add menu and we can search for a hue saturation value. And we'll put this between the color ramp and the principle shader. And so now this value is going to make it lighter or darker. So the value will now control the roughness. So we'll put the value into the extra socket here. Let's double click on this and just call it roughness. And then I want to be able to control the bump strengths. So we'll drag the group input right down here. And this first one here, this is going to change the noise bump strength. So we'll put the strength into the extra socket. I can double click on this and rename it to noise bump strength. And then this one here is going to change the greeble bump strength. So we'll put this one into the extra socket. I can double click on this and rename this one to greeble bump strength. All right, I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. I'll drag this back over here, the group input. I'll hit tab to go outside of the node group. And there's the final material. So I'll just review the final material again. So we have the overall size, depending on the size of your object. We also have different custom colors you can change to make the metal look different. And also we have color three, which is kind of going to change those dark colors. So you could make it a different color if you want to, like red or blue or some other color, I'm going to make it black. And then we have these cool randomized values. And these can really be changed a lot. You can play around with these values to make the sci-fi greeble look very different. We also have this edge thickness. So if you want super thick edges, you could change that. And then we have the roughness of the metal to make it more rough or more shiny. And then we have the two different bump strengths. So that will finish it up for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed this and thank you for watching. And if you'd like to purchase this material and help support the channel, you can get that on my Gumroad store and Patreon page links are in the description. Now, this material was originally used for my recently released course, my sci-fi construction robot. And that course is an 11 part tutorial series where I show you step by step in real time, the complete process of how to create this sci-fi robot animation. So we do the modeling and the rigging and the materials and the lighting, and then we animate the robot and render that out to the final animation. So if you're interested in checking out the course, you can find the product links in the description. And also you can check out the product trailer video that'll finish it up for this video. So I hope you enjoyed this. I hope you found it helpful, and thank you for watching."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhiPLtOK4fg,Procedural Bronze Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor demonstrates how to create a procedural bronze material and organize it into a custom node group with adjustable parameters like size, metallic value, color, dirt amount, detail, roughness, and bump strength. The tutorial also covers setting up a 3D scene with appropriate lighting and importing models. Additionally, the instructor mentions various purchasable resources, including the procedural material on Gumroad and Patreon, an Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, and a newly released Sci-Fi Construction Robot tutorial course. Links to these resources are provided in the video description.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural bronze material. And after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group. So the custom node group has some different values to control the material. So we have the overall size of the entire material. Then we also have this metallic value if you don't want to have it be metallic. Then we also have the metal color, so you can make it a bit more yellow if you want to, or a bit more red. You could also change the brightness, or you could make it more and less saturated. I like this kind of color here, kind of like a reddish-orangey color for the bronze. Then we also have this dirt color. So this is a little bit hard to see right now, but you can change that dirt color. Now there's also a metal dirt amount. So if you turn this value up, you'll be able to see more of that dirt color. And then you can also change the dirt color. So this is kind of nice for making the material look a bit more dark or a bit more dirty. Then we also have the detail value of the material. Then we also have this lacunarity value. And the lacunarity is kind of going to add some little dots to the texture. So if I turn up this lacunarity, you can kind of see how there's more dots there. Or if you turn the lacunarity down, it looks more blobby. Then there's also the roughness of the metal. So you can make the metal really shiny, or you can make it more rough. And then we also have the bump strength if you want to make it look much more rough and bumpy. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material and help support the channel, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. The links are in the description. You can also check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials. And my Ultimate Procedural Material Pack has all of my procedural materials pre-set up for Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. You can also purchase my procedural material packs, which are packs of 10 procedural materials. And you can also learn how to create all of my procedural materials by checking out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist. Now, just one more thing before we jump into the video. I wanted to let you know about my newly released tutorial course, my Sci-Fi Construction Robot tutorial series. So it's an 11-part tutorial series where I show you how to create this animation here of this rigged construction robot. So the course covers the complete process, including modeling, materials, rigging, and animation to create this robot character. So if you'd like to check out the course, then you can find it with the product links in the description. Alright, so real quick, I'll show you my 3D setup if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu, and I went here to mesh, and just added an icosphere. And then right behind me, as soon as you add the icosphere, you can open up the add icosphere settings here. And I turned the subdivisions up to 6 so that it was nice and smooth. And then I closed those settings, and I used the object context menu to shade the object smooth. And then when modeling to the real life scale in Blender, the default objects are quite large. So I'm going to scale this object down by 0.2, hit enter, and I can press Ctrl A, and then apply the scale. So this is the object's new default size. Now I also added this really cool lion statue 3D model. And this is a free 3D model from Sketchfab, licensed as Creative Common Zero. So if you'd like to use this lion statue, I'll have the links in the description to where you can download this model on Sketchfab. So I downloaded the OBJ file. And then once you download the model from Sketchfab, you can click on file, you can click on import, and then you can import wavefront.obj. And then once you add the model, you'll have to scale the model way down because it is kind of large. And then I pressed Ctrl A and applied the scale so that the material size would be correct. And then also I added a subdivision surface modifier to the object just to give it a bit more detail and to kind of smooth out the edges. Then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And then I will hold down the Z button and move my mouse up into the rendered view to see this in the rendered mode. So for the lighting, I added these two area lights right here. So I added one big area light in the back. And this area light has a kind of a yellowish color. And I turned the power to 100. And then this other area light is kind of on the top going down. And for this color, it's pretty much just a white color, but it's slightly yellow. And I turned the power to 500. And then also to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections, I added in this Aerodynamics Workshop 1K HDRI. This is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Link will be in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. So when you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to color. You can choose environment texture and then just click on the open button and open up the HDRI. And then just a few more settings. If I go up here to the render properties, I'm using the cycles rendering engine, but you could also use Eevee if you want to. And then also if you open up the film tab right here, I turned on the transparent background. And then also if you open up the color management right down here, I'm using the view transform of filmic and I changed the look to high contrast just to make the colors look a bit more contrasty and saturated. All right. So I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here and I'm going to go into the rendered viewport mode. And then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll click on the objects. We'll click on new material and I can just rename this to bronze. And then you can also add the same bronze material to the other object. So I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences and in Blender's user preferences, if you go to add-ons, you can go here to the search and you can search for Node Wrangler and just enable the Node Wrangler add-on and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So let's close Blender's user preferences. So for the base texture, I'm going to go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's drop the Voronoi here and with the Voronoi texture selected, I'll press control T and that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler add-on and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I want to use the object coordinates because the object coordinates are going to place the procedural textures on the objects more evenly. So let's put the object into the vector and then I can control shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it and let's change some of the settings. So on this value right here, this distance metric, I want to change this to the Chebyshev and then let's turn the scale up. So I'll turn the scale up to like a 20. I want to make it very detailed, so I'll turn the detail to the max of 15 and this roughness here, I'm going to turn it down a little bit to like a 0.45 and this lacunarity value, I'm going to turn that up to like a three. So just turn it up a little bit. You can see that lacunarity value is kind of going to break up the texture and add some cool little dots and kind of speckles to the texture. Now I want to mix the Voronoi with a noise texture just to add some more noise. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's drop the noise texture right down here and then I want to use the same object coordinates. So let's put the mapping into the vector of the noise texture and I can control shift and select the noise texture preview it. Let's change some of the settings in the noise texture. So I want to turn the scale to 40 so I can see that better. Let's also make it really detailed, so I'll turn the detail to the max of 15 and we can also turn the roughness up to make it a bit more detailed. So I'll turn the roughness up to like a 0.65 and this lacunarity, I also want to turn this up just a little bit, so I'll turn it up to three. So to keep my nodes really nicely organized, I'm going to click and drag to box select these nodes here and I'll press ctrl j to join them together into a frame. The frames are totally optional but I just like to use them to keep my nodes nicely organized. So I can drag the frame around and it will move the nodes. I can also select the frame and then press f2 to add a label and I'm going to call this mapping. All right, so now I want to mix the voronoi and the noise texture together. So to mix the two colors of the textures together, I can go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a mix color. Let's add the mix color node and drop this here. And the voronoi distance, that's going to go into color b and I can ctrl shift and select the mix to preview it. And then the noise texture factor, that is going to go into color a. Now the factor, this is going to blend between only using one of the textures or only the other. So you can see we're only using the noise at zero and we're only using the voronoi at one. So I want to change the factor to a 0.27, so that's kind of a nice mix in between them. So I can click and drag to box select these nodes. I'll press ctrl j to join them together into a frame just to keep them nicely organized. And I can press f2 to add a label and I'm going to call this textures. So now I want to add these textures into the base color. So let's take the result and I can put that into the base color and I can ctrl shift and select the principled shader. Now that doesn't really look like bronze, so I want to change the colors. Before I change the colors though, I do want to make the texture more contrasty. So I'll go to the add menu and let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp and we'll put the color ramp in between the mix and the principled shader. So if I drag the black tab over, you can see now everything is going to be more contrasty. So I'll drag the black tab over there. So you can see these little dark areas, that's where the dirt is going to be. So we can make the bronze material look more dirty if we want to. So now let's make the colors. So to make the colors be customizable, I can go to the add menu and we can search for the mix color and we'll put the mix color after the color ramp. Now the color ramp here, this can go into the factor. And so now instead of using a single factor slider, the black and white values of this texture are going to determine what parts will be color A and what parts will be color B. So for color A here, I want this to be the bronze color. So I'm going to make it kind of like an orangey yellow color. And then for color B, this is going to be the dirt color. And so I made this very dark and also made it kind of an orange color. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, you can click on the colors and go to the hex values. And for the bronze color, you can punch in a hex value of C1 704B. And then here for color B, you can go to the hex value and you can punch in 160D09. So let's control shift and select the principled shader that's using the feature of the node wrangler to control shift and select different nodes. And we can now preview that material. So it still doesn't look like bronze and that's because it isn't metallic. So let's turn the metallic value all the way up to one and now it is acting like metal. Now to make it look even more like bronze, I'm going to turn this roughness value way down. And so now it looks like a really shiny metal. Now later on in the custom node group, I want to be able to control how much dirt there is. And so I want to be able to control this slider here to make it like more contrasty and be able to see more of the dirt. So to do this, I can go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a hue saturation value. And we'll put the hue saturation value in between the color ramp and the mix color. So the hue saturation value has this value to make the colors lighter or darker. So we can use that later in the custom node group to make the bronze material more dirty. So let's click and drag the box, select all these nodes. I'll press control J to join it together into a frame. If I select the frame and press F2, I can just rename this to like base color. Now I also want to add some variation in the roughness so that some parts are more rough and other parts are more shiny. So let's take this mix color and I can put that into the roughness. Now to control that better, I want to go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's put the color ramp here in the wire between the mix and the roughness. So stick it here. I'll just drag it down. So if the values are lighter, it's going to be more rough. But if the values are darker, they're going to be more shiny. You can see if this white tab is all the way dark, it's super reflective and it looks like a mirror. So for the white tab here, I'm going to make this kind of just like a mid gray color. And then for the dark color here, I'm going to drag this out a little bit so it's a little bit more sharp. And then this black color, I'll make it just a little bit brighter and the hex values that I'll be using for this color ramp. If I go here to this darker gray, this is going to be a hex value of 3A, 3A, 3A. And this lighter color here, this light gray, this will be a hex value of B9, B9, B9. Now again, later in the tutorial when we create the custom node group, I want to be able to control the roughness. So if we make the values lighter or darker, that's going to control the roughness. So I can again search for a hue saturation value node and let's put that here after the color ramp. So now this value is going to make the texture lighter and darker so that can easily control the roughness. So let's click and drag the box, select these nodes and I'll join them together into a frame and I'll add a label and I'll just call this roughness because these nodes are controlling the roughness. And then finally, I want to add just a tiny little bit of surface bump. So if I zoom in here close to the material, I just want to add a tiny little bit of bump on the surface. So what I can do is take this mix result and I can put this into the normal of the shader. Now you can see there's some weird shading issues and it looks all messed up and weird. And that is because we need to convert the color data into normal data that the shader can use. So I'll go to the add menu and we're going to search for the bump node and we're going to put the bump node here in between the mix and the normal. So stick it here and I can drag the bump down and then to actually convert it to bump data, we want the mix result to be going into the height value of the bump. So now you can see the bronze looks really rough. It kind of looks like a really rough battered metal. And so to make that less strong, I can turn the strength value way down and I'll turn it down to like 8.03. So now if you zoom in really close, you can see there's just a subtle little bump on the surface. It is pretty subtle, but you can kind of see it right there. If you control shift and select the bump. And so that's just going to add like a subtle bump over the material. So that is it for the procedural bronze material. But I'll now show you how to join this together into a custom node group so it's easier to use and to change the values. So let's click and drag the box, select all the nodes except the material output and you can press control G. That'll join it together into a node group. Now if you have the node group selected, you can hit the tab key to go in and out of the node group. So I'll drag the node group over here. Let's drag it out to make it bigger and I can just rename it to bronze. And then I will hit the tab key to go into the node group. So I'll press the N key to open up the side panel here. And on this interface, if you click here on group, I want to double click on the interface and I'll rename that to shader. So outside of the node group you can see it now says shader. So I'll go back into the node group. Now let's go over here to this group input and we can plug values up to the group input and then that way we'll be able to control those values outside of the node group. So I first want to be able to control the overall scale of the material. So this mapping node here is plugged up to all the textures. So this scale can change the size of the entire material. So let's put the scale into the extra socket there. And then to make it one value instead of three values, I want to click here on the scale and we're going to click on the type here and we're going to change it to float. So it is one value. And then this default value, we need to change this to one. And then if we hit tab to go out of the node group, we need to turn the scale back to one. So now let's go into the node group. Now I also want to control the metallic. So let's drag the group input right over here. And we can take the metallic value and put that into the extra socket. And then I also want to be able to control the colors. So let's put a into the extra socket there. And then also be put that to the extra socket there. And I can double click on these to rename them. And I want to rename this one to metal color. And this one here, I'll rename this to dirt color, then I want to control the amount of dirt. So this value here, if I drag this, it's going to make more dirt or less dirt. So let's put the value into the extra socket here. And I can click on this and just rename it to dirt amount, then I want to be able to control the detail and lack of narrative. So I'll drag the group input back down here. And let's put the detail of both of these textures into the same socket. So we'll put the detail in there. And then also the detail of this one, we'll put that in there. So now this detail is being plugged up to both textures. So this detail will control both detail levels of both textures at once. And we'll do the same thing for the lack of narrative. So put the lack of narrative into the extra socket, and the lack of narrative here into the extra socket. And then I want to be able to control the roughness of the material. So we have this hue saturation value, which can make it lighter or darker. So let's plug the value into the extra socket here, I can double click on this, and I'll rename it to roughness. And then I want to also be able to control the bump strength. So let's drag the group input right down here. And we'll put the strength into the extra socket, I can double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename it to bump strength. Alright, let's click on the group input. And I'll just drag it here kind of behind the material, I'll hit the N key to close the side panel, and I'll hit the tab key to go outside of the node group. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the texture. So you can change this depending on the size of your object. You can also change the metallic value if you want to make it less metallic, then you can also change the metal color. So you could make it kind of less saturated or more saturated, you can make it more yellow or more of a red color. Then we also have the dirt color. So you can just change that dirt. We also have this dirt amount if you want to be a bit more dirty and kind of look a bit darker. We also have the detail of the metal and the lackinarity of the metal. We also have the roughness value so you can make the metal really shiny or you can make it more rough. And then we also have the bump strength to change that surface bump. So that's going to wrap it up for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed this, I hope you found it helpful, and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTfPLzVvM9I,Procedural Icy Snow Material ❄️ (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on creating a procedural icy snow material in Blender, which is later organized into a custom node group for easy adjustments. The tutorial covers manipulating various aspects of the material, such as overall scale, ice and snow balance, color customization, ice texture details, noise settings, subsurface scattering, roughness, and displacement. Additionally, the tutorial explains setting up the 3D scene with appropriate lighting and rendering settings using Cycles, offering viewers the option to purchase the procedural material or explore other materials and tutorials via provided links.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural icy snow material. And then after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group. So we first have the overall scale to change the size of the entire material. Then we also have this ice and snow factor. So if I want more snow, I can turn this up. Or if I want more ice, I can turn that down. Or I can just kind of leave it in the middle and you can see there are some little patchy areas where there's ice and then other parts where there's snow. Then we have the different colors here. So we have color one, which can kind of be like a blue color to make it look more icy and make it look more like frozen water. And then we also have color two, which is just going to be kind of a light color. And I made it slightly blue. Then we also have just the ice scale. So I can change just that icy texture. Then we have the ice detail value. And then we have some noise settings like the noise scale. And then we also have this noise detail. Then we have the subsurface scattering. So this allows just a little bit of light to go through the ice. So I just turn this up to a 0.3 to make it look a bit more like ice. And then we have the roughness of the material. So it's very shiny right now, but you could make it more rough if you wanted to. And then we have the bump strength just to change that surface bump. And then we also have the displacement strength to change the size of the displacement. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and Patreon page with the links in the description. And if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials, you can check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack. You can also purchase all of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist. All the links are in the description. Alright, so real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu, I went here to mesh, and I just added an icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click on the little add icosphere settings right after you add the icosphere, I'm going to turn the subdivisions up to like a 6 so it's nice and smooth and round and it has lots of detail. And then I'll close the add icosphere settings. And I want lots of geometry because I'm going to be using the displacements to actually pop out the mesh. And then I want to scale this down so it's better size for modeling to the real life scale in Blender, because the default objects are quite large. So I will scale this object down, so hit S to scale, I'll type in like 0.2, and then enter. And then I'll use the object context menu and shade it smooth. And then I'm also going to press Ctrl A, and I'm just going to apply the scale, so this is the object's new default size. Then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the object. And if you select the camera, and then if you go right over here to the side panel and go to the object data properties of the camera, I turned the focal length to 80 just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit. And then also here on the output properties, I set the X and Y resolution the same so it is a square image. I also added a few different area lights right here, so I added one big area light right up here, and then another smaller area light right over here. And with both of these area lights, if you select the area light and go over here to the object data properties, I turned the power up to 60 and just left them at a white color. Now also to get some more nice lighting and reflections, over here on the world properties, I added in this HDRI. This is from polyhaven.com. I'll have a link in the description if you'd like to download it. And on polyhaven.com, I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. So then once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot next to color, and you can choose the environment texture, and then click on the open button and open up the HDRI. And then I turned the strength of the HDRI to 0.5 so it's just half as strong. So this is going to give some nice lighting and reflections in the 3D scene. And then if you want to make the world background transparent, just so that you can't see it in the background, then you can go right up here to the render properties, you can open up the film tab, and you can check mark the transparent button. So it'll still light the scene, but you won't be able to see it in the background. You can also go down here to the color management, and I'm going to use the view transform of filmic and the look to very high contrast to pop out the colors and make things more saturated and contrasty. And then I'm also going to be using the Cycles rendering engine because I am going to be using the material displacements. If you want to use Eevee, you can, but the material displacements will not work in Blender Eevee. So let's just select the object here, and then I went over here to the shading workspace. So in the shading workspace, I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mode, and then I have the shader editor right over here. So let's click on new here to add a new material, and I can just rename the material to icy snow. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on edit, you can go to the preferences, and then you can go right over here to the add-ons. And here on the search, you can type in node, and you can just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on. So it's built in a Blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. We can close Blender's user preferences. So to create the icy texture, I'm going to start by going to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's drop the Voronoi here, and then to use the Node Wrangler, you can hold down the control and shift key and then select different nodes. And that is going to preview the node on the object. Also with the Voronoi texture selected, I'm going to press control T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And I want to use the object coordinates because the object coordinates will place the texture on the objects more evenly. So we'll put the object into the vector. And then we can change some of the Voronoi texture settings. So this F1 here, I'm going to change to smooth F1, and that's going to smooth out those edges. You can see whereas before with F1, there's kind of those sharp edges there, but changing it to smooth F1 will smooth it out. And there is a smoothness here, but I'm going to leave the smoothness value at 1. And then let's also change some more of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale of 16 so you can see more of them. And then I'll turn the detail up to the max of 15 so that it's quite detailed. And then this lacanarity value, I'm going to turn this up to 50. And by turning it up, if you zoom in here, you can see there's a bunch of little dots on the texture. And that'll help to give it kind of that icy snowy look. Now I want to put a texture into the roughness to tell it what parts are going to be more rough and what parts are going to be less rough to kind of add some variation. So I'm going to click and drag the box, select these nodes and drag them back. I can now go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's put it here. And then again, I want to use the object coordinates. So let's put the vector into the vector of the noise texture and I can control shift and select the noise texture preview it. And let's change some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 40 and then I'll turn the detail level to the max of 15. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. So I'm going to use this noise texture and I'm going to put it into the roughness to tell some parts to be more rough and other parts to be less rough. So the factor can go into the roughness and I can control shift and select the Voronoi. And now you can see that texture is much more interesting. However, I do want to control those values a little bit better. So I'll go to the add menu and we're going to search for a color ramp and we're going to put the color ramp in between both of these textures here. So if I drag the black tab over here, you can see that less of these areas are going to be detailed or less of the areas are going to be rough. And then if I drag this back and drag the white tab over, you can see it's going to be very detailed. So what I'm going to do is just drag this black tab over just a little bit, kind of to about here, and then leave this where it is. So this way there's even more variation because some parts are more detailed and other parts are less detailed. Alright, so we can now plug this Voronoi texture into the principled shader. So first let's take the distance and I'm going to plug that into the normal. And then to convert this to proper normal data, I need to go to the add menu and we'll search for a bump node and we'll stick this in between the Voronoi and the principled shader. And I can control shift and select the principled shader. And the distance needs to be going into the height value and that way the bump node will convert it to bump data. And then it is too strong and I want it to be much less strong, so I'll turn the strength just down to like a 0.2. There's just a little bit of bump over the entire material. And then also this roughness here, because this is icy snow, I want it to be very shiny. So I'll turn the roughness to zero. Then this distance, we can also plug this into the base color to give it a little bit of variation in the colors. But I want to change the colors. I want it to be kind of like a white and blue color, not white and black. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for the mix color and let's drop the mix color after the Voronoi, but before the principled shader. And the distance value can go into the factor. So now this Voronoi texture is going into the factor, so it's determining what parts are going to be color A and what parts are going to be color B. So for color A here, I'm going to make this fully white and then I'll just make it a little bit blue. And then color B, I'll also make this fully white, but I'll just make it a tiny bit blue. And if you want to use the exact same colors that I'm using, you can use the hex values. So for color A, if I go here to the hex value, color A is going to be a hex value of BF, E4, FF. And then color B here, this is going to be a hex value of E5, F7, FF. Now right now the whole thing kind of looks like snow, but I want to make some parts look like ice. And icy is a bit transparent. You can see through it, it kind of acts like glass. So I'm going to open up this transmission here. We can turn up this transmission to make it look more like glass or ice. Now I don't want the entire thing to look like ice. I just want some parts here and there to look like the ice. So we're going to take the Voronoi distance and we're going to put that into the transmission weight. But then I want to control that better. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a color ramp so we can control the colors. And let's put the color ramp here after the Voronoi, but before that transmission weight, and just drag it down here. So you can see right now this part looks more like snow, but then there are some areas where it looks more like ice. But we can now change the colors to control that a bit better. So I'm going to drag the black tab over here and the white tab over here. So I'm basically going to flip both of the values. So the white tab is now over here, and I'm going to drag the white tab over here. You can see if I drag it over more, more of it is going to look like ice. But if I drag the black tab over, more of it is going to look like snow. So I'll drag the white tab over here and then leave the black tab there. And then also on this white tab, instead of it being fully white, I'm going to make it a little bit darker. And if you want to use the same hex value, you can punch in D7, D7, D7. So it's basically going to be a very, very light gray. And later on in the custom node group, I want to be able to control how much is ice and how much is snow. So we can just control the light and dark values of this color ramp. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for the hue saturation value, and we'll put this here before the color ramp. So this hue saturation value has a value, and this is going to make it lighter or darker. So I can just drag these values and you can see it'll be more like snow if I turn it up or more ice if I turn it down. So we'll be using that later in the custom node group. And then also I want to add some subsurface scattering just to make it look a bit more like soft snow. So let's go here to the subsurface and I'm going to turn the weight to just like a 0.3. I think that is good for what I'm doing. So now I want to add some values into the displacement to actually make the material bumpy, but I don't want to add this Voronoi texture into the displacement because this Voronoi texture is way too detailed and it has all those little dots there with the lack of airity. So I'm going to select the Voronoi and I'm going to press control shift D. So control shift D will duplicate the node, but it'll keep the wires plugged up and I'll just drop it down here and then I can control shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. We can change some of the settings. So this scale here, I'm going to turn this up to like a 20 and then also the detail. I want to turn this down because I don't want the displacement to be super detailed. I want it to be a bit more lumpy. So I'll turn the detail to just like a 2. And this lack of airity, I'll turn that to 0 because I don't want any lack of airity. So now this Voronoi texture distance, we can plug this all the way over here to the displacement and I can control shift and select the principled shader. Now you can see it's not actually popping out of the mesh. That's because we need to go here to the side panel. So I'll open up the side panel and I'm going to go here to the material and we're going to scroll all the way down and we're going to go to this setting tab. So open up the setting and then here under surface, we want to change the displacement type to displacement and bump. And this is telling the material that it can use the displacements. And also if you're using the Eevee rendering engine, the material displacements won't work. So if you want to use the material displacements, make sure you're using cycles. Now you can see the materials jetting off to the side and that's because we need to convert the black and white data of the Voronoi texture into displacement data. So I'll go to the add menu and we're going to search for the displacement node and we'll drop this here in the wire and then I can just drag this down here. Now this distance value from the Voronoi, this needs to be going into the height value of the displacement and that'll actually convert it to proper displacement data. Now you can see it's still way too strong, so if I just turn this strength value way down, now it's much less strong. And specifically I'm going to use a displacement value of 0.01. So now it's just a little bit bumpy there on the edges. Alright and that is it for the procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So I can click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output and then I can press ctrl g. Ctrl g will join it together into a node group and with the node group selected you can hit the tab key to go in and out of the node group. So let's go out of the node group and I can drag this over here. Let's also drag it out to make it a bit bigger and then here I want to make it the same name as the material so I'll just add the name there icy snow and then I will go back into the node group. Now if I press the n key to open up the side panel here you can see there's the interface and there's the displacement and there's also the bsdf. I'm going to double click on this and I'm going to rename it to shader because I like that better. So if you hit the tab key to go outside of the node group you can see it just says shader. Let's hit tab to go back into the node group. Now if we go over here to this group input we can plug values up to the group input and then we'll be able to control those values outside of the node. So I first want to be able to control the overall size of the entire material so we can take this scale value here from the mapping and this scale value is plugged up to all the textures so this will change all of the textures at once so it'll change the entire size of the material. So we'll put the scale into the extra socket there and then if you click here on scale right now it's going to be three values but I just want it to be one value so let's click on the type here and I can change it to float instead and that way it'll just be one value and then here on the default value I need to turn this to one. I also need to hit the tab key to go out of the node group and then this scale here I need to turn that to one. All right let's go back into the node. Now I also want to be able to control the ice and snow factor so let's drag the group input over here and this hue saturation value this value here is going to make it more icy or more snowy so we'll put the value into the extra socket here and I can double click on this on the side panel to rename it and I'm going to rename it to ice and snow factor just to control that and then I want to be able to control the colors so let's take the group input and we can drag it up here and then on this mix here we have the two different colors so we'll put A into the extra socket there and then B we'll put that into the extra socket here and I can double click on these to rename them and I'll rename this one to color one and this one here I'll just rename that to color two or you could rename it like ice color and snow color if you wanted to. So now I want to control the ice scale and the ice detail so that's going to be these values here on this base voronoi texture so I'll put the scale into the extra socket here and the detail also put that into the extra socket and I can double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to ice scale and this one here I'll rename that to ice detail and then I also want to control these noise texture settings so let's drag the group input right down here and I want to put the scale into the extra socket and the same thing so the detail into the extra socket there and then I can just double click on these and I'll just add the word noise to the starting so you know what they are so noise scale and we'll call this one noise detail and then I want to control the subsurface scattering so we can go here to the subsurface and we can take this weight we can drag this all the way over here and we can stick it right here into the extra socket and then you can see right now it says subsurface weight I'm going to double click on this and rename it to subsurface scattering instead so there we go subsurface scattering then I want to control the roughness of the material so let's just drag this over here next to the principles shader and this roughness we can put that into the extra socket there to control the roughness and then I also want to control the bump strength so let's drag this back here behind the bump and we can take this strength value from the bump and we can put that into the extra socket here I can double click on this and rename it to bump strength and then I also want to control the displacement strength so let's drag the group input down here and we have this displacement scale value so we'll put that into the extra socket and I can double click on this and I can rename it to displacement strength all right so I'll drag the group input right back over here I can hit the tab key to go out of the node group and I'll hit the n key to close the side panel we can now just review the final material so we have the overall scale then we have this really cool ice and snow factor so if I want very snowy or very icy I can just control that very easily with that value then I have the different colors so one color is more blue and then another color is a bit more white but you could make it more blue if you want to and then we also have the ice scale and we also have the ice detail then we also have some noise settings so we have the noise scale and then we also have the noise detail then we have the subsurface scattering if you want to add more of that then we have the roughness of the material if you want to be really shiny or more rough then we also have the surface bump strength and then finally we have the displacement strength to actually pop out the mesh so that'll be it for this tutorial so I hope you enjoyed this I hope you found it helpful and thank you for watching and if you'd like to purchase this finished procedural material you can get that on my gumroad store and also my patreon page and to purchase all of my materials you can check out my ultimate blender procedural material pack which comes with all of my procedural materials pre-set up for blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails sorted catalogs and customizable node groups and you can also purchase all of my materials individually on my gumroad store and to learn how to create any of my procedural materials you can check out my blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on youtube all the links are in the description but I hope you found this helpful and thank you for watching"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78fay5ZVACs,Procedural Grippy Knurled Metal Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural grippy metal material inspired by workout equipment. The tutorial covers creating the material with adjustable features such as scale, color, grip texture, noise, and bump strength. It also includes guidance on organizing the material into a custom node group for easy application on different objects. Additional resources and materials are available for purchase on the creator's Gumroad store and Patreon page, with links provided in the video description. The tutorial is part of a larger series on Blender procedural materials.","In this blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural grippy metal material. Now I had the idea to create this material because I was working out and I was using some workout equipment and some dumbbells and on the handles they have this cool grippy metal so you can grip the metal better. And also a little while back I actually made a dumbbell weights tutorial so if you'd like to check out that video I'll have the link in the description. But in this tutorial we'll be creating this grippy metal material that you can add to different objects and after we create the procedural material I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group. So we first have the overall scale to change the size of the entire material and then we also have this base color here so you can just change the color of the metal make it lighter or darker and then we also have this grip scale so you can change the scale of that grip texture. Then we have the grip sharpness so if I just zoom in here and then change the grip sharpness you can see if I turn it up you can see the grippy parts are going to be sharper and kind of come out more. And then we also have the squares size so I can make those squares really small or make them quite big. Then we also have the noise scale which is just that little subtle noise on the metal. And then we also have the noise detail and the noise roughness. And then we also just have this roughness value to change the shininess of the metal. And then we have the grip bump strength if you want to have that grip pop out more. And then we also just have the noise bump strength if you want to make that metal look like it's a bit more worn out. And if you'd like to purchase this material you can get that on my Gumroad store and Patreon page. And to purchase all of my procedural materials definitely check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack which comes with all of my procedural materials pre-set up for Blender's Asset Browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. So once you set up my Ultimate Material Pack in Blender's Asset Browser you can just drag and drop all the materials into your 3D scenes. You can also purchase all of my materials individually on my Gumroad store. And to learn how to create any of my procedural materials definitely check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist. The links are all in the description. So real quick I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu and I just added an icosphere. And then right behind me if you click on the little add icosphere settings I turned the subdivisions up to six so it is nice and smooth. And then using the object context menu I shaded the object smooth. Then I also wanted to add this to a cylinder object so you can see what it looks like on a metal bar. So I added a cylinder object and I went into edit mode and I scaled the cylinder up on the z-axis a bit. And then I also added some loop cuts by pressing ctrl r. I added a loop cut here and a loop cut down here. And then I also went here to the face select. I select this face. I hit the i key to inset the face. And then also down here hit the i key to inset the face. And then I went back to object mode. And then we can also use the object context menu and shade that smooth. So now you can see we can shade it smooth and the edges are smooth there because of those loop cuts. And then also I pressed ctrl 1 to add a subdivision surface modifier with one level. And again you can see by adding the loop cuts there it makes the edges sharp. And also I would add a few more loop cuts just to make that a little bit sharper there on the top and bottom. So then in object mode I move these objects over and I also wanted to scale them down to a better size. So I scaled them down to like a 0.3. And then I pressed ctrl a and just applied the scale. And then this object here I'll scale it down even more. Press ctrl a and apply the scale. And I'll just put these in the center of the scene. And then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera at the objects. Now for the lighting I added these two different area lights right here. So if you go to the add menu you can go down here to light and add an area light. And so this first one here I put it kind of on the back to give a rim light. And I set the power to 10. And I also changed the shape to rectangle and I made it longer. So if I go into the rendered view just to kind of see how that's looking. It is kind of subtle it's hard to see here in this shot. But there is a subtle rim light in the back of those objects. And you'll be able to see it better when the objects are more shiny. And then I also added another light here. This one I set the power to 30 and I just left it at a square. And just kind of pointed it down to give some nice bright lighting on the objects. Now also to get some nice realistic lighting reflections if you go over here to the world properties. I added in this Machineshop 02 HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Link is in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1k HDR version of this HDRI. So once you download the HDRI you can click on the yellow dot next to color. You can choose environment texture. And then you can click on the open button and open up the HDRI. And I also just set the power to 0.8. So it's a little bit less bright. Now also if you go over here to the render properties. I am using the Cycles rendering engine. But you could definitely use Eevee if you want to. But I'm going for realism so I'll use Cycles. And then also if you open up the film tab here. You can choose the transparent button if you want to set the background to transparent. So that the background isn't quite as distracting. And then also if you open up the color management. I'm going to use the view transform of filmic and the look to very high contrast. To pop out the colors and make everything more contrasty and saturated. So I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3d viewport right over here. And I'm in the rendered mode. Just so I can preview the material. And right over here I have the shader editor. So I'll just click on new to add a new material. And I can just rename this to grippy metal. And then also I can click and drag right here. And I can drop the material onto this object as well. Or just add that material. So they both have the same material. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add-on in the video to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the node wrangler enabled. You can click on edit. You can go to the preferences. And then over here in the add-ons tab. If you go to the search. You can search for node wrangler. And just check mark the node wrangler add-on. So the add-on is built in a blender. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So we can just close blender's user preferences. So let's now start by creating the material. So I'll go to the add menu. And for the base texture. I'm going to search for a brick texture. And then let's also ctrl shift and select the bricks texture. Just to preview it. Now before we change the settings of the brick texture. You can see it's not placed on the objects very well. And so I'm going to do a few things to fix that. So I'm going to select the brick texture. And I'm going to press ctrl t. That is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now usually with procedural materials. I like to use the object coordinates. Because the object coordinates place the texture on the object more evenly. However for this brick texture. The object coordinates really isn't going to work that well. Because it'll only work well on one face. But then the other faces you can see it'll be stretched. So I'm instead going to be using the uvs of the object. And then we'll be uv unwrapping the object. So that you can actually see the texture really well on all the object. So this icosphere that we added on default is already pretty well uv unwrapped. You can kind of see the texture all over. But this object here. I do want to uv unwrap this. So I'm just going to go back to solid view. And then I will go into edit mode. So I'm now going to add some seams to the object. So I'll click here to go to the vertex select. I'm going to hold down the alt key. And just select that loop right there on the end. And then I'll go down here to the bottom. And I'll shift alt select that loop right there. Then I can just find one of these spots. So I'm actually going to do it on the back. So you can't see the seam. And I'll hold down the shift key. And I'll select that one. And that one. So those vertices. And I'll also hold down the shift key. And select those two. So basically we have a cut around the bottom. Then we have a cut going up. And then we have a cut around the top. So we can cut out the mesh. And open it up. And that'll be a great way to uv unwrap it. So right now. Because we have all those selected. We can hit the u button. And we can click on mark seam. So now you can see that those spots are red. Because they have seams. And then if you select everything again. You can hit u. And let's just click on unwrap. Now real quick. I'm going to show you the uv unwrap. So if I go back to previous. Real quick. I'm going to go here to the uv editing workspace. And you can see this is how it's looking. So the bottom and the top. And also all of the edges are all opened up. So that is going to be a nice uv unwrap. Let's go back to the shading. And I can go into the rendered viewport mode. Just to see how that is looking. And so now we can change some of the brick texture settings. So the scale here. I'm going to turn this to 60. So there are a lot more of them. And then I want to make color 1 and color 2 the same color. So I'm just going to click and drag. And I'm going to drop color 1 onto color 2. And then the mortar here. I'll leave to black. Now right here on the mortar size. I want to make this bigger. So I'll turn it to like a 0.3. So it is bigger. But then this mortar smoothness value. If I click here to make it bigger. I'll turn the mortar smoothness to like a 1. So you can see that better. And then this brick width and row height. I want them to be the same. So I'll turn this bottom one here to a 0.5. So that the row height is 0.5. So if I zoom in here. You can see they're all the same size. And then also this offset here. I don't want any offset. So I'll turn the offset to 1. So now it's kind of just like this checker texture. Now I want to make this more contrasty. So I'll go to the add menu. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. We'll put the color ramp here after the brick texture. Now if we drag the white tab or the black tab together. That is going to make it more contrasty. So we'll be using this in a moment. But I first want to show you what it's actually going to do. So I want to put this into the bump. So that it actually makes the texture look bumpy. So we can take the color ramp color. And let's put that into the normal. And then I can control shift and select the principle shader. Now you can see there's some weird shading issues. And that's because we need to convert the color ramp data into normal data. So we'll go to the add menu. And we're going to search for the bump node. And let's put it here between the color ramp and the principle shader. And we want the color ramp color to be going into the height value. And that way it'll convert it to bump data. So you can see it looks very bumpy now. So now I can change the color ramp and show you what it does. So you can see by dragging the color ramp. It's going to make it more contrasty. And so we can actually control how that's going to look. So I'm going to drag this white tab over here to kind of flatten the top parts. And then I'll drag this black tab over here to kind of make the squares smaller. So that is looking quite nice. And then also, I want to change a few more settings. So I want to make it metallic. So we'll turn the metallic value to one. So it looks like metal. And then also here on the base color, let's just kind of make this a light gray color. So something like that. And also this roughness value for now, I'm just going to turn it way down with a bit more shiny, so that you can see it better. And it looks more like metal. So that's definitely looking like metal now, because it is shiny. Now there is a problem with this. And that is that the squares are not diagonal. So to fix this, we're going to go back to the mapping, and we're just going to rotate the texture. So here on this mapping, I'm going to take the z value, and I'm going to rotate it. So I'm actually going to type in 45 to rotate it by 45 degrees. And now you can see that it's actually rotated over. And so it kind of looks like that grippy metal on some workout equipment. So now I also just want to add some overall noise to the texture, because if I zoom way in, you can see it's quite shiny. And it doesn't really look very realistic, because it's kind of too perfect. So I want to add a bit of noise to the texture. So I'll go to the Add menu, we're going to search for a noise texture. And let's put this here underneath the brick texture. And then we can take the texture coordinate, and we actually want to use the object coordinates. So we'll put the object into the vector, the noise texture. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And also later on in the video, I'm going to want to change the overall scale of the noise. So let's take this mapping, I'll press Shift to duplicate it, and we can drop it down here. But then this z value, we can just turn that back to zero, because we don't need to rotate it. So now let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I'll turn the scale to like a 60. And let's turn the detail to 15. So it's very detailed. And the roughness, I'll turn that up to like a point seven. So it's nice and detailed. So now I want to put this noise texture into the bump as well. So to add it in, we can duplicate this bump node with Shift D and drop it here. And the normal can actually go into the normal. So this way, we now have this height value that we can add data into. And that way we can mix multiple bump maps together. So let's put the factor into the height value. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select the principled shader. Now it's way too strong right now. So this first bump strength, which is controlling the noise, let's turn that down to like a point one. So now if I zoom in really closely, you can see there's some subtle bump there. And then also this bump is a bit too strong as well. So I'm going to turn this way down to like a point two five. So it is less strong. And that is looking much, much better. Now I also want a little bit of variation in the roughness so that some parts are more rough and other parts are more shiny. So let's take the noise texture factor and I can put that into the roughness. Now I want to control that better because it's actually a bit too rough right now. So we'll select the color ramp, we'll press Shift D to duplicate it, and we can drop it here after this roughness. So after the noise, but before the roughness value. And let's just drag this out so that we have a bit more space. And then with the color ramp selected, I can hit the backspace to reset the color ramp. Now if I make the color ramp values lighter, it'll be more rough. Or if I make the color ramp colors darker, that's going to make it more shiny. So I just want to have these both be kind of like a mid gray color. So this color here, I'm going to make it kind of like a light gray, something like that. But in this white color here, I'm going to make this one kind of like a dark gray. And if you want to use the same hex values that I'm using to get the same color, then on this first one here, you can go to the hex value, and you can punch in A9, A9, A9. And then here on the second one, this one is slightly darker just to give it a bit of variation. This one is going to be 949494. Now later on in the custom node group, I want to be able to control the roughness values. So we can just make the values lighter or darker to control the roughness. So to do this, we're going to go to the add menu, and we're going to search for the hue saturation value. And let's put this here after the color ramp, but before the roughness. So now this value here will make the entire thing lighter or darker, and so that can control the roughness. All right, and that is it for the procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So I'm going to click and drag to box, select all the nodes except the material output, and I'll press control G. Control G will join it together into a node group, and I can hit the tab key with the node group selected to go in and out of the node group. So let's drag the group input right over here, and I can drag it out to make it bigger. And then I can also give it the same name, so I'm going to call it grippy metal. So now it's called grippy metal, and then I'll hit tab to go into the node group. I can hit the N key to open the side panel, and I can double click on the interface here. If you go to the group tab, double click on the interface, and I'm going to rename this to shader. So now if I go outside of the node group, you can see it's just called shader, and I like that a bit better. So let's go back into the node group. So if we go over here to the left side, we have this group input, and we can plug values up to the group input, and then we can control those values outside of the node group. So the first values that I want to control is the overall size of the material, and both of these mapping nodes are controlling the scale. So I want to put this scale value here into the extra socket here on the group input, and then this mapping here, I want to put the scale value into the same exact socket. And this way, this one single value will control both of the scale values. Now if you click on the scale here, you can see it's three values, but I just want it to be one value. So on the type here, let's change it to float, so it is one value. And then on the default value here, we'll turn that to one. And then you still can't see the texture, that's because we need to go outside of the node group, and we need to turn the scale back to one. Alright, so let's go back into the node group. Now I'm also going to drag the group input way over here, and we have this base color here, so I'll put the base color into the extra socket so we can control that. And then I also want to control the grip scale. So if we drag this back over here to the brick texture, the brick texture has a scale value, so that'll just control the grip. So I'll put the scale into the extra socket here. I can click on this and rename it to grip scale there on the side panel. And then I want to control the sharpness of the grip. So if I zoom way in here so you can kind of see that better, this mortar size here, I can make it bigger or smaller to make that bigger. So let's take the mortar size, and we'll put that into the extra socket. And I'm going to rename this one to grip sharpness. Now we can also use this mortar smooth value to change the size of those bricks, or in this case, it's going to be the grips. So I'll take the mortar smooth and put that into the extra socket, and I'll rename this to square size. Then I want to control some of the noise settings. So I'll drag this down here, and let's put the scale into the extra socket, and also the detail into the extra socket, and the roughness into the extra socket. And then I'm going to double click on these and just add the word noise to them. So noise scale and noise detail, also noise roughness, just so we have more control over that. And then I want to control the roughness of the material. So we'll drag the input back up here, and this hue saturation value will make it lighter or darker, so that'll control the roughness. So I'll put the value into the extra socket, double click on this, and I'll rename it to roughness. And then I finally want to be able to control the bump strength. So let's drag this group input down here. So this first one here, this bump strength is going to change the noise. So we'll put the strength into the extra socket, double click on this, and I can rename it to noise bump strength. And then this one here, that is going to change the bump strength of the grip. So I'll put the strength into the extra socket, and I can rename this to grip bump strength. All right, let's drag the group input way back over here, I can hit the tab key to go outside of the node group, and hit the N key to close the side panel. Let me just zoom out here. And we can now review the final material. So we have the overall size of the material. And then we also have the base color. So you can make whatever metal color you want. We also have the grip scale, we also have the grip sharpness. And actually, if you turn the grip sharpness up a lot, that actually looks pretty cool. That's kind of like a variation of the grippy metal. And then we also have the square size. So that's pretty cool as well. We also have some noise settings to the noise scale and the detail and roughness. And then we also have the roughness of the material to make it more shiny or make it more rough. And then we have the noise bump strength if you want to make it look really worn and old. And then also the grip bump strength. That's going to be it for this tutorial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnpkH9USZvs,Procedural Rock Shader (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor demonstrates how to create a procedural rock material. This video is a continuation of a previous tutorial on creating a rock generator using geometry nodes, and viewers are encouraged to watch the earlier video for a comprehensive understanding. The tutorial covers various customizable aspects of the material, such as scaling, color adjustments, edge lightness, noise details, and bump strength. The instructor also provides a guide on organizing nodes and creating a custom node group for easier manipulation of the material properties. Additionally, the video includes tips on lighting and rendering settings to enhance the realism of the rock material, recommending the use of the Cycles rendering engine for optimal results. The tutorial concludes with information on purchasing the procedural material and related resources.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural rock material. Now this tutorial is actually the second part in my rock generator geometry nodes tutorial, so if you'd like to go ahead and watch that tutorial and learn how to create a geometry nodes rock generator, you can find the link to that tutorial in the description. So in this video, I'm going to be creating this procedural rock material, and we're going to be adding that to the rock. So this material has many customizable values like the overall scale of the material. We also have some different colors for the rock, so color one and two, and right now they're gray colors. But for example, if you wanted it to be more like a brown rock, you could just change these colors and make it kind of like a brown color. And then there's also this edge lightness, and so that's going to be that lightness there on the edges of the rock. So I could maybe make this like a brown color as well. And one thing to note about the edge lightness is that it will not work in the EV rendering engine. So if you're using the EV rendering engine, you just won't be able to see the edge lightness. So I would recommend using cycles. And then there's also this noise detail to change the detail of that noise. There's also this noise roughness value. And then there is the roughness of the material. So you could make it very shiny if you want the rock to look kind of wet or shiny. And then we have the noise bump scale. So that is just the noise of the actual bump there, which is going into the normal. And then we have the noise bump strength. And then we also have the detailed bump strength to give it some really small detail. And then you can see right over here on this side panel, this is the Geometry Nodes rock generator, which I created in the previous tutorial. Again, link is in the description if you'd like to check out that video. But there's some different settings like the random shape and the rock edge size and the edge crease just to change the look of the rock. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase the material, or if you'd also like to purchase the Geometry Nodes rock generator, then you can find the product links in the description. And if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials, then you can definitely check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack. And to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, definitely check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist. All the links are in the description. Alright, so I've opened up my rock generator Geometry Nodes Blender file. And I'm first going to show you a few more things that I've done to the 3D viewport, like the lighting and things like that. So here in the 3D scene, obviously I have my rock generator. And you can learn how to create this rock by watching the tutorial. Now I also added this sunlight here to get some nice lighting. So I added the sunlight and kind of pointed it over in this direction. And I set the strength to 6 of this sunlight. And then also to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections, over here on the world properties, I added in this Autumn Field 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. And then also I am going to be using the Cycles rendering engine. So over here on the render properties, I'm using Cycles because I am going for realism. And then if you want to make the world background transparent, then you can go right down here to the film tab. And you can check mark this transparent button. And that way the world lighting will still light the scene, but it'll just be transparent so it's not quite as distracting. And then also you can open up the color management here. And I changed the view transform of filmic. And I made the look very high contrast to pop out the colors and make everything more contrasty and saturated. All right, so I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here. And I'm in the rendered mode. And then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll just click on new to add a new material. And I'll just rename this to procedural rock material. And then I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on edit and go to the preferences. And in the user preferences, if you go over here to add-ons and go to the search, you can search for the Node Wrangler and just enable the Node Wrangler. So it's built in a blender. And I'll show you how to use the Node Wrangler add-on in the video. So I want to start by adding some noise to the material. So I'll go to the add menu. And I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's drop the noise texture here. And with the noise texture selected, I can press control T. And that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And then let's also control shift and select the noise texture. And that's going to use the Node Wrangler. So if you control shift and select different nodes, that'll preview the nodes on the object. So now we can see the noise texture. Now I want to use the object coordinates, because the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. So let's put the object into the vector of the mapping. And then we can change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale pretty high to like a 55. And I'll turn the detail to the max of 15. And then this roughness here, I'll turn to like a 0.8, because I do want a bit more roughness. Now I want to make this a bit more contrasty. So I'll go to the add menu. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And we'll put that after the noise texture. So I can now drag the white tab and the black tab together. And you can see if they are closer, everything's going to be more contrasty. So I'll drag the black tab to about there and the white tab to about there. So you can see how that texture is looking. Now I also want to add another noise texture. So let's select the noise texture and the color ramp. And I'm going to bring them down. And then I can press Ctrl Shift D. Ctrl Shift D will duplicate the nodes, but keep the wires plugged up. And I can Ctrl Shift and select this color ramp to preview it. And then let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I'll turn the scale to like a 10. And then I'll leave the detail at 15 and the roughness to 0.8. But I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now I do want to change the color ramp. So I'm going to drag the black tab over a bit, because I want more of the black values. So I'll drag the black tab to about there and the white tab to about there. So now you can see we have another texture. So we have both of these textures, but I want to mix them together. So I'm going to drag these nodes back. And to mix them together, I can go to the add menu. And I can search for a mix color node. And let's just stick this here. So I want this top color ramp to go into color B. And then this bottom color ramp, that color is going to go into A. Now if we drag the factor, that is going to blend between both of them. And I'm going to turn the factor to like 8.7, so that you can kind of see both of them and they're mixed together. So now I want to create the different colors for the actual texture. So I'm going to duplicate the mix with shift D. And I can drop it here after this one. And then this mix result, that can go into the factor. And the factor will determine what parts of the material will be color A and what parts will be color B. So I can now make the colors for A and B. So for color A, I'm going to make this a very, very dark gray color. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using, you can click on the color. And you can go to the hex value. And you can punch in 2 six times. And then for color B, this is going to be fully black. So now you can see we have a nice dark texture there for the ROM. Now I like to keep my nodes nicely organized. So I'm going to box select all these nodes. I'll press control J to join them together into a frame. And the frame is just a nice way to organize the nodes. And I can press F2 to add a label. And I'm just going to call this noise. And then I can also box select these here. These two nodes, the texture coordinate and the mapping. I can press control J to join them together into a frame. And I can press F2 to add a label. And I'll just call this mapping. Just to keep the nodes really nicely organized. And this here is going to be the base color. Now I also want to create that edge lightness. Because I want the edges to kind of be a bit lighter. And it really pops out the rock and makes the rock look better. So to do this, I'll go to the add menu. And I'm going to search for the geometry node. So let's drop this here. And then we can also go to the add menu. And we can search for a color ramp to make the geometry more contrasty. So I can control shift and select the color ramp to preview it. And then we can take the pointiness value. And we'll put this into the color ramp. Now you can see here on the edges, the edges look a little bit lighter. And to see that better, let's drag these values together. So they're more contrasty. Now two things to know about the geometry pointiness value. Is that if you are in the solid view or the material preview. You won't be able to see the pointiness value. And also if you're using Blender Eevee, the pointiness value won't work. So you need to make sure you're in the rendered mode. And also make sure you're using Cycles Render to preview the pointiness value. So I'm going to drag the black tab kind of to about here. And then the white tab to about there. So the whiteness or the lightness is mostly just on those edges. But it's okay if there's a little bit kind of on the surface. Now I want to make this look a bit more random and noisy. So I'm going to go to the add menu. And I'm going to search for another noise texture. Let's drop this up here. And then I want to use the same object coordinates. So plug the vector of the mapping into the vector of the noise texture. And then we can take this color ramp. We can press shift D to duplicate it to make it more contrasty. And let's plug the factor into the vector of the color ramp. And I can control shift and select the color ramp to preview it. So we can now change the settings of the noise texture. So the scale I'm going to turn to like a 9.5. Let's also make it very detailed. So I'll turn the detail to the max of 15. And the roughness I'll turn to like a 0.63. So there's more roughness. And I'll leave the other settings how they are. So we now have these two textures. And I want to mix them together. And I want to make this noise make the light edges a bit more noisy. So to do that, I'll go to the add menu. And I'm going to search for a mix color node. So we can mix colors together. Let's drop this here. And I want the top one to actually be going into color B. And then this bottom color ramp, that can go into color A. And I can control shift and select the mix to preview it. Now I'm going to click on the mix here. And I'm going to change this to the linear light. So right down here, just choose the linear light. And then I can drag the factor around to blend it together. And I'm going to turn the factor to like a 0.4. Now it's not really looking that great right now. And that is because this noise texture is way too contrasty. So I'm going to drag this out so it's less contrasty. And also I'll drag the white tab a bit. Something like that. So now you can see there's just a bit of noise here. And they're kind of mixed in with those light areas. So I can box select these nodes here. I can join them together into a frame. And I can add a label to the frame. And I can call this edge lightness. So I now want to mix the edge lightness into the base color. So to do that, I'm going to duplicate this mix node. And then I'll control shift and select it to preview it. Now this original mix here, this result is going to go into color A. And I can control shift and select the mix to preview it. And then for the factor, that's going to be the linear light. Because the factor is going to determine what parts are going to be A and what parts are going to be B. And so the light and black values are going to determine those colors. So we're going to use this as a mask. So we'll put the result into the factor. And then again, control shift and select the mix to preview it. So now color B, this is going to be the color of the light edges. So I can make this kind of like a light gray. And if you want to use the same light gray color that I'm using for those edges, on color B, the hex value is going to be 59 5959. All right, so I can box select these nodes and join them together into a frame. And I can add a label. And I'm going to call these base color. Again, just to keep the nodes nicely organized. Because these two nodes are controlling the base color. So let's drag these nodes back here. And because this is the base color, we can put the result into the base color. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now I also want to change the roughness, because you can see this rock is way too shiny right now. But I want there to be some difference in the roughness, so that some parts are more rough and other parts are more shiny. So we're going to take the noise mix. Let's take the result and we can put that into the roughness. But I want to be able to control how rough it is overall, because it still looks a bit too shiny. So I'll go to the add menu and we're going to search for a color ramp. And let's put the color ramp between the mix and the roughness. So just stick it there. And then I can change some of the settings. So for this color ramp, if the values are lighter, they're going to be more rough. But if they're darker, they're going to be more shiny. So rock is usually pretty rough, unless it's wet. So I'm going to make this a very light gray here, here on the color ramp. So it is more rough. And if you want to use the same light color I'm using, the hex value will be D3, D3, D3. And then this other color and color here, that's just going to be fully white. Now, later on in the custom node group, I want to be able to control the roughness. So we can change the light and dark values to control the roughness. So if I just go to the add menu and search for the hue saturation value, I can drop this here after the color ramp. And this value is going to make it lighter or darker. So that'll control the roughness. So let's box select these nodes and we'll join them together into a frame. And then I can add a label and we'll just call this roughness. Now, if you look closely at the rock, you can see it's kind of smooth and it doesn't look very bumpy. And so I want to add some surface bump. So to do that, I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for another noise texture. So let's drop the noise texture here. And then I want to use the same mapping because I want to use the object coordinates. So we'll take the mapping vector and we'll put that into the vector of the noise texture. And I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And let's change the different settings. So I'm going to turn the scale up to like a 10 and we'll turn the detail to the max of 15. But then the other settings, I'll keep how they are. So we can now take the factor and we can put that into the normal to give us some surface bump. And I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now you can see there's some weird shading issues. And that is because we need to convert the black and white data into normal data that the shader can use. So to do this, we'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for a bump node. And we'll stick the bump node here after the noise texture. And then we want the factor to actually be going into the height value to convert it to bump data. So now you can see the rock looks very bumpy, but it is a bit too strong right now. So let's turn the bump strength down to like a 0.2. So it's not quite as bumpy. Now I want to add another layer of bump. And that is going to be a more detailed bump from this noise. So we can select the bump node. We can press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here. So the normal is going through the normal. So we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. And that is how we can mix multiple bump maps together. So let's take this mix result and I can put that into the height value of the bump. And then I can control shift and select it to preview it. You can see that is what it's doing. So here's the first one. And then here's the second one. And this one, let's turn the strength up to like a 0.3. So it's a bit stronger. So I can control shift and select the principled shader. And now if I zoom in here, you can see there is a nice level of detail there on the surface bump. All right. And that is it for the procedural material. So I'm now going to show you how to join this material together into a custom node group. So let's box select all the nodes except the material output. And I can press control G to join it together into a node group. Now if I press the tab key with the node group selected, that is going to go in and out of the node group. So let's drag the node group over here to the material output. And I can drag it out to make it bigger. And then if I copy the procedural rock material name, I can paste it here in the node group. So let's hit the tab key to go into the node group. And if you press the N key to open up the side panel, you can click here in group. And there's going to be the interface here with the BSDF. Now I want to double click on this. And I want to rename it to shader because I think shader is better. So now if we go outside of the node group, you can see it's just called a shader. So let's go back into the node group. And if I go over here to the left side, we have this group input. And we can plug values up to the group input. And then that way, we'll be able to control those values outside of the node group. So the first value that I want to control is the overall size of the material. So this mapping node is plugged up to all of the textures. And so we can add the scale value into the extra socket. And then it'll control the scale. So we'll put the scale into the extra socket. Now if you click on the scale here, you can see that it is three different values. But I instead just want to have one value to control the scale. So let's click on the type here. And we're going to change it to float instead. And float is going to make it one single value. Now we need to turn the default value back to one. And then if we go outside of the node group, we need to turn this scale back to one. And that will now control the size of the material. So let's go back into the node group. Now the next values that I want to control are the colors. So let's take the group input. And I can drag it way over here above the base color. And we have these different colors here. So we'll put A into the extra socket and B into the extra socket. And then here I can double click on these to rename these. And I'm going to rename this one to rock color one. And then this one here, color B, that is going to be rock color two. And then this mix here, that is going to be the edge lightness. So we'll put B into the extra socket here. And I can double click on this to rename it. And I can rename it to edge lightness. Let's select the group input. And I can drag it way back here down underneath these noise. So for the noise here, we have these detail levels and the roughness values. And I want to be able to control those outside of the node group. So we'll put the detail into the extra socket. And then this detail here, we can actually put this into the same exact socket. So because they're going into the same socket, this one socket will control both detail levels. And then I'll double click on this to rename it. And I'll rename it to noise detail. And I want to do the same thing for the roughness. So I'll put the roughness into the extra socket there. And then this noise roughness, put that into the same exact socket. And I can double click on this and I'll rename it to noise roughness. And then I want to control the roughness of the material. So let's drag the group input way over here. Actually, just drag it kind of down here. And here we have the roughness. And this value here is going to make it lighter or darker. So that'll control the roughness. So I'll put the value into the extra socket here. And I can just rename this to roughness. And then finally, I want to control the bump strengths. First, I want to box select these nodes and join them together into a frame with Ctrl J. And I can press F2 to add a label. And I'll just call that bump. So we have this strength value here. And that's just like the noise bump strength. So we'll put the strength into the extra socket there. And then I can double click on this. And I'll rename this one to noise bump strength. And then I also want to control the noise bump scale. So that is this scale value here. So let's put the scale into the extra socket. And then this one I can rename to noise bump scale. And then I actually want the noise bump scale to be above this one. So I can just click and drag and then drop it here. And that'll put it above it. And then the last one that I want to control is this bump strength here. So we'll put this strength into the extra socket there. And then if I double click on this to rename it, I want to rename it to detailed bump strength. All right, let's select the group input. And I can drag it back here. I can press the Tab key to go outside of the node group. And I'll hit the N key to close the side panel. Let's make this bigger. And we can now review the final material. So we have the overall scale of the material. And then we also have the different colors for the rocks. So rock color one and two. And then we also have that edge lightness. And then we have the noise detail. We also have the noise roughness. We also have the roughness of the material. So if you want the rock to look kind of shiny and wet, you could turn that down. We also have the noise bump scale. And then we also have the noise bump strength. And then finally, the detailed bump strength. So that's going to wrap it up for this tutorial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewq69iNRdmQ,Procedural Scratched Metal Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural scratched metal material. The tutorial covers creating the material, organizing it into a custom node group for easy control over aspects like scale, metallic value, color variations, noise size, and scratch details. The instructor also showcases how to apply the texture to 3D objects and adjust lighting for realistic rendering. Viewers are informed about purchasing the material and other resources from the creator's Gumroad store and Patreon, and are encouraged to explore additional procedural material tutorials available on YouTube.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural scratched metal material. So after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group so that you can control the look of the material. So we first have the overall scale to change the size of the entire material. And then we have this metallic value if you want it to look less metallic or more metallic. And then we have two different colors for the metal. So we have metal color one, and then we also have this other color for the metal, metal color two. Then we have the noise scale. So if you just want to change the size of the noise, maybe make the noise really small, you could change that. And then we have the scratches scale. So if I zoom way into this object here, kind of to the reflections, you can see there's these little scratches, you can especially see right there. So this scratches scale is going to make the scratches much smaller or much bigger. And then we also have the scratches color. So if you want to make the scratches really dark, you can see that's where the scratches are. So I don't know if I make them really well if I make them really light colored, but I'm just going to have them like a mid gray color. And then we have the roughness of the metal. So if you want really shiny metal or really rough metal, you can change that. And then we have the metal bump strength. So this is just the overall bump of the material. And then we have the scratches bump strength. So if you want the scratches to be much more bumpy, you can turn that up there.

All the links are in the description. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport. If you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. So I went to the add menu and I added an icosphere, just because I want to preview this material on a sphere. And then right after you add the icosphere, if you click right behind me on that little add icosphere settings, just open this up, I'm going to turn the subdivisions up to six, so it is nice and smooth and round. And I'll close the add icosphere settings, and I can use the object context menu and shade the object smooth. Then I also thought it would be cool to add this object to a cylinder. So I'm going to add this to a cylinder, but of course you can add it to whatever object you want. And I'm going to move the cylinder over, and then I'm going to go into edit mode, and I'm going to add some loop cuts to the cylinder. So you can press control R to add loop cuts, and I'm going to add some loop cuts there. And then also if I go to the face select, I'll select this face and I'll press I to inset that face. So there's another loop there, and then select the bottom face and inset that as well. So if you go back to object mode now, you can press control two. Control two is going to give it a subdivision surface modifier. And so you can see by adding the loop cuts there, it is just nice and smooth there on the edges. And then we can shade that object smooth as well. And then both of these objects, I scaled them down to like a .2, so hit enter. And then also this object, I might scale it down just a little bit more. And why I'm scaling them down is because the default objects in Blender are kind of large. They're a bit larger than an average human, so I'm scaling this down to a much better size for the material. And let's just bring this over here. And then I need to press control A and just apply the scale. So these are the object's new default size. And then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. Now for the lighting, if you go right over here to the world properties, I added in this Dam Bridge 1K HDRI. This is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. The link will be in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. So once you download the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to color, and you can choose environment texture and then just open up the HDRI. And this will give some nice realistic lighting and reflections in the 3D scene. So if I go into the camera view, you can kind of see that lighting. Now also I added these different area lights right here to get some nice lighting. So I added this bright area light here, and this is just shining kind of on the front. And I set the power to 40 and just have it as a white color, kind of for a main light. And then all of these lights back here, these ones I set the power to 10, and then made them kind of like a yellowish color, so they kind of add a yellow rim light to the edges. So you can see by adding the lights there, there kind of is like a yellow tint there on the metal. So I added one there, I also added another one here, and also one here, and then also one here on the bottom, kind of adding a nice yellow light there to that cylinder object. Now if you want to make the world background transparent so that you can't see the world in the background, you can go here to the render properties, and you can open up the film tab, and you can just checkmark the transparent button, so that way you can't see the world in the background, but it will still light the 3D scene. And then also, if you want to make the colors look nicer, I am using the view transform of filmic here on the color management, and then also the look here, I set this to very high contrast to pop out the colors and make everything more contrasty and saturated. And then I also am using the cycles rendering engine because I am going for realism. So I am now in the shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mode, and then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'll select the object, and I can click on new, and I can just call this scratched metal. And then I want to add this material to the other object, so what I can do is just click and drag on this material, and I can actually drop the material onto that other object as well. So you can see they both have the same material. And then I also am going to be using the node wrangler add-on in the tutorial to preview the different nodes, so if you don't have the node wrangler enabled, you can click on edit, and you can go to the preferences, and then here in the user preferences, if you go to add-ons, you can go to the search, and you can type in node wrangler, and just enable the node wrangler add-on, so it's built into Blender, and I'll show you how to use the add-on in the video. So let's close the user preferences. So I'm going to start by making the textures for the scratches. So to do this, I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's drop the Voronoi up here, and then with the Voronoi texture selected, I'm going to press control T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And then also to use the node wrangler, let's control shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview the Voronoi texture on the object. Now I want to use the object coordinates, because the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the object more evenly. So let's put the object into the vector. So now let's change the Voronoi settings. So right here on the F1, I'm going to change this to distance to edge, and you can see it's going to give us these little lines here, and that is going to be the scratches. And then I want to turn the scale up to like a 50, so you can see more of it. And then I'll also turn the detail to like the max of 15, so you can see if I zoom in there, there's going to be much more small scratches. And then this roughness here, I'll turn to like a .75, and I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now this Voronoi texture is really hard to see, it's really dark, so let's go to the add menu, and we're going to search for a color ramp, and we'll put the color ramp after the Voronoi. So we can now use these two tabs here on the color ramp, and we can make it more contrasty. So I'm going to drag this white tab way over, and so you can see if there is more white on the color ramp, it's going to be lighter. So now you can actually see those cracks better. So now what I want to do is keep my nodes nicely organized, so I'm going to click and drag to box select both of these nodes, and I'm going to join them together into a frame by pressing control J. So this is just a nice way to organize the nodes. And then if I select the frame and press F2 to add a label, I'm going to call this mapping. Alright so we now have this Voronoi and this color ramp, but I want to add another Voronoi and another color ramp to make some more scratches, and then we're going to mix both of the scratch textures together. So with these two nodes selected, I'm going to press control shift D. So control shift D will duplicate the nodes, but it's going to keep the wires plugged up. And then let me control shift and select this color ramp here to preview it. So let's change some of this Voronoi texture settings. So for this one, I'm going to turn the scale to like 114, so that they are much smaller, but then all the other settings I will leave how they are. So if I control shift and select both of these, you can see that now we have two different amounts of scratches, some bigger ones and some smaller ones. So I now want to mix the bigger ones and the smaller ones together. So to do that, I'll go to the add menu, and we're going to search for the mix color node, because the mix color can mix two different colors together. So we're going to take this top one and we're going to put that into color A, and then this bottom one, that is going to go into color B. And then I can control shift and select this mix to preview it. So what I want to do is just add the dark values, because if I preview this texture here, you can see that the black values are darker, and so that's where the cracks are. So I just want to add the dark values. So let's control shift and select this mix again. So on the mix type here, I can change this to darken. And then if I turn the factor one, it's just going to add the dark values. So now you can see we have the bigger and smaller cracks mixed together. So let's box select all of these nodes, and we'll join them together into a frame by pressing control J, and I can select the frame and add a label by pressing F2, and I can call these scratches. Now I don't want these scratches to be all over the place. I just want them to be in some patchy areas here and there. So we're going to create another texture and use that texture as a mask to just make the cracks in some spots. So to do that, I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. We're going to stick the noise texture here. So just drag it like somewhere in here into the frame, and I can pull it up here. So now I also want to use the object coordinates. So let's take the mapping vector, and I can put that into the vector of the noise texture. And let's just control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Now on the settings here, I want to turn the scale up to like a 35, and let's also turn the detail up to the max of 15 so it is very detailed. And the roughness here, I'll turn this up to like a 0.73. Now I want to make this more contrasty because it's pretty gray right now. So I can select one of the color ramps, and I can press shift D to duplicate it, and I can drop it here next to the noise texture, so after the noise. And then if I change these values, so drag the white and black tabs, that'll change the contrast. So I'm going to drag the black tab to about here and the white tab to about there. So now we have a really good mask for just where the cracks are going to be or where the scratches are going to be. So I want to now mix them together. So I'll just select this mix color node, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here. And let's just drag it up here above this one. So because this color ramp is a mask telling where it's going to be, let's put the color into the factor. And then I can control shift and select the darken. So now I can take this darken here, and this is going to be the combined scratches, and we're going to put that into color A. So then we can control shift and select the darken. So then here on the darker result, I'm going to change this to the lighten. And why I'm using the lighten is because if I control shift and select the top color ramp, it's the dark parts are where those scratches are going to be, but then the white parts aren't going to have any scratches. So let's control shift and select the lighten. And then on this color here, color B, I just need to make this fully white. So now if I zoom out here, you can see there are a lot of scratches, but they're just in some spots here and there. But then I do want to make the entire thing a bit more contrasty. So I'm going to select one more of the color ramps, and I'll duplicate it with shift D. And let's just drop it here. And we can use this color ramp to make it more contrasty. So I'm going to drag the black tab over here, and then the white tab, I'll drag to kind of about here, so it's even more contrasty. All right, let's box select these nodes and just bring them out of the way. So that is going to be it for the scratches. Now as well as creating the scratches, I also just want to create a base texture. So to do that, we'll go to the add menu, and we're just going to search for a noise texture. We'll just add some overall noise to the metal. Let's drop the noise texture down here. And I want to use the same mapping because I want to use the object coordinates. So we'll take the mapping vector, put that into the vector, and I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Let's change some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to like a 15, and then I'll also turn the detail to 15. So now it is more detailed. However, I want to have there be some roughness, but I want to add a little bit of variation just to make it more interesting so that some parts have more roughness and other parts have less roughness. So I'm going to be adding another noise texture, and that noise texture is going to go into the roughness. So I'll select the noise texture, I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and let's drop it here. And then again, we want to use the vector. So we'll plug the vector into the vector here, the noise texture. So it's using the object coordinates. And I can control shift and select this noise texture to preview it. So for this one, I'm actually going to leave all the settings how they are, but I do want to make them more contrasty by adding a color ramp. So I'll go to the add menu, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. So let's drop the color ramp here after the noise texture. And then this color ramp can go into the roughness value of this noise texture. And then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So now if I drag the black and white values, that is going to control the roughness. So let me just zoom in here. If I make it more black, there isn't going to be quite as much roughness, because black is going to equal zero. However, if I drag the white tab over instead, white is equal to one. So if I drag the white tab over more and more, there's going to be much more roughness. So I'm going to drag the white tab to about here, and then also the black tab, I'll drag it to about there. Now, I want everything to be a bit more rough. So I can click on this black tab, and I can actually make this a pretty light color. So I'm going to make it kind of like a light gray, something like that. So now if I zoom in here, you can see that part is like less rough, but then over here, there is more roughness. So now I want to make the entire thing a bit more contrasty. So I'll go to the add menu. And again, we're going to search for another color ramp. We can put the color up after this noise texture here. And then I can just kind of drag these values together a bit more to make them a bit more contrasty. So something like that is a bit better. So let's zoom out here, and I want to keep the nodes nicely organized. So we'll box select all these nodes here, and I'll join them together into a frame. And then I want to select the frame, and let's add a label. And I can just call this like base texture. All right, so we now have the scratches in the base texture. So I want to join both of them together, and then we'll add that to the base color. So to mix colors together, we can again go to the add menu here and search for a mix color. Let's drop this here. And then this base texture, we are going to first put that into the factor. And that'll determine what parts are going to be color A, and then what parts are going to be color B. So I'm going to use color A and color B to make the actual colors for the metal. So for color A, I'm just going to make this kind of like a gray color. So maybe something like that, maybe a little bit darker. And then color B, this is going to be a very dark gray. So something like that. And if you want to use the exact same colors that I'm using, then you can go to color A, you can go to the hex value, and you can punch in 737373. And then here on the bottom one, color B, the hex value will be 323232. All right, so that's going to be the main colors of the texture, but then I also want to mix in the cracks. So we'll take this mix node, we'll press shift D to duplicate it, drop it here, and we can take the result and we can put that into color B. Now color A, this is going to be the colors of the scratches. But if I control shift and select the mix, we need to put something into the factor to actually tell this mix color where the scratches are going to be. And it'll put color A where the scratches are. So that is where the scratches come in. So this color can go into the factor. And now color A, if I drag this up and down, change the color, that is actually going to be the color of the scratches. And if you want to use the same scratches color that I'm using, the hex value will be 595959. And that's here on color A. So we can box select these nodes, we can join them together into a frame, we can add a label, and we're going to call this like base color. So because this is the base color, we can take this mixed result here, and we can put that into the base color of the principled shader. And I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. You can see that material is starting to look cool. However, I want to make it look like metal. So we need to make it more shiny and give it metallic value. So we'll turn the metallic up to one, so it is looking more like metal. And then just for now, I can just turn the roughness down a bit. However, I do want the roughness to have a bit of variation so that some parts are more rough and other parts are less rough. So I can take this mixed result here, and we're going to put that into the roughness. Now I want to be able to control the roughness values better. So we can just change the colors by adding a color ramp. So we'll go to the add menu, we'll add a color ramp, just drop this here, and then we can change the colors. So let's click on the black tab. And if we make the black colors lighter, so if more of the color is light, it's going to be more rough. However, if it is more black, it's going to be more shiny. So here in this black color, let's just make this kind of like a darker gray. And then this one here, let's turn this down a bit so everything is a bit more shiny. So it's kind of like a light gray. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, then here on this first one, it'll be 93, 93, 93 on the hex value, and then this second one here, this one is going to be CB, CB, CB. So now this is really starting to look like a cool metal material. And then also later on in the tutorial when we create the custom node group, I want to be able to control the roughness values. So we can just add a node which will make the colors lighter or darker, and then that'll control the roughness. So if we go to the add menu, we can search for the hue saturation value, and let's stick it here after the color ramp. So the hue saturation value has this value, so we can change the value to make it more rough or more shiny. So let's box select these nodes, and I'll join them together into a frame, and I'll add a label, and we can just call this roughness. And then I also want to add some bump, because right now the material doesn't really have any surface bump, so let's add the bump. So the first thing that I want to add is just add some overall bump to the entire material. So let's go to the base color noise texture, and we can take the factor, and we can drag this all the way over here and stick it into the normal. Now there's some weird shading issues, and that is because we need to convert the black and white data from the noise texture into normal data that the shader can use. So I'll go to the add menu, we're going to search for a bump node, and we'll stick the bump node here in the wire, and then to actually convert it to normal data, we want the normal here to actually be going into the height value instead. So the noise texture needs to be going into the height value. And now you can see the metal looks super, super bumpy, but that is way too strong, and I want this material to be pretty shiny and smooth, so I'll turn the strength to just like a 0.05, so it is much more subtle. And then I do want to add one more layer of bump, and that is going to be the scratches. So here on the bump node, I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and let's drop it here after the first one, so the normal can go through the normal, and so we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So let's go up here to the scratches, and what we can do is just take this color ramp color here, and we can put this into the height value of the second bump. And so that is going to, again, convert it to bump data. So if I zoom in here, it's kind of hard to see the scratches. Let's just go here to kind of the reflections, and I want to make these a bit stronger so they're easier to see, so I'll turn the strength up to just like a 0.1, and I can definitely see those scratches better. If you want to make them more and more bumpy, you can turn the scratches up, so now it's like super scratchy, but I just want to make the scratches a bit subtle, but you can definitely see those scratches just kind of around the material. So let's box select these nodes and join them together into a frame, and I can add a label, and let's just call this bump. And that is it for the procedural scratched metal. So I'm now going to show you how to join this together into a custom node group so it's easier to control the values. So what you can do is click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output, and then to join it together into a node group, you can press Ctrl G. You can press the tab key to go in and out of the node group with the node group selected. So let's drag the group input over here, and I can just drag it out to make it bigger, and then I can give it a name, so I'm going to call this scratched metal. So then let's go back into the node group, and if you press the N key to open up the side panel, we have this interface here. If you go to this group tab, and I want to rename this. So instead of calling it BSDF, I'll just rename it to shader. So if I go outside of the node group, you can see that it's now called shader. So if we go back into the node group with the tab key, I can go here to the group input, and we can add values up to the group input, and then that way we'll be able to control those values outside of the node group. So the first value that I want to control is the overall scale of the material. So this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures. So this scale will control the size of the entire material. So let's put the scale into the group input, and then if I click on the scale here, you can see that it's three values, but I just want to make it one value. So let's click on the vector, and I can change it to float instead. That'll make it one value. And then here on the default value, we need to turn this back to one, and you can see the texture's still gone. That's because we need to go out of the node group, and we need to turn the scale to one. So now that'll change the overall size of the material. So let's go back into the node group. Now the other value that I want to control is the metallic. So let's drag the group input way over here, drag it over to the principal shader, and we can take the metallic and put that into the extra socket. So now it says metallic, so that way we can control the metallic values. And then I also want to be able to control the colors. So if I drag the group input back here, this first mix is going to have the colors of the metal. So let's put color A into the extra socket, and then color B into the extra socket. And then if I double click on these to rename them, I'm going to rename this one to metal color one, and then this one I'll rename to metal color two. Now as well as controlling the overall scale of the material, I also just want to be able to control the scratch's scale and the base texture's scale. So let's drag the group input back here. Let's actually drag it down a bit. So what I can do is add another mapping node after these ones, and after these ones, and then we can use the scale values of those mappings to control just those textures. So what I first need to do is hold down the shift key and right click and drag over both of these wires, and then let go. And that's going to add a reroute. So I'm rerouting both of these together, so I can now drag this here into the base texture, so they're both going through the reroute. And then I want to do the same thing up here. So I'm going to hold down the shift key, and I'm going to right click and drag over these wires and let go. So that's added these to a reroute. So now we just have two single wires. So I can now go to the add menu, and we're going to search for a mapping node, and we'll stick the mapping node here between these wires, and then I'll press shift to duplicate, and we can drop another mapping node in between these wires. So now this mapping is just controlling these textures, and this mapping is just controlling these textures. So we can now take this scale, and let's put that into the extra socket. And this one, I want to rename this to just noise scale. And then this one up here, this one is just controlling the scratches, so I'll put the scale into the extra socket. And this one, I can double click on this, and I can rename this to scratches scale. Now both of these are going to have three values. If I go outside of the node group, you can see they have three values, but I just want one value. So we're going to go back into the node group, and we'll click on the noise scale, and we can change the type to float instead. And then the default value, we can turn to one. And then we'll do the same thing on the scratches scale. So click on the scratches scale, and we can change the type to float, and then the default value, we can turn to one. And then we need to go outside of the node group, and we need to turn the noise scale to one, and the scratches scale back to one. So now you can actually see the texture. So let's go back into the node group. Now I also want to be able to control the scratches color. So if I drag the group input way up here, we have this color here on the second mix, and that is going to control the color of the scratches. So we'll put A into the extra socket. And then I can rename this to scratches color. And then I also want to be able to control the roughness of the material. So we have this hue saturation value here, which the value will control the roughness. So put the value into the extra socket here, and then I can double click on this and just rename it to roughness. And then finally, I want to be able to control the bump strengths. So this first bump strength here is changing the noise. So let's put the strength into that extra socket. I can double click on this and rename it to noise strength. Basically I'm going to call this noise bump strength. And then this bump here, this one is going to control the bump of those scratches. So put the strength into the extra socket here, and this one I can rename to scratches bump strength. So scratches bump strength. So let's just drag the group input way over here underneath the mapping, we'll hit the tab key to go out of the node group, and we'll hit the N key to close the side panel. And that is it for the finished material. So real quick, I'll just review the material. So we have the overall scale of the material, we also can control that metallic value. And then we also have the different colors for the metal. And then we also have the noise scale just to change the size of the noise. So I can make the noise like really small or really big. And then we also have the scratches scale. So I can make the scratches quite big or really small. And then we also have the scratches color. So I can make them kind of like a dark color, or maybe if I wanted to make them look kind of rusty or something, I can maybe turn that to like a slightly red color. Then we have the roughness of the material. And actually, if you make it really rough, that looks pretty cool. It's like it makes the metal look more worn and old. And then we have the noise bump strength. And then finally, the scratches bump strength. So that's going to be it for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed this and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlqlrHNRbGs,Procedural Stylized Glowing Rock Materials (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to develop three procedural stylized glowing rock materials using a single custom node group. By adjusting customizable values such as scale, distortion, detail, and color, users can create various rock appearances, including effects like emission for glowing elements. The tutorial walks through the step-by-step process of setting up the scene, adding the necessary textures and nodes, and configuring the materials to achieve the desired stylized effect. The video also includes information about purchasing the project files and additional material packs from the creator's Gumroad store and Patreon page.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create these three procedural stylized glowing rock materials. So these materials are actually all just one material, and we're going to be joining the material into this custom node group, and then you can control the customizable values to make many different variations of the rocks. And so you can see just by changing some of the values, I've created these three different procedural glowing rock materials. So the stylized glowing rock materials have many different customizable values. So you can change this scale value to change the size of the entire material. Then we also have this cool rocks distortion, so you can make it more distorted if you want to. And then we also have this rocks scale value, so you can make the rocks smaller if you want to. Then we have this really cool rocks variation, so you can see if I turn this up, you're going to be able to see more of the emission color, and the rocks are kind of going in there, so if you want to make like some lava and have some rocks popping out of the lava, you could do that. Or you can drag this up if you want to see more of the rocks. Then we also have the rocks detail, so you can make the rocks less detailed if you want to. And then we also have this cool rocks lacanarity value, so if you turn this up, all the rocks are going to be kind of cracked, and there's going to be many small rocks. You can just see by turning that up, the rocks are kind of chunky and kind of cracked. Then we also have the different rock colors, so we have rock color 1, and then we also have rock color 2. And then we also have the emission color, so you can make any color you want, like if you want to make it look like a lava rock, you could have like lava coming through the cracks and make it kind of an orangey-red. And then we also have the emission strength. Then we have the roughness of the material, and then we also have the bump strength, and then finally we have the displacement strength. And the displacements will only work in the Cycles rendering engine, so if you are creating this, make sure you're using Cycles render if you want to use the displacements. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase these materials, then you can get them on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description. And if you like using procedural materials in your artwork, then definitely check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which comes with all of my procedural materials, pre-set up for Blender's Asset Browser, with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups.

Alright, so real quick, I'll show you my scene setup if you want to set up the Blender file the same way that I have. So I'm going to press Shift-C to make sure the 3D cursor there is in the center, and I'll go to the Add menu, let's go to Mesh, and I'm going to add a Icosphere. And I want to add an Icosphere because I want a nice, round, detailed sphere, because we're going to be using the displacements. Now, right after you add the Icosphere, before you click away or move it around, you can click right here behind me to open up the Add Icosphere setting. So just open that up. And I'm going to turn these subdivisions up to 6. And then I can just close those Add Icosphere settings, and then I can use the Object Context menu to shade the object smooth. And then the default objects in Blender are quite large. Using the real-life modeling scale in Blender, this object is a bit larger than an average human. So I'm going to scale this object down, and I'll scale it down by 0.1, hit Enter, and then using Ctrl-A, we can apply the scale, so this is now the object's new default size. So now this is maybe the size of a large rock. And then with the Icosphere selected, you can duplicate it with Shift-D, and I'm going to make two more of them, so that we can have the three different variations. Then I also added a camera, and I pointed the camera at the objects. And with the camera selected, if you go over here to the Object Data Properties, I turned the Focal Length up to 80, just to kind of zoom the camera in a bit. And to change the size of the camera, if you click right here to go to the Output Properties, you can change the resolution here, if you want to make it a very long image so you can see all the rocks. Now for the lighting, I added these three Area Lights right here. So if you go to the Add menu, you can go to Light, and you can add an Area Light. And then if you select the Area Light, and go here to the Object Data Properties, I turned the power of this one up to 600, and I made it a very slight blue color. And then I turned the shape to Rectangle, and I changed the X Size to make it kind of long, and I pointed it down on the objects. And then these two other ones are a little bit less bright, they're only about 300 or 400, and then the color is a blue color. And I have these kind of back here, pointed on the sides of the spheres, to give kind of some rim lights. So I'll go up into the Rendered View just to see how that's looking. And then also to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections, if you go over here to the World Properties, I added in this Abandoned Workshop HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, link will be in the description if you'd like to download it. So I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version from Polyhaven. So once you download the HDRI, you can click here on the yellow dot next to Color, and you can choose Environment Texture, and then just open up the HDRI. And I turned the Strength down to 0.5, so it was just half as bright. Now, I want to do a few more things in the render. So if we go up here to the Render Properties, if you click here on the Film tab, you can choose the Transparent button, and that way the HDRI will still light the scene, but you just can't see it in the background, so it's not quite as distracting. And also here on the Render Engine, I am using Cycles because I'm going to be using the Displacements, and the Displacements don't work in Eevee. Now also, if you go down here to the Color Management, I'm going to be using the View Transformer Filmic and the Look to High Contrast, just to pop out the colors and make things more contrasty and saturated. Alright, so now let's go over here to the Shading Workspace. So in the Shading Workspace, because I have these three of them, I'm just going to have this one up here, and then I'll have the Shader Editor right here. I need to hit the Escape key to go back to the Shader Editor. So now if I select this object here, I can click on New to add a new material. And you can just rename the material to whatever you want. And then because I'm not working with these two objects right now, I'm going to select these objects and press the H key just to hide them, so I can just see this object. And I'll hold down the Z button and move my mouse up to go into the rendered view. And then I will also be using the NodeWrangler add-on in the tutorial to preview the different nodes, so if you don't have the NodeWrangler enabled, you can click on Edit, and you can go to the Preferences, and then if you go over to the Add-ons tab, here on the search, you can search for a node, and just enable the NodeWrangler add-on, so it's built in a blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, we are going to be adding a Voronoi texture to get the rocked, cracked texture. So I'll go to the Add menu, and we're just going to start to type in Voronoi. We'll just add the Voronoi texture, and then because we turned on the NodeWrangler, I can Control-Shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it. Now, also with the Voronoi texture selected, I will press Control-T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I'm going to plug the object into the vector, because the object coordinates is going to place the textures on the object more evenly. And then here on the F1, I instead want to change this to Distance to Edge, and this is going to give us the cool cracked texture. Now we do want to change some of the settings here. So I'm going to turn the Voronoi Scale to 14, and I'll turn the Detail to the max of 15 so it's very detailed, and then also the Roughness here, I'll turn this up a bit to a 0.65. So now you can see we have these cool little cracks, and then we have more detailed cracks in the bigger cracks. Now here on the edges of the cracks, they're kind of straight, and so I want to add a Noise Texture to distort the edges of those cracks to make it look a bit more natural. So I'll press Shift-A, we'll go here to the Search, let's add a Noise Texture, and if we put the Noise Texture between the mapping and the Voronoi, that is going to go through the vector. So if we put it right in here, the vector is telling the texture how it's going to be placed on the object. So because the Noise Texture is between the mapping and the vector of the Voronoi here, it is distorting the placement of the Voronoi texture. Now let's change some of the Noise Texture settings. So I'll turn the Scale up to 15, and the Detail I'll also turn up to 15, and then the Roughness I'll turn up a little bit to like a 0.55. Now that is distorting it way too much, and so I want the Noise Texture to have less of an effect over the Voronoi. So I'll go to the Add menu, and I'm going to search for the Mix Color node, and we'll put the Mix Color after the Noise Texture. Let me click on these nodes, just box select them and bring them over so I have a bit more space. Alright, so what I want to do is use this mix to mix the Noise Texture and the mapping, and then we can control how much we want to use of the noise and the mapping. So let's take the mapping vector, and we're going to put that into Color A, and then we're going to take the Noise Texture factor, and we're going to put that into Color B. So now if I drag this factor around, you can see if the factor is 0, it's only using the mapping, so it's not distorted at all. But then if I turn the factor up, it's going to distort it more and more. Now as I drag this around, you can see that the texture is moving around a lot, so to make that not happen, let's click on the Mix here, and we can change this to the Linear Light. So this way, now as I drag the factor, it is distorting it, but the texture isn't moving around so much. So now here on the factor, I want to make it a very small number, so I'll turn it to a 0.02. So now you can see the edges are just distorted a little bit. So now I can kind of reorganize these nodes, so I'll just box select these nodes and kind of move them in, kind of bring these over here so we have a bit more space, just to keep that nicely organized, maybe even bring that up there. So now let's create the base color. So what I first want to do is make it a bit lighter, so I'll go to the Add menu, and we're going to search for the Color Ramp, and we'll put the Color Ramp after the Voronoi. So to make it lighter, I can just click on the white tab and I can drag it over, and that'll make it much lighter. So I'll just turn it to about there, so you can see the texture a lot better. So now to make the custom colors, I'll go to the Add menu, and we're going to search for another Mix Color, and we'll put the Mix Color here after the Color Ramp. Now the Color Ramp color, we want that to be going into the factor, so the black and white values from this Color Ramp are going to determine what parts are going to be Color A and what parts are going to be Color B. So I'll Ctrl-Shift and select the Mix again, so now we can make the different custom colors for A and B. So for Color A, I'm going to make this fully black, because I do want it to be pretty dark. And then on Color B, I'm going to make this kind of like a mid-dark brown color, so something like that. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, if you click on this color and go to the hex value, you can punch in 6F5236. So that's the exact color that I'm going to be using. So let's now take the result, and I'm going to put that into the base color, and I can Ctrl-Shift and select the Principled Shader to preview it. So it doesn't really look like rock right now, and that's because it doesn't have any bump. So let's take this Voronoi Texture Distance value, and we're going to stick this into the Normal to give it some bump. But you can see there's some weird shading issues, and that is because we need to convert this black and white data into normal data that the shader can use. So I'll go to the Add menu, we're going to search for the Bump node, and we'll just stick this here between the Voronoi Distance and the Normal. And then to actually convert it to bump data, we want to take the Distance and we want to put that into the Height value. So now you can see it looks nice and bumpy. Now that is a bit too strong, so I'm going to turn the Strength down to like a 0.4, so it's not quite as strong. And later in the video we'll be adding the Displacement, but right now we're just adding that fake bump. So that does look a lot more like rock. However, it is very shiny, and so I want to make it more rough, because rock usually isn't shiny unless it's very wet. So here on the Roughness, I'm going to turn this to a 0.725. I think that is a pretty good value, so it is more rough. Now I also want to make the Emission Texture to make some of the rock glowing. So to do that, I'm going to click on this Distance, and I'm going to drag out here, and then I will let go. And this way we can add a node at the end of that value. So I'm going to search for a Color Ramp, and we'll do the Color Ramp Factor. So click here, and then just drop it there. And then I want to Ctrl-Shift and select the Color Ramp to preview it. And I'm going to drag it down a bit farther, and then I'm going to click here, and I'm going to drag it out so that it is bigger, so we have more control over it. So now I want to create a white value wherever I want the emission to be. So the first thing I'm going to do is switch these values. So I'll drag the white tab over here, and then the black tab over here. And by switching the values and dragging the black tab way over, it's very contrasty, so now you can see just those little cracks are going to have the emission color. Now I do also want to have a few other colors in the other parts of the rock, so I'm going to hold down the Ctrl key and click here to add another tab, and I'll just drag this one over so it is very close. Then I will hold down the Ctrl key and click again to add another one, and on this one I'll click here on the black color, and I'll make this fully white. So now you can see there is more white areas right there on the rock. And I'll drag this over so it's pretty contrasty, and I'm actually going to drag this one over so it's a little bit bigger, just like that. Then I'll hold down the Ctrl key and click here to add another one, and this last one here, I'm going to make this one back to fully black. So basically, we are making the little white part, and that is where the cracks are going to be, and then this second white one, that's going to be just a few other areas where there is some white spots. So you can drag this around and make it more contrasty by dragging them closer together, and so I'm just going to go with something like that. So wherever the white parts are, that is where it is going to be emitting light. So now I want to create the custom colors for the emission. So I'll go to the Add menu, and we're going to search again for the mix color, and we'll put the mix color after the color ramp. And just like we did before here with this color ramp, we want to take the color, and we're going to put that into the factor. So now the white and black values are going to tell it what parts are going to be color A and what parts are going to be color B. So for color A, I'm going to make this fully black, and then for color B, this is going to be that bright blue color. And the hex value that I'll be using, if you want to use the same color that I'm using, you can go to the hex, and you can punch in 44ADFF. So that's the exact color that I'll be using. So now we can take this mix result, and we can put it into the emission. So what we can do is click here to open up the emission, and then we want to take the result, and we want to put that into the color. Now any color which is fully black, that will not be emitting light. So just where it is brighter and just where the colors are, that's where it will be emitting light. So I'll now Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now here on the emission strength, you can turn this up to make it brighter, and I'm going to turn it up to 7 so that it is pretty bright. And there we go, we now have the cool glowing rock. Alright, so we can now add the displacement to make the rock look really cool. So for the displacement, I also want to add another color ramp to control the values. So here on the Voronoi, I'll click and drag, and drag over here and let go, and then I can search for another color ramp, so color ramp factor, and drop this here. And I'm actually going to add a reroute by holding down the Shift key and then right-clicking and dragging and dragging over that wire to add a reroute. And I can drag this over here just to keep my nodes nicely organized. You don't have to do that if you don't want to, but I just want to keep the node wires very organized. Alright, and I actually want to drag this one out a little bit as well so I can control it a little bit better. So I can Control-Shift and select this color ramp to preview it. So any values that are white, those values are going to be popping out of the mesh. So I can drag this over and we can make it more white, and so those values will pop out more. But to actually see that taking effect, let's unplug the color from the surface and we want to instead plug it up to the displacement. And then I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader. Now to actually make it pop out of the mesh, we need to again convert this to displacement data. So we're going to go to the Add menu and we're going to search for the displacement node, and we'll put this here after the color ramp. And then we actually want the color ramp color to be going into the height value. Now you can see it does look like it's adding some more bump, but it's not actually popping out. And so why this is happening is because we need to go over here to the material settings, and we need to go down here and open up the settings and then open up the surface. And right here on the displacement, you can see this is set to bump only, but we want to change this to displacement and bump, and that's telling the material that it can use the displacement. And also if the displacement is still not working, you need to make sure you're using the Cycles rendering engine. All right, so I'll close those settings and I'll just make this smaller so we have more space. Now you can see it's popping out way too much. It's like really big, and that is because of the scale here. So I found that a scale of 0.011 works pretty good. So now you can see that it's not popping out that much. But now I can drag this white tab over and you can see if the values are more white, it's going to be popping out more. So I'm going to drag this white tab way over here. Just drag it over there so it's popping out quite a bit. And there we go. So there's the finished procedural rock material. And you can see the rock is popping out, but then the glowing parts are kind of going back down in. So now we can join this together into a custom node group. So I'll click and drag the box, select all these nodes, and I'll press Ctrl-G to join it together into a node group. And if you press the Tab key, that'll go in and out of the node group. So we'll go out of the node group and we're going to drag this node group over here. And then we can add the same name. So I'll just call this like Rock 1 and let's drag this out. And then I can hit Tab to go back into the node group. Now if you press the N key to open up the side panel, we can click here on Group and you can see that there's the interface here so that we can control the custom values. So I want to click on the BSDF and I'm going to drag it up here and then let go to bring it up to the top. And then I also want to click on this and I want to rename it to Shader. So if I go outside of the node group, now you can see it's Shader and Displacement. So let's go back into the node group. So now we can go over here to this group input and we can plug values up to the group input and then that way we'll be able to control those values outside of the node group. So I first want to control the overall scale of the entire material. So this mapping is plugged up to all the textures. So we can take the scale and we can put that into the extra socket. And then if we click on the scale, you can see it is three values, but I just want to make it one value. So let's change the type to Float instead so it is one value. Now the texture is missing. That's because we need to turn the default value back to 1 And then we need to go outside of the node group and we need to turn the scale back to 1. So now that will control the overall scale of the material. So we'll go back into the node group. Now we also want to be able to control the rocks distortion. And so this value here, the linear light, that is going to add distortion. So we'll click and drag and drop the factor into the extra socket. And then I can rename this to Rocks Distortion. And then I want to control the rock scale. So this Voronoi texture here, we can drag that scale to change the size of those rocks. So let's put the scale into the extra socket there. And then if I double click on this, I'm going to rename it to Rocks Scale. Now I also want to control the rocks variation. And this roughness will do that really well. So let's take the roughness and we'll put that into the extra socket. And then I can rename this to Rocks Variation. And then I also want to be able to control the detail and the lacunarity. So let's put the detail into the extra socket and the lacunarity, put that into the extra socket. And then if I double click on these to rename them, I'll rename that to Rock Detail and Rock Lacunarity. Now I want to control all the colors. So I'll drag the group input right up here. And we have these two colors here for the rocks. So I'll put this into the extra socket and also B into the extra socket. And if I double click on this, I'm going to rename it to Rock Color 1. And then this one is going to be Rock Color 2. And then I also want to be able to control the emission. So this emission color here on this mix, Color B is going to control that. So we'll take B, we'll drag this up here and stick it into the extra socket. And then I can rename this to Emission Color. Then I want to control the emission strength. So if I drag this kind of over here, over to the principled shader, we have this strength value. So I can put that into the extra socket and that's already called Emission Strength. And then I want to control the roughness. So here's the roughness value, we'll just put that in there. And then I want to control the bump strength. So we have this bump here, here's the strength. So let's just put that into the extra socket. And right here, I can rename this to Bump Strength on that side panel. And then the last thing that I want to control is the displacement strength. So I'll drag this group input over here. Let's take this scale and I can put that into the extra socket. And then I can rename this to Displacement Strength. Alright, so I can drag the group input right back over here. Let's just drag it down here. And I'll hit Tab to go out of the node group. And I'll press N to close the side panel. So there is the finished rock material. So I'll now press Alt-H to unhide the other objects that we hid. And I'm going to click and drag and I'm going to drop this material on both of these objects. But then let's click on this one. And I'm going to click on this button here to duplicate it. So the material is different and I'll just call it Rock 2. And then I also want to click on this button here. It says 3, I'll click on that to duplicate it. So now it is a separate material. And I'll rename this to Rock 2. So we have Rock 1 and Rock 2. And then this one here, let's do the same thing. So we'll click on this little button here. That's the little file icon to duplicate it. We'll rename it to Rock 3. And then if we click here on this button with the number, that'll duplicate it and we'll rename it to Rock 3. So now they're all separate even though they look the same. So we can now just change the values. So I'm now going to be creating this green one over here. So for the scale, I want to change this to a 1.18. That will be pretty cool. And then for the rock's distortion, I'm going to turn it to 0. Because I don't want it to be distorted at all. Then for the rock's scale, I'm going to turn this to a 20.6 so that it is smaller. And then for the rock's variation, I want to turn this up. And I'm going to turn this up to a 0.722. So that is looking a lot different now. Then let's go down here to the rock's lacanarity and I'll turn this to a 2.8. And then for the emission color, I'm going to make this green. So let's make it a cool green color. And the exact color that I'll be using, if you go to the hex value, you can punch in 35C120. That's the exact color that I'll be using. And then the emission strength, let's just turn this up to like a 12. And then I think the displacement strength could be up a bit. It could be turned up a bit so that it's a bit more bumpy. So the displacement strength, let's turn that up to a 0.015 instead. So it's just a little bit more bumpy. Alright, and then let's do the other one. So I'll click here on the other one and we'll change these settings as well. So for this one, I'm also going to turn the scale to a 0.180. And then for the rock's distortion, I'll leave this at a 0.02. Then for the rock's scale, I'm going to turn this to a 15.7. And then for the rock's variation, I'll leave this how it is at 0.65. And then let's go down here and change the emission color. For this emission color, I'm going to make it a bright red color. So something like that. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, over here on the hex value, you can punch in FF4800. And then here on the emission strength, I do want to turn this up a bit. So I'm going to turn it up to a 9. And then I will just leave the other setting how they are. However, I do want to pop out the rock just a little bit. So here on the displacement strength, I will turn this to a 0.15 again. And then one thing I forgot, I forgot to change the rock lacanarity. So let's change the rock lacanarity to 4 instead. And now that's looking much more cool. You can see that rock lacanarity is kind of breaking up the rocks and making many little different chunks of rocks. Alright, so you can save this again with CTRL-S, just save the file. And then I will render this and then we'll do some compositing. Alright, so I rendered the image by clicking here on render and clicking on render image. And then after I rendered the image, I went over here to the compositing workspace and then I clicked on use nodes here to use the nodes. And also I turned on the backdrop. So now let's just do a little bit of compositing. So I first want to add a denoise. So I'll go here to the add menu and we're just going to add a denoise. Or if you've done the denoise in the render, then you won't really need to add this. But I like using the denoise node. And I'll change the accurate to fast. And then what I also want to do is add some glares. So I'll go to the add menu and we'll add a glare. We'll drop this here. And on the streaks, I'm going to change this to the fog glow instead. And then here on the quality, I will make this high quality. And then I want to have two of them. So I'll duplicate this with SHIFT-D and just drop that there. So there are two of them. And then at the very end, I just want to make the background black. So I'll go to the add menu and I'm going to search for the alpha over node. And we'll drop that after the glare. Now to make the background black, we're going to take the image from the glare and we're going to put that into the bottom one. And then this top image here, we'll make that fully black so the background is black. And then let's CTRL-SHIFT and select the alpha over node. And that will add the viewer node. And so now we'll just let it composite. And adding the glare is really going to add a cool effect. So you can see now there's a nice glare on the material. So then to save this image, you can select the viewer node. Press the N key to open the side panel. And you can click on save this image and save the final image to your computer. So that is it. And that is how you create these procedural, stylized, glowing rock materials. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5t7gzIfTt0,Introduction to Procedural Shader Nodes for Complete Beginners (Blender Tutorial),"This beginner tutorial on Blender focuses on teaching the basics of using Blender's procedural shader nodes. The tutorial is designed for those familiar with the basics of Blender and interested in learning how to create simple procedural materials using shader nodes. It covers navigating the shader editor, creating a shader setup with nodes, and manipulating textures and values to create a basic metal material. The video also promotes the creator's Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack and a tutorial playlist for more advanced procedural materials. Additionally, the tutorial explains the difference between procedural and image textures and demonstrates creating and adjusting a procedural metal material.","In this Blender beginner tutorial I will show you the basics of how to use Blender's procedural shader nodes. So this tutorial is geared for beginners, so I'm going to show you the very, very basics of procedural nodes in Blender, and we're going to be creating a very simple procedural material with Blender's shader nodes. So this video is great for beginners who know the very basics of Blender, like maybe you know a little bit of modeling and a few shortcut keys, but if you haven't ever used the shader node before and you want to get into the shader nodes and just kind of learn the basics and learn how to create your own basic procedural materials, then that's what this video is geared for. Now, speaking of procedural materials, I did want to let you know about my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack. So my Ultimate Material Pack comes with all of my procedural materials, and they're all pre-set up for Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. So if you're interested in purchasing the procedural material pack, I'll have the links in the description, and purchasing is a really great way to help support this channel. And you can also check out my procedural material packs if you'd like to just purchase packs of 10 materials. And you can also find all of my materials individually on my Government Store. And after this procedural nodes beginner tutorial, if you'd like to learn how to create more procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist, where I show you how to create all of my procedural materials. So to use Blender's shader nodes, we need to go to the shader editor. So there are these workspaces right up here, and if you click on the shading one, that will take you to Blender's shading workspace. And so your layout might look slightly different than mine, but you should have a 3D viewport somewhere on the screen, and then also a shader editor. Now another way to do this, if you're just back here on the layout, if you want to open the shader editor, is you can click here on the corner when the crosshair appears. You can click and hold down your mouse, and you can drag out. And this is going to split the window, so we now have two 3D viewports. Now to make this be the shader editor instead, you can click here to change the editor type, and then you can change it to the shader editor. I am, however, just going to click here to go to the shading workspace. And then what I'll do is hold down the Z button, and I'll move my mouse up and let go to go into the rendered view, just because I want to be able to see this in the rendered mode. And you can see I also set up some very basic lighting, so we have some nice lighting to preview the materials. So this object doesn't have any material right now, and so there's kind of a base material that is given to all objects, and it's just this white material. But it doesn't actually have a material, so we need to add one. So if you select the object, there's two ways to add a new material. You can click over here to the materials panel, and then you can click new here, or if you're in the shader editor, you can also click on new here to add a new material. Now you can see over here on the shader editor, this is kind of a simplified version of the procedural nodes, but we're not going to be using this, because we're instead going to use the shader editor. And this is much more advanced. You can only do so much with the side panel, and it's kind of hard to use. It's much easier just to use the procedural nodes. So I'm just going to make this smaller to kind of get this out of the way, so we have a bit more space. Now you can rename the material if you want to. So right here, I'm just going to call it metal, because later on in the video, we will be creating a very simple procedural metal material. So on default, when you add a new material, there are going to be these two different nodes. So each one of these boxes in the shader editor is called a node. Now if you click and drag, you can move the nodes around, and then also, of course, you can use your scroll wheel to scroll in and out, and you can click down with your scroll wheel or your middle mouse button, and you can move around the view. So you can see that there are these little dots here on this side of the node and this side of the node, and then there are these wires which are plugged up to the nodes. And the wires are how the nodes communicate. So this here is the principled shader, and this is the default shader in Blender. So this is added to a material on default. And so this is basically a base material, and so there's going to be many different values that you can change. So there is the base color. So if I click on this, I could, for instance, make it like a blue color, and you can see now the sphere is blue. There's also this metallic value. So right now the material is not metal, but if I wanted to make it metal, I could turn the metallic value up, so I can click and drag it up, and now you can see it looks like a shiny metal sphere. I'll just turn this down. Now there's also this roughness value, so the roughness is how shiny it is. So if you wanted to make it look like a very shiny reflective plastic, I could turn the roughness down, and you can see now it is very shiny, and it's reflecting the HDRI lighting that I've added into the scene. Or I can turn the roughness up, and now it's going to look kind of chalky, and there's not quite as many reflections. I will turn it back to the default, which is 0.5. So you can click and drag to move around the values, or you can click on it, and then you can type in any value. So I'll type in 0.5. Now there are many other values, the base color, metallic, and roughness, those are some common ones that you'll use. There are many other values here, so if you click on these arrows to open them up, there's many different values. I am not going to be going over all of these though, because I want to keep this tutorial very simple for beginners, so these things you can learn about them later, but we're not going to be going over them in this video. So that is the principal shader, it is the base material, and then this over here, this is the material output. So any nodes which you create, they need to eventually be plugged into the material output if you want to see the material on the object. If I click right here on the yellow dot and then drag out, you can see that I'm actually unplugging the wire. And then if I let go, you can see now our base principal shader is not plugged up to the material output. So you can see now our sphere is fully black, because it doesn't have any shader. However, if I click right here on this little green dot, I can pull out a wire, and then I can stick it up here to the surface. And the volume and the displacement, we're not really going to go over that in this video, because again, I want to keep this video very simple for beginners. So these are a little bit more complex materials, which you can watch tutorials on. And if you watch my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist, I do make materials which use the volume and the displacement. But for now, we're just going to use the surface. So this principled shader, we want it to be applied to the surface of the sphere. So we're going to stick it up to the surface. So now that the wire is connecting, this data is going into the material output. And so that now can show up on the object. So in the shader editor, you can add different nodes, and you can plug all of the nodes up together. And that's going to give it data to tell it what the material is going to look like. So for example, I have this base color here, and I can change the color. So I could make it a blue color or red color. Let's actually go with like a green color. However, I might want to plug a texture up instead. So instead of using a single color, maybe I want to have a texture over this sphere. So what you can do to add new nodes is you can click here on the add menu, and there's going to be many different nodes. The other way to do this is by pressing shift A. So shift A or the add menu. Let's press shift A. And then there are different categories for different nodes. So for instance, there are different color nodes, there are different texture nodes. And again, I don't want to overwhelm you with too much stuff because there's a lot of nodes, but a lot of these nodes you don't really need to know about when you're first learning procedural materials. So I'll press shift A, and I'm just going to add a very basic common texture. And it's going to be the procedural noise texture. So to get to it, you can go down here to texture, and then you can choose noise texture. Or when you press shift A, you can just immediately start to type. So you don't actually have to click on the search here. You can if you want to, but you can also press shift A, and then you can just start to type, and you can type in noise. Here's the noise texture. So let's click on it. And now you can see it's following our mouse, and let's drop it here. Now when you are plugging up shader nodes, the shader nodes read from left to right. So for example, we first have the noise texture, and we want to put the noise texture on to the shader, and then the shader actually interacts with like the lighting and the 3D scene. And then that shader goes into the material output, which then it can show up on the object. So again, you start from left and you go to right. So it's kind of like reading left to right. So we now have this noise texture, but you can't actually see the noise texture. What I'm going to do is drag the material output up here, and then we can actually just take this noise texture, and we can take the factor, which is just black and white data, and we can pull out a wire just like we did earlier, and we can actually stick it right here into the surface. So now you can see that it isn't interacting with any light. It isn't actually showing you any light in the scene, and that's because we aren't using our shader anymore. We are just using a pure texture. However, you can now see the actual texture. And if you're wondering what the color is, we can actually replace this. So if you click and drag out a color, you can stick it here into the surface and you can see it's pretty much the same thing. It is the same noise texture, but it has random colors instead. But for this example, I just want to use the black and white. So let's click here to pull out a wire and we can stick it into the surface that we can see it. All right, so back to the actual noise texture. So we now have the noise texture plugged into the surface so that we can see it. So now we can change different settings. So just like the principled shader here, it has different settings that you can change. There are different settings here which will change how the noise texture looks. So for example, there is this scale, so you can make it really big or really small. There's also this really cool detail level. So you can turn this all the way up, and if you push it all the way up, it'll stop at 15. And now if you zoom into the texture, you can actually see it has a bit more detail. Then there is this cool roughness value here, and this is pretty much going to add more detail. I don't really know why they call it roughness because it's kind of like a second layer of detail. You can see if I turn this way up, you can see there's much more detail there. Or I can turn this down and you can see the noise is going to look much more blobby. So I might turn the roughness up a little bit, maybe like a 0.7, so it has more detail. Then there is this lackinarity value, so I can turn this up. And if I turn this one up, you can see there's going to be these little clumps of dots. And then finally, there is this distortion here, and this is going to kind of distort it and it's just going to change the shape of it. You can see it looks all wobbly now. So the lackinarity, I will turn back to 2 because that is the default, and the distortion, I will turn that back to 0. So this isn't really a great material for realism because we don't actually have any shading data, so there's no lights or anything interacting with the object. So what we can do is we can take the factor and we can instead put it into the base color. So we'll put the factor and put it into the base color. And then we want the BSDF, which is the output here of the shader, and we can instead replace that so we'll stick it into the surface. So now you can see that the actual lighting data is interacting with the object, so it's kind of light over here, there's kind of a blue color over here, but you can see that it has now replaced that green color. So we are basically replacing the green color for that texture instead. Now you may also be wondering what the difference is between a regular texture and a procedural texture. So if you press Shift-A, you can go to the search and you can search for an image texture, and this is just an image texture node. And so then what you can do is you can click on Open, and you could add an external file into Blender. So for instance, if you have a JPEG file or a PNG file, and you wanted to add that image onto your shader, then you could do that by opening it up here and then just selecting the image. So this is not a procedural texture because this is where you would add an image texture into Blender. However, this here, this is a procedural texture. And so basically what procedural means is that it has been generated procedurally within Blender. So an image texture here is something that you would need to have on your computer. So maybe you've downloaded a wood texture from a texture website online, and so once you've downloaded that, you would open it up. And so that would be an external texture on your computer, which Blender is using. But the noise texture is procedural, and so it is being procedurally generated just within Blender. So you don't actually need a PNG or JPEG file, which looks like noise. It's just being procedurally generated within Blender. And so that is what a procedural material or a procedural texture is. And what's really cool about procedural textures is you can adjust them just like we've done before. So you can change the roughness and the detail and the scale, and you couldn't do that with a normal texture. Like let's just say you downloaded a JPEG file of like a wood texture, and then you opened it up. You couldn't really adjust any of the values because it is using actual pixels. It's a JPEG file or a PNG file, so you couldn't actually adjust the texture. However, with this noise texture, you have many different adjustable settings because it has been created procedurally within Blender. Now you can see just like the principled shader has different sockets here, which you can plug information up to it. The noise texture also has different sockets here, so you can plug information up to it. A really simple example to show you how to use this is let's say we want to change the scale and detail values at the same time. So before I do that, I should make these values the same. So I'm going to turn the scale to 15 and the detail to 15. So let's say when I change the scale, I also want the detail to get less. Well, to do that, I could press shift A and that'll bring up the add menu. And then I can start to type in value and we're going to add the value node. Let's drop it here. So this value node is very simple. It is literally just a value. So you can turn this value to whatever you want. And then if you plug it into different sockets, it is going to use that value. So let's take the value and we can plug it up to the scale. And then we can also take the value and we can also plug it up to the detail. So now again, this value here is going to override the scale. So if I unplug this, you can see now the scale is set to 15. But if I plug the value up to the socket here, it is going to override the scale and it will instead use this scale instead because we are giving it that data. So now I could drag this up and you can see as I turn it up, it is getting more detailed, but it's also getting smaller. And then as I drag this down, it is getting bigger and the detail is getting less. So that is pretty cool. So that's just a very simple way that you can plug data or information into another node. And then of course this noise data is going into the principled shader. Now let's say that you want to edit the colors or the contrast of the noise texture before it goes to the principled shader. Well in between the noise texture and the principled shader, we could add more nodes in here to actually edit what the noise texture looks like. So for example, I could press shift day, let's go here to the search and a very common node is the color ramp node. So you can search for color ramp. Let's click on the color ramp node and then to add it right in here, instead of like dropping it here and then like dragging the factor up to it and then plugging the color up to it. What you can do right after you add the color ramp is you can hover it over the wire and you can see the wire turns that light color and then you can let go. And that is going to automatically plug it into our node setup. So now because the color ramp is after the noise texture, it is going to affect the noise texture and then that will affect the base color. So the color ramp is a really cool node. It's one of my favorite nodes. You can see on default there is this little black tab and this little white tab. And what you can do is click on these tabs and you can drag them around. And if there is more black areas, you can see it's going to make the texture more black. Or if there is more of the white area, it's going to make the texture more white. And if you drag them closer and closer together, there's going to be lots more contrast. Now if you click on the tab, you can click down here on this little color value and it'll give you a color palette and you can just change it to whatever color you want. So you could make this like a blue color and this one here. You could maybe make this like a light blue, maybe even like a green. And so you can just change those colors. So now the noise texture has a different color and that is going into the base color. Alright, so hopefully this has given you a good understanding of the very basics of procedural shader nodes. But I remember when I was first learning Blender, I really enjoyed learning if I was actually creating something while I was learning. So we're now going to be creating a very basic metal material. So what I'm going to do is actually just start fresh. So I'll click on here to get rid of this material and then let's click on new to add a new material. So again, it's going to give us a principled shader and the material output. So to make the material look like metal, we have this cool metallic value. So I can drag the metallic value up and you can see now it looks a bit more like metal. And then for the base color here, metal usually is a little bit darker. So if I click on this color, I can maybe make it a little bit darker. So now it's kind of like a gray color. And then I do want to make this metal look a bit more shiny. So this roughness here, we can drag it down and you can see now it is more reflective. So it's reflecting the light and other objects which are in the scene. So already we have a pretty basic metal material, but I want to make it look a bit more interesting by adding some more textures up to it. So we're going to be adding that noise texture that I showed you earlier in the video. So if I press shift A for the add menu, I can start to search for noise and let's add the noise texture. And then we can take this factor and we can put that here into the base color. And now the noise texture is controlling the actual colors of the shader. Now I might want to control this better because maybe I want some parts to be darker. So let's add that color ramp to adjust the colors. So if I press shift A, let's go to the search here and I can search for the color ramp node. It's one of my favorite nodes. Let's add the color ramp. And we want to put the color ramp in between the noise and the principled. And why we're doing that is because first we need the noise texture data. Then we're going to edit the noise texture data with the color ramp. And finally, that will go into the principled shader. So now what I can do is change these colors. So let's say maybe I want to make the metal darker. I can click here on this white color right here and I can click on this color and I can make it a little bit darker. So now it is more of a gray color. So now that looks kind of cool. And if I want to make it more contrasty, I could also drag these tabs together. And so if I drag them together, you'll be able to see more contrast. And then another cool thing you can do to make it look more interesting is to change some of the noise texture settings. So let's make it really detailed. So I'll turn the detail all the way to the max of 15. And now that definitely looks more interesting. And also this roughness here, we could maybe turn it up to like a 0.6 and that looks even cooler. So that is a really cool metal. Now it kind of looks like a dirty metal. And also if you want to make it look a little bit more dirty, maybe add some dirt. You could just click here on this black color and you could click on this color and maybe you could make it a little bit brighter and then you can make it kind of an orangey color. And if you make it orange and then make it darker, that is going to make it brown. So basically to make brown, you make orange and then you just make it really dark. So now it kind of looks like a dirty worn metal. Now another really cool thing we could do is we could plug data into the roughness. And if we plug some information up to the roughness value, then that's going to tell the material what parts are going to be really shiny and what parts are going to be really rough. So right now we just have a single roughness value. So the metal has the same amount of roughness all over the material. However, in the real world, there is slight variation. So some little parts of the metal might be a little bit more scratched or a little bit more rough and other parts might be a little bit more smooth and a little bit more shiny. So what we can do is we can actually just take this factor value and we can plug it into the roughness. So now what you can see is happening is some parts like right over here, that looks a bit more shiny, but then other parts like right over here, that looks really rough. So it almost looks like right here, it's kind of been rubbed with some sandpaper. So it's really rough. But then right over here, this has been nice and smooth. So that gives the metal more variation. So it looks more realistic. Now I do want to make all of the metal look a bit darker. So an easy way to do this is to just add some data in between the noise and the principled and we can make it a bit more shiny. So what I'm going to do to change the colors is I will press shift day and let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the hue saturation value node. So let's click on the hue saturation value and I'm going to put it in between the noise and the roughness because I need the noise data and then I'm going to make it darker and then it will go into the shader. So let's drop the hue saturation value right here. Now to see what it is doing, let's take the color here and I can stick it up to the roughness. So here is the noise texture and it doesn't really look any different, but we now have the hue and the saturation and the value. Now the hue and the saturation we're not going to use because those are just controlling colors but we are going to use the value. So the value is going to make it lighter or darker. So if the value is really high it's super bright or if the value is really far down it is dark. Now if I plug the principled shader back up to the surface you can see that by changing the value that is going to make the material more light or more dark. Now you might be wondering how colors can affect numbers because if I unplug this wire right here you can see that originally this roughness has a number. So if the roughness is turned to zero it is going to be super shiny and it looks like a mirror but if the roughness is turned to one it is going to be super rough. Now how the color can affect the number is if the color is fully black that is equal to zero and if the color is fully white that is equal to one. So let's take the color again and we can put that into the roughness. So if I turn this value way up that is going to make it lighter and so again if it's fully white that's going to equal one. But then if the value is turned all the way down to zero it is now fully black and so fully black is going to equal zero. So that is how you can use the colors to actually affect the numbers which will control the roughness. So maybe this value here I'll just turn it down a little bit to make it look a bit more shiny. And then one more thing that I might want to do is go over here to the noise texture and maybe turn the scale up to like a ten so you can see it better. And now you can see that we've created this really cool metal material. And so I'm going to end the tutorial here. So if this is the first time you've used Blender's shader nodes then congratulations you've created your first procedural material. Now this is just a very simple material and there's so many more things you can do with Blender's procedural shader nodes. So if you'd like to learn more then I highly recommend checking out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist. And so in that playlist I have literally over 100 procedural material tutorials and I'm always creating more and adding more to the playlist. And so in the playlist I have tons of different procedural material tutorials like food tutorials. So I have like a procedural cheese material, I have a procedural banana material, a procedural apple material, I also have some different procedural candy materials, I also have some rock materials, some dirt materials, some sand materials, I have some like other metal materials and some sci-fi materials, I also have some planet surface materials like an Earth material and a Mars material and some other alien planets, and so many more procedural materials. And so I highly recommend checking out that tutorial playlist if you'd like to learn more about procedural materials.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQyFI4bOFBU,Procedural Battered Metal Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video is a Blender tutorial on creating a procedural battered metal material. The instructor demonstrates how to create the material, adjust various attributes like metal colors, noise, and rust properties, and then combine everything into a custom node group for easy manipulation. The tutorial also includes details on setting up a Blender scene for rendering, using lighting, and camera settings. Additionally, the video promotes the instructor's Gumroad store and Patreon for purchasing procedural materials and provides links to resources and further tutorials.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural battered metal material. And then after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group. So I'll just review the material. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the material. And then we also have two different metal colors. So we have metal color one and two. So you could make it kind of like a lighter gray if you want to. Then we also have this noise scale. So you can just change the size of the noise on the surface of the metal. And then we also have the noise detail. So I could turn that down if I want to be a bit more bumpy. Then I also have the noise roughness. So if I turn that roughness up, it'll be much more detailed. Then we also have the rust color. So right now it is kind of like a dark red color, but you could of course change that color if you want to. And then we also have this rust amount value. So you could add much more rust if you want to, or just little bits of rust. Then we have the rust brightness, you can make the rust much more visible, or you can make it very subtle. And then we have the rust scale. So that'll just change the size of the noise texture, which is controlling that rust. And then we also have the rust detail. And then we also have the rust roughness. So you can see if I turn the roughness down, it looks like there's some big chunks which have been taken out of the metal. Or if I turn it up, it's going to be a bit more subtle. And then we also have the rust distortion. Then we have the roughness of the material. So if you want to make a more shiny metal, you could turn that down, or you can turn the roughness up. And then we have the metal bump strength. So that'll just change the bump surface strength. And then we also have the rust bump strength. So you can make the rust more bumpy or less bumpy.

Alright, so I'll now show you my scene setup if you want to set up the Blender file the same way that I have. So I press Shift-A, and I went here to Mesh, and I just added an icosphere because I want a nice, round, smooth sphere to preview the material on. And then right behind me, if you click on the little Add Icosphere Settings, just click on that and open it up, you can turn up the subdivisions. And I'm just going to turn it up to 6, and then I can close those settings. So we now have a nice, smooth icosphere. And then I'm going to use the Object Context menu, and I'll shade the object smooth. So I'll now hit S to scale, and I'm going to scale it down by 0.2, and then hit Enter. And then I can press Ctrl-A, and just apply the scale. Because the default objects in Blender are quite large, so I'm just scaling this down to a better size. And then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the sphere. And also, if you select the camera, and then go over here to the object data properties of the camera, I turned the focal length up to 80, just to zoom the camera in a bit. And then also, if you want to make the camera be a square image, then if you go up here to the output properties, you can change the resolution to the same numbers. So I'm just using 1920 by 1920, and then I bumped up the resolution to 200, so it's a nice, large image. Now for the lighting, I added these three different area lights right here. So I pressed Shift-A, and I went down here to Light, and I added an area light. And then once you add the area light, you can click here to go to the object data properties to change the light settings. And I changed the shape to disc, and then I also turned the power up to 200, and I turned the color here to a very slight yellow color. And I pointed it at the sphere. And then these two other lights here, the shape is also set to disc on these ones as well. And I turned the power to 10, and I just left them at a white color. But then I pointed them at the back of the sphere, and that way it'll give a nice rim light on the back of the sphere. And then also, to get some nice, realistic lighting, I went over here to the world properties, and I added in this studio country hall. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, so I'll have a link in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. And on polyhaven.com, I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. So once you download the HDRI, you can go here to the world properties, you can click on the yellow dot next to color, and you can choose environment texture, and then just click on the open button and open up the HDRI. So I'm now going to hold down the Z button, and I'm going to move my mouse up into the rendered view so I can see this in the rendered mode. And if you want to make the background transparent, so you can't see the HDRI in the background, you can go here to the render properties, you can open up the film tab right here, and then you can check mark the transparent button. And that way you can't see it in the background. And then also, if you go down here to the color management, I'm going to use the view transform of filmic, and I'm going to change the look to very high contrast. And this will pop out the colors and make everything more saturated. So I can now click over here on the shading workspace. So on the shading workspace, I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mode. And then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'm just going to click on new to add a new material, and I can just rename this material to battered metal. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on edit, and you can go to the preferences, and then just go over there to the add-ons tab and search for Node Wrangler, and you can check mark the Node Wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So I'll press shift A, and I'm going to go to the search, and I'll search for a noise texture. Let's put the noise texture here. And then to use the feature of the Node Wrangler, you can hold down the control and shift key and select different nodes, and that is going to preview the node on the object. And also select the noise texture, and you can press control T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I want to use the object coordinates, so let's take the object and put that into the vector. And the object coordinates is going to place the noise texture on the object more evenly. So now we can change some of the noise texture settings. So I'll turn the scale to a 10.5, and then I also want to make it very detailed, so I'll turn the detail to the max of 15. And then the roughness here, I will turn this to a 0.55, so there's just a little bit more roughness. Let's drag these nodes out of the way, and I now want to make this more contrasty, so I'll press shift A, and I'll go to the search, and I'll search for a color ramp, and we'll put the color ramp after the noise texture. So now I can drag these two values together, and you can see if they are closer together, it's going to be much more contrasty. So I'm actually going to flip these two values, and I'm going to put the black tab to about here, and then I'll put the white tab over to about there, something like that. And so now it just has a bit more contrast, so there will be different colors on the metal. So I now want to make the colors for the metal, so to do that, I will press shift A, and I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for a mix color, and let's put that after the color ramp. Now this color up here, I want that to be going into the factor, and the factor is determining what parts are going to be color A, and what parts are going to be color B. So we can now make the different colors. So here on color B, I'm going to make this one fully black, and then here on color A, I'm going to make this a very, very dark gray. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using for color A, then you can click on the color and go to the hex, and you can punch in 191919. Alright, so that is the color that I'm using, and we'll be able to control these colors later in the custom node group. So let's take the result, and I can put that into the base color, and I can control shift and select the principal shader to preview it. And then if you want to change how contrasty the color ramp is, you can. So you can kind of drag this out, or drag this out, and you can see there's more of the lighter color or the darker color. So I'm just going to leave it to about here. Now because this is metal, I want to take the metallic and turn it all the way up to one, so it is a metallic material. Now because this is a super worn old metal, I want to have some variation of where it's metallic and where it's less metallic, because some parts might have some dirt or some rust on them, so I don't want the entire thing to be metallic. So I'm going to take the noise texture factor, and I'm going to plug that into the metallic. And then to be able to control this, I will select this color ramp, I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and I'll drop it here on the wire, so in between the noise texture factor and the metallic. And then with the color ramp selected, you can hit the backspace, and that is going to reset it. So I'm going to take this black color here, and I'm going to make it fully white. And then this white tab here, I'm going to click on this color, and I'm just going to make it a little bit darker. So by making all the values white, it is fully metallic, but then if I click on this white color and make it darker, less and less of it is going to be metallic. So I'm just going to make this a very light gray, and the hex color for this lighter gray is going to be D9, D9. And then I also want to make this metal a bit more rough, so let's go to the roughness here, and I'll turn the roughness up to 8.6, so it is a bit more rough. And then I want to add a bit of surface bump, so we can take the noise texture factor, and we can put that into the normal. And then you can see there's some weird shading issues, and that's because we need to convert the black and white data into normal data that the shader can use. So I'll press shift A, and I'll go to the search, and I'll search for the bump node, and we'll put the bump node between the noise and the normal. So just stick it there, and I can drag it down. And then we actually want the factor to be going into the height value of the bump, and that'll convert it to bump data. So now you can see it looks very bumpy. Now I do want to invert this, so I'm just going to invert that there by checking on that. And then this strength here, I'm going to turn this down to like a 0.3, because it's a bit too strong, so I'll just turn it down to a 0.3, so it is less strong. Now I do want to be able to control this a little bit better, because I want some parts to be more bumpy and other parts to be less bumpy. So I'll press shift A, and I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for the RGB curves, and we're going to put the RGB curves in between the noise and the bump. So now I can adjust the curves here, and that is going to control how bumpy it is. So I'm first going to click here in the center to add a dot, and I'm going to drag this down here, and then I can click on this dot here, and I'm going to drag this way down. So now you can see that some parts look really smooth, but then other parts are more bumpy. So I'm going to drag this dot kind of down here to the middle of this grid, and then I can click here to add another dot, and I'm going to drag this one up a bit so it's a bit bumpy, and then click here to add another dot, and I can drag this up so it's a bit bumpy. So we're kind of making this wavy effect. So now that we've done that, you can see there are a few parts here which are a bit more smooth, but then parts over here are a bit more rough. So it just gives the material a little bit more variation. Alright, so I now want to create the rust. So I'm going to click on this noise texture here, and I'm going to press ctrl shift D. So ctrl shift D will duplicate the node, but it's going to keep these wires plugged up to it. And then I can ctrl shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So let's change some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 24.5. Let's also leave the detail to the max of 15, and also the roughness here, I'm going to turn this to a 0.85, so it has more roughness. So I now want to make it more contrasty, because I only want some rust here and there. So I'll click on the color ramp, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and I can drop it here after the noise texture. And then I can just adjust these values here. So I'm going to drag the black tab over and drag the white tab over, and make it pretty contrasty. So just something like that is pretty good. So there's just a few white parts here and there, but it's mostly black. So I'm now going to be adding in the rust color. So I'll click on the mix node here, I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and I'm going to drop it here after this first mix. And then I want to take this color ramp here, and this is the color ramp for the rust, and I'm going to put that into the factor. So the factor is determining where it's going to be color A and where it's going to be color B. So then this mix here, I can put that into color A. So then color B, if I control shift and select the mix to preview it, color B is going to be the rust color. So if I turn this up, you can see now it's white. So I'm just going to make it like a red color, and I'm going to make it very dark. And the hex color that I'll be using for the rust is going to be a hex value of 3C0F00. So it's very dark, but you will be able to see it in the final material. So now what I can do is make sure that this mix here is going into the base color, and I can control shift and select the principle shader to preview it. And now you can see that rust there on the material. Now I also want to make the rust more bumpy. So what I want to do is click on this bump node here, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and I'm going to drop it here after the first one. And then what I can do is take this color up here. This color ramp is basically the mask for where the rust is. So I'm going to put the color into the height value, and then just control shift and select the principle shader. And I do want it to be a bit stronger. So I'm going to turn this bump strength to a 0.4. So now if I zoom in there, you can see that it's a little bit more bumpy there. Now later on in the custom node group, I want to be able to control the amount of rust. So what I'm going to do is hold down the shift key, and I'm going to right click and drag over these two wires here, and then let go. And that is going to add a reroute here. So it is making one wire, and then it is splitting off to the bump and the color. So then right in here, I can press shift A, I can go to the search, and I can search for the hue saturation value. And we're going to drop that after the color ramp. So if we take this value, and if we turn it up and down, you can see it's going to add lighter values or make it darker. And so because that is going to the factor, that is going to control how much rust there is, or it's going to control the brightness of the rust. And then to make there be more rust all around the material, I can do the same thing over here. So I can click on the hue saturation value, I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here after the noise texture. So now that this hue saturation value is after this noise, the value is going to make the color and texture lighter or darker. And so that's going to control how much rust there is. So we'll use those values later in the custom node group. And then there is one more thing that I want to do, I want to go to this color ramp here, which is after this noise texture. And this is controlling the color one and color two. And I think that it's a bit too contrasty right now, because you can see that middle is really dark, but then this middle is light. So I can kind of drag these values back. And if I drag them back and farther away, it's going to be a bit less contrasty. So let's drag that to about there. So now it's a little bit more of an even gray color. And that is it for the procedural material. So I'm now going to show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So I'm going to click and drag the box, select all the nodes except the material output. And I'll press Ctrl G to join it together into a node group. And if you press the Tab key, that is going to go in and out of the node group. So I'm going to drag the node group over here, and let's make it bigger. And then I can take the battered metal name, I'll copy that name and paste it here. So it is now called battered metal, and then select the node group and you can hit the Tab key to go into the node group. And if you press the N key to open the side panel, you can see there is the custom values. And I want to double click on this to rename it. And I'm going to rename it to shader because I like that a bit better. So let's now take this group input, I can drag it down here, we can plug up any values up to the group input. And then that way, we'll be able to control those values outside of the node group. So let's go into the node group. And I first want to control the overall scale the material. So this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures. So this is going to change the entire size of the material. So let's put the scale into the extra socket. And if you click here on scale, you can see that it is three values, but I instead want it to just be one value to control the scale. So I'll click on the vector here, and I'm going to change it to float instead. Now you can see the texture is disappeared. That is because when you turn the default value back to one, and then if we go outside of the node group, we need to turn the scale back to one. So now that'll control the overall scale the material. So let's go back into the node group. So I now want to control the metal colors. So I'll drag the group input over here. And I can take color B, put that into the extra socket, color a put that into the extra socket. And then I can rename these here. So I'm gonna rename this to a metal color one. And then also right here, I'm going to rename this one to metal color two. And then I want to be able to control some of the noise settings. So let's drag the group input down here. And we can put the scale into the extra socket, and also the detail and also the roughness. And then here, if you double click on these to rename them, I'm going to add noise at the beginning. So noise scale, and noise detail, and also noise roughness. And then I also want to be able to control the color of the rust. So I'll drag the group input over here. And let's take the rust color here, which is color B on this mix, I can put that into the extra socket. And then if I click on this to rename it, I'm going to rename it to rust color. Now I want to be able to control the rust amount. So if I drag the group input back here, we have this value here to control how much rust there is. So let's put the value into the extra socket. And I can rename this to rust amount. And then to control the rust brightness, we have this one here. So the second hue saturation value. So let's take this value, we can put that into the extra socket. And then I can rename this to rust brightness. And then I want to be able to control some of the rust settings. So let's drag the group input down here. So this top noise texture is controlling the rust. So let's put the scale into the extra socket, also the detail and the roughness and the distortion. And so now we can click here on these values. And I'm going to add rust to the starting so rust scale, and rust detail, and then also rust distortion, or rust roughness, and also rust distortion. And then I want to be able to control the roughness of the material. So let's go over here to the principal shader here, we can take the roughness, we can drag out a wire, we can stick this into the extra socket. So now we can control the roughness. And then I want to be able to control the bump strength. So let's drag the group input down here. And I want to take this first bump strength, and let's put that into the extra socket. And then the second bump strength, we will put that into the extra socket. So the first bump strength is just controlling the metal. So I'm just going to call this metal bump strength. So metal bump strength. And then the second one here, this is controlling the rust. So I'm gonna rename this one to rust bump strength. Alright, so I'll drag the group input back here, I'll press the N key to close the side panel, and I'll hit tab to go out of the node group. So we have the overall scale of the material. And then we also have the different metal colors. So metal colors one and two, then we have the noise scale. And then we also have the noise detail and the noise roughness. Then we also have this rust color here. So you can change the color of the rust. We also have the amount of rust, you can have there be lots of rust or very little rust, and the rust brightness if you want to see it better. And then we have the rust scale. Also, we have the rust detail. So you can have big chunks of rust if you want to. And also the rust roughness. So this is pretty cool. If you turn this down, it looks like there's big chunks of rust. And then the rust distortion. And then finally, we have the roughness of the material so you can make it more shiny if you want to. And then we have the metal bump strength and the rust bump strength. So that is going to be it for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed this and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iurHVVGGnU,Procedural Christmas Candy Material 🍬 (Blender Tutorial),"The video is a Blender tutorial demonstrating how to create a procedural Christmas candy material. The tutorial covers setting up a customizable node group in Blender that allows users to adjust various parameters such as the scale, colors, amount of swirls, candy variation, roughness, and bump details of the material. The instructor also explains how to set up a scene in Blender with lighting and camera adjustments to render the candy material. Additionally, the video promotes the instructor's other Christmas-themed tutorials and offers the material for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural Christmas candy material. So as I record this, Christmas of 2023 is almost here, and so every year before Christmas, I love making Christmas themed tutorials. And if you have any Christmas themed tutorial requests, then definitely let me know in the comments. And you can also check out my Christmas tutorial playlist if you'd like to watch more of my Christmas themed tutorials. So in this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural Christmas candy material. And after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this customizable node group. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the entire material, so you can have lots of lines or very little lines. And then we also have the different colors, so colors one, two, and three. Then we have the amount of swirls, so you can make very few swirls or lots of swirls. And then my favorite value here, the candy variation. So you can use this candy variation to make it look very different. So there's a really cool one that's 0.38. Or you could also do like this one here, that's a 0.59. Or you could turn it up to a 1.35. So that one's pretty cool. There's just so many different variations you can get by changing the candy variation. Then there is the roughness of the material, and also the bump scale, and then also the bump strength for the surface of the candy. And if you'd like to help support me and this channel and purchase the material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description. And to purchase all of my materials, you can check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which has all of my procedural materials pre-set up for Blender's Asset Browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. And you can also check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist to learn how to create all of my procedural materials. Alright, so real quick, I'll show you my scene setup if you want to set up the Blender file the same way that I have. And I do apologize that my Screencast Keys isn't working. The Screencast Keys add-on which I use isn't working in Blender version 4.0, so I'll have to figure that out and find an add-on that works to show my Screencast Keys. So in a new scene in Blender, you can press Shift-A, and I'm going to go here to Mesh, and I'm going to add a Cylinder. And then I want to scale this down so it is closer to the real-life size in Blender, because these objects on default are quite large. So I'm going to scale this object down by 0.1, and then hit Enter. And I can press Ctrl-A and apply the scale. Then I want to rotate the object, and I'll rotate on the X-axis, and I'll type in 90 and Enter, so it's rotated over by 90 degrees. Then I'll go into Edit Mode, and I want to scale this object down on the Y-axis, and I'll make it quite a bit smaller, and then I think I might scale the whole thing up just a little bit. So I'm now going to click here to go to the Face Select, and I will select this face, and Shift-select this face. And I'll press E to extrude, and then S to scale, and I'll scale that up, but I want to just scale it on the Y-axis, so I'll just scale that out on the Y, bring it out maybe about that far, and then I can scale the whole thing down, and maybe scale the whole thing down on the Y-axis a bit. So something like that. Then I will press I again to inset those faces, and just place that there. So now those faces are inset. So I'll go back to Object Mode with the Tab key, and I'm going to press Ctrl-2. Ctrl-2 is going to add a subdivision surface, and then using the Object Context menu, I'll shade this smooth. Then I'm also going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go here and add a UV sphere, and I'll scale the UV sphere way down so it's much smaller, and I'll also press Ctrl-1 just to add a subdivision surface with one level, and then using the Object Context menu, I'll shade that smooth. And I'll bring this here, kind of rotate it over a little bit, and then I'll duplicate this one, maybe move it over here, and kind of rotate that a little bit. And then I'm going to select both of these spheres, and I'll press Ctrl-A, and I will apply the scale, so that's the new default size of the objects. Then I also added a camera by pressing Shift-A, going down here and adding a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you go over here to the Object Data Properties with the camera selected, I turned the focal length up to 70, just so it kind of zooms the camera in a bit. Now as for the lighting, I added these three different area lights right here. So if you press Shift-A, you can go down here to Light and add the area light, and once you add the area light, you can turn the shape here to disk if you want to set it up the same way that I have, so that it is a circular light. So for all of these three lights, I have it as a white color, and I have the power to about four. So I have one light shining on this side, another one on this side, and then another one kind of on the back to give a bit of a rim light. And then also to make the lighting a little bit nicer, if you go over here to the World Properties, I added in this Photo Studio Broadway Hall 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, and I'll have a link in the description if you'd like to download it. So you can just add a new world, and then you can click here on the yellow dot next to Color, and you can choose Environment Texture, and then you can just click on the Open button and open up the downloaded texture. And again, I downloaded the 1K HDR version of the HDRI. And then I set the strength of the HDRI to 0.4, so it's not quite as bright. Now if you go up here to the Render Properties, and go down here to the Color Management, I am using Filmic, and I also changed the look to Very High Contrast, just to pop out the colors and make it look nicer. And then if you open up the Film tab here, I also turned on the Transparent button so that the world lighting is still lighting the scene, but you can't actually see the HDRI in the background. And then also I'm using the Cycles rendering engine, but you could also totally use Eevee if you want to. All right, so I'm going to click right here to go to the Shading workspace. So in the Shading workspace, I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mode. And then I have the Shader Editor right over here. So I'll just click on New to add a new material, and I'll just rename this to Christmas Candy. And if this principled shader looks a little bit different than yours, that is because Blender 4.0 was just recently released, and so they have updated the principled shader. It's still the same shader, but they've just changed the user interface a little bit. So if you don't have Blender 4.0, then you can definitely download it on Blender's website. But you should also be able to follow along in an earlier version of Blender as well. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit, and you can go to the Preferences. And then over there on the Add-ons tab, just search for Node Wrangler, and you can enable the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, we are going to be creating the swirl texture. So I'll press Shift-A, and I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for the gradient texture. Let's drop the gradient here, and then using the feature of the Node Wrangler, you can Control-Shift and then select different nodes. So just hold down the Control and Shift key, and then select different nodes to preview them. So I'm just going to Control-Shift and select the gradient, and you can see it's black over here, and then it gets whiter. And also with the gradient texture selected, I'm going to press Control-T to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I'm going to bring these two nodes over here so we have a bit more space. Now on this gradient texture, I want to click on the type here, and I'm going to change it to a radial instead. And then I also want to click on this mapping node, and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it, and I'm going to drop it here before the gradient, and we'll use this mapping later. Now you can't see the gradient texture, and that is because I want to use the object coordinates. So we're going to take the object, and we're going to put that into the vector, and now you can see that it is black here, and then as it goes around, it gets lighter. So what I want to do is I want to distort the gradient texture so that as it goes out, it's going to rotate. So to do that, we're going to add another gradient texture, and we're going to put it into the rotation, and then that'll distort the rotation. So I'll press Shift-A, and I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for a gradient texture, and we're going to drop it between both of the mapping nodes. Now because this gradient texture is going to distort the rotation of the other texture, we actually want to take the gradient texture color, and we're going to put that into the rotation of this mapping, and then the object coordinates can just go back into the vector of this one. So we'll just drag these two down so we have the mapping and the gradient, and then the object coordinates is going into this one. So then we just have the gradient going into the rotation so that it will distort it. So on this gradient texture, I want to click on the linear, and I'm going to change it to spherical instead. So by being set to spherical, if I Control-Shift and select it to preview it, it's going to be white in the center, and then it's going to get more gray as it goes out on the edges. And it is a little bit hard to see, but you can see it's white here, and then it gets gray there. So I'm going to Control-Shift and select the gradient again. So you can see that it's already started to distort it because it is kind of moving up at a weird angle, but I want to make it stronger. Before I do that though, I don't want it to be distorted on the z-axis, so this mapping node here, we're just going to turn the z to zero, and that way the gradient texture won't really be affected on the z-axis, but it will be affected on the x and y. So we're just turning the z to zero. So now to make that distortion stronger, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for the math node, and we'll put the math node after the gradient texture. And then we want to click on the add here, and we want to change it to multiply instead. So change it to multiply under functions. And now if I turn the value up, you can see it's going to be stronger and stronger and distort more and more as I turn the value up. Now this multiply is going into the rotation, and so it is distorting the x, y, and z values. But instead of it distorting all three of these values, I only want it to distort the z value. So I'll press Shift-A, and I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for the combine x, y, z, and let's just drop this here. And I'm now going to take the vector, and we'll put that into the rotation. So that way these three values are now broken up into these three values. So we can take the multiply, and we can plug that into the z. So the x and y will leave at zero, but I can now just turn the value up, and you can see because it's only controlling the z, it is only going to rotate it around on the z-axis. So if I turn this up to a very large number, you can see we now have that really cool swirl there. Now on the multiply value, I'm going to turn this to 13, because I think 13 is a pretty good size. So now we have one of them, but I want to make many more of those lines, because I want there to be lots of swirls all around. So I'm going to go over here to the gradient. I'm going to box select these nodes and bring them over, and then I'll press shift a, and I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for another math node, and we'll drop the math node after this gradient. And this one as well, we're also going to change it to a multiply. Now before I do anything with this multiply, I also want to click on the multiply, and I'll duplicate it with shift d, drop it here. And I want to click on the multiply, and I want to go down here to rounding, and I'll choose fraction. So now that we've added the fraction and the multiply, I can turn up this value, and you can see the bigger I turn it up, the more of those swirls we're going to have. So I'm going to turn the value up to four, so you can see now there are just four of those lines. And also I'm going to click here, and I'm going to drag and drop this material onto these other objects as well, so we can preview that. All right, so we can now start creating the colors. So I'm going to click and drag to box select these nodes and bring them back, and I'll press shift a, and I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for a color ramp, and we'll drop the color up here after the fraction. Now I'm actually going to use this color ramp to kind of break up these values, so these black and white values, and we're going to use that to create a few more swirls. So what I'm going to do is click and drag, and I'm going to drag the black tab kind of over to about here, and then I'm going to hold down the control key and click here to add another tab, and I'll bring this over. And then this one I'm going to make white. So you can see by having white and then black and then white, it's kind of breaking up those values, so it's kind of changing the colors of those swirls. So this color here, I will put it in about the center. And then I want to make it a mid gray color, so I'll just make it kind of like a mid gray color. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using, you can go over to the hex value and you can punch in 7a, 7a, 7a. And then I'm going to hold down the control key and click here and also hold down the control key and click about there to add two more of them. And then I want both of these colors to be the same color, and I want them to be a bit darker. So if you click here on the tab and go to the hex value here on the hex, I want to use 7f, 7f, 7f. That's the color that I'll be using. And then this color right here, I want to use the same color, so I'll click on the color here, go to the hex, and I'll punch in 7f, 7f, 7f. So now by adding these three gray color tabs right here, you can see that it's making that big gray area in those swirls. So we now have some big gray swirls. Now, before I actually dive into the colors, I want to add a few more detailed lines. So I'm going to click on the multiply and then shift, select the fraction, and I'll press shift to duplicate. And let's drop these nodes up here. And I want to put the colorant color into the multiply. Let me just drag these nodes over and then drag these down. And then I can control shift and select the fraction. So by adding another multiply and another fraction, you can see we're adding a bunch of little lines there in the gray line. And then this value right here, I want to change it to a 5.6. I think a 5.6 is pretty good. But you can see by dragging this value around, we can really change the variation of how the Christmas candy looks. And we'll be using this value later in the custom node group. So now I'm going to create the colors. So I'll give myself a bit more space and then I'll press shift day and I'll go to the search and I'll search for another color ramp. And let's drop this up here and we can put the fraction value into the color ramp and I'll control shift and select it to preview it. So I'm going to drag the black tab over here and the white tab over here. And because I'm going to be creating a customizable node group, I want to be able to have those colors that I can control outside of the node group. So what we're going to do is basically create a few masks with the color ramp, and then we will use the colorant mask in a mix color node and we'll use that to create the custom colors. So I'm first going to just drag this over here and then that over there. So just like that. And that is going to be the first mask. Now for the second mask, I'll select the color ramp and I'll press control shift D. So control shift D will duplicate the node, but keep the wire plugged up and I'll drop it here and I'll control shift and select it to preview it. And then this one, I want to drag the black tab over here and then the white tab I'm going to drag over to about there. So now you can see we have those two different masks. And then there is just one more thing I want to do to the texture. I want to go back over here to this color ramp and I want to drag these white tabs out. And by dragging the white tabs out, it's going to add that little dark area there in that mask. So just drag those white tabs out just like that. All right. So now we can use these two masks and we're going to join them together to create the colors. So I'll press shift A and I'll go to the search and I'm going to search for the mix color and let's drop this up here. And I'm going to take this top color up here and I'm going to put the color into the factor. So by dragging into the factor, the factor is determining what parts are going to be color A and what parts are going to be color B. So I can control shift and select the mix to preview it. So here on color A, I'm going to make this really bright and I'm going to make it a green color. And then here in color B, I'm just going to make this fully white. And if you want to use the same exact color for the green color, then you can go to the hex and you can punch in 00FF18. And then color B is fully white. So I now want to mix this in with the other mask. So I'll click on the mix. I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here. And I want to take the mix result and I'm going to put that into color B. So now we can take this color of color and we can plug that into the factor and I can control shift and select the mix to preview it. So then I want to go here to color A and this color, I am going to make fully red. And if you want to use the same exact red color that I'm using, then here on the red color, you can go to the hex value and you can punch in FF0400. So I can now take the mix result and I can put that into the base color and I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. So now let's do a few more things to the material. So I want to make it more shiny. So I'll just turn the roughness down to a 0.2 and I'm also going to open up the subsurface here and I'll turn the subsurface weight all the way up to one. So there's more subsurface. And then here on the subsurface scale here, I just want to turn this to a 0.1. Now I also want to add a tiny little bit of surface bump. So I'll press shift A and I'll go to the search and I'll search for a noise texture and drop it here. And I can put the factor into the normal. Now there's some weird shading issues and that's because I need to convert the color data into normal data. So I'll press shift A and I'll go to the search and I'll search for the bump node and we'll put the bump node in between the noise texture and the normal. And then I want to take the factor and I'm going to put that into the height value of the bump. And then here on the bump strength, that is a bit too strong. So I'm going to turn that down to a 0.03 on the bump strength. Now I also want to use the object coordinates for the noise texture. So let's go back over here to this texture coordinate and we're going to take the object coordinates and we're going to drag this all the way over and we're going to stick it into the vector of the noise texture. And then I do just want to change a few of the settings. So I'm going to turn up the scale to 200 and then I'll turn the detail up to 5. And this roughness here I'll turn to a 0.588. And then I'll leave the other settings how they are. So if I control shift and select the noise texture, you can see that's what it looks like. And if I control shift and select the bump, you can see it's just going to add that tiny little bit of surface bump. So I'll control shift and select the principal shader. And that is the finished procedural Christmas candy material. So we're now going to be joining this together into a custom node group. So I'll click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output. And I'll press control G to join it together into a node group. And if you press the tab key, that'll go in and out of the node group. So I'll go out of the node group and I'll drag the node group over here and I can drag it out to make it bigger. And then here on the name of the node group, I can just call this Christmas candy. So then let's hit the tab key to go back into the node group and I'll press the N key to open up the side panel. And you can click over here in group. And then here on the interface, you can see right now it's renamed to BSDF, but I want to rename this to shader just because I like that a bit better. So outside of the node group, you can see that it's called shader. So let's go back into the node group. So if you go over here to this side, you can see there is a group input. And so we can plug all the values that we want to control outside of the node group into this group input. So I first want to control the overall scale. And so this first multiply here, you can see that's going to change the scale. So we'll take the value and we'll put that into the group input. And then if I double click on this to rename it, I'm just going to rename it to scale. Then I want to be able to control the colors. So I'll drag the group input right over here, drag it way over here to these colors. And I first want to take this white color and put that into the extra socket. And then the green color, put that into the extra socket. And then the red one here, put that into the extra socket. And if you do want to move these around, you can click and drag and then let go. And that's going to move those around. So I'm going to double click on these to rename them. And I'm going to rename them color one and color two and color three. So now if we go outside of the node group with the tab key, we have those different colors, and that'll control the colors of the material. So we'll go back into the node group. Now I also want to be able to control the amount of swirls. So if I drag this group input back over here, we have this multiply. And if I drag this around, you can see that's controlling how many swirls there are. So I'm going to take the value, put that into the extra socket, and then I can double click on this to rename it. And I'll rename it to amount of swirls. Then I want to be able to control the candy variation to make it look different. So if we go over here to this third multiply, I can drag this value around and you can see it's going to randomize the candy. So this is a great way to make lots of variations of the candy just by dragging this around. So let's put the value into the extra socket there. And then I can double click on this to rename it. And I'll rename this one to candy variation. And then I want to be able to control the roughness of the material. So let's go here to the principle shader and I can take the roughness and I can put that into the extra socket. And then I'll drag the group input down here. And I also want to be able to control the noise scale. So I'll put that into the extra socket. So the noise scale, we can control that as well. And this one, I'll double click on it to rename it. And I'm going to rename it to a bump scale. And then I want to be able to control the bump strength. So let's put the strength here, the bump into the extra socket. And then if I double click on this, I can rename it to bump strength. All right. So I can drag the group input right over here and drag it underneath the texture coordinate. And I'll hit the tab key to go outside of the node group and the N key to close the side panel. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the material. And then we also have the different colors. So colors one, two, and three. And I have them as green and red because those are classic Christmas colors. Then we have the amount of swirls. So I can make more swirls if I want. Then we have this cool candy variation value. So you can drag this around to make the candy texture look very different. Then we also have the roughness of the material and the bump scale and then also the bump strength. So that's going to be it for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed this and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eSwHK3HMZc,Procedural Quartz Rock Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on creating a procedural quartz rock material in Blender. It walks through the process of setting up the procedural node setup, joining it into a custom node group, and adjusting various material properties such as texture scale, colors, crack depth, noise settings, roughness, bump strength, and displacement strength. Additionally, the tutorial covers setting up the 3D viewport, adding geometry and lighting, and employing Node Wrangler for node manipulation. The video concludes by offering the option to purchase the material and other procedural materials from the creator's Gumroad store, Patreon page, and material pack.","In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural quartz rock material in Blender. So after we create the procedural node setup, I will show you how to join the material together into this custom node group so that you can control the material. So let's just review the material. So we have the overall scale here to change the size of the texture. And then we also have some different colors here. So we have colors one and two. Then we have the cracks depth. So those cracks can be deeper or less deep. Then we also have some noise settings. So we have the noise scale. We also have the noise detail. And we also have the noise roughness and then the noise distortion. And then we also have the roughness of the rock. And we also have the bump strength to add that surface bump. And then finally, we have the displacement strength to pop out the mesh. And if you'd like to purchase this material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. The links are in the description. And if you like using procedural materials in your projects, then definitely check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack, which has all of my procedural materials pre-set up for Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. And to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. All right, so I'll now show you the 3D setup if you want to set up the 3D viewport the same way that I have. So I press Shift-A, I went here to Mesh, and I added an icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click on that little Add Icosphere Settings, I'm going to turn the subdivisions up to 6, because I want lots of even geometry so that the displacements have geometry to actually pop the mesh out. And then I will close the Add Icosphere Settings, and let's use the Object Context menu to shade the object smooth. Now, this object is quite large, and when modeling to the real-life scale in Blender, the default primitive objects are a little bit higher than an average human, so this is quite large. So let's make this smaller to a better size for a rock. So I will scale this down, and let's just type in 0.18 and then hit Enter. So that is a much better size. And then I will press Ctrl-A and just apply the object's scale. So I now want to add a couple other smaller rocks, so I'll press Shift-A, I'll go to Mesh, and I'll add another icosphere. But then if you click right behind me on the little Add Icosphere Settings, this one, I'm just going to turn the subdivisions to 2, because this is quite smaller, so we don't need as much geometry. And then I can close the Add Icosphere Settings. Now this one I want to make much smaller, so I will scale it down, and I'll type 0.07 and then Enter, so it's much smaller. And then I will kind of move it over here behind the larger one. And then I'll select this object, press Ctrl-A, and I will apply the scale, and then using the Object Context menu, I'll shade the object smooth. And then I want to make one more, so I'll duplicate this, and I'll scale it down a bit more, and then you can just press Ctrl-A and again apply the scale, maybe make that a little bit bigger. Now I want to give these objects even more geometry, so that the displacement looks more detailed. So if I select this object here, I'll press Ctrl-1, and that is going to add a subdivision surface with one level. So you can see right over here, if you go to the Modifier Properties, you can see the Levels viewport is 1, and I want the render to be 1 as well. Then I will select this object here, and I'll press Ctrl-3, and this will add another subsurf, but it's going to change the viewport levels to 3, and I'll turn that up as well so it's both 3. And then the same thing here, click on this object, Ctrl-3, and set the render and viewport to 3. So these objects now have lots of geometry. So I'm now going to select all of the objects, and I'll hit the Tab key to go into Edit Mode. And then what I'm going to do is hit the O key, and that is going to turn on this proportional editing here. So I now want to change the shape of the rocks. So I will select a vertex down here and hit G to grab, and I can move this up, kind of just stretch that up there. And if it's acting kind of laggy in the viewport, then here on the Levels viewport, we can just turn this to 0 so that you can't see the subsurf. So now I can just select some vertices and bring this up, and you can scroll with your mouse wheel to change the size of the proportional editing. And I will make the bottom of the rock kind of flat, and then I'll also select the side here and kind of pull that out and just make the rock kind of a random shape. And then I'll do the same thing for these objects. So I'll select these objects here, maybe flatten the bottom, and then kind of pull some of the vertices around, something like that. And also right here, just kind of pull that around, stretch it out, so they kind of look like rocks. Then I also press Shift-A, and I went down here to Camera and just added a camera, and I just placed the camera pointing at the objects. And if you select the camera and then click over here on the Object Data Properties, the Camera Settings, I turned the focal length up to 80 just because it kind of zooms in the camera and makes things look a bit more flat. Now as for the lighting, I added in these three area lights here. So if you press Shift-A, you can go down here to Light, and you can add the area light. So I added these three area lights, and I have two here on the back to kind of give a rim light, and then this one here on the top. And this light over here, I turned it to a power of 65. This light here, I turn it to a power of 50. And then the one up here, I turn this to a power of 30. Now also to give some nice realistic lighting and reflections to the objects, I went here to the World Properties, and I added this Bathroom 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Link will be in the description if you'd like to download it. And again, I downloaded the 1K HDR version on polyhaven. So once you download the HDRI, you can add a new world. And here on Color, you can click on the yellow dot and choose Environment Texture, and then you can click on the Open button and open up the HDRI. So now what I'll do is hold down the Z button and move my mouse up into the rendered view. Now you can see I have the background transparent, and that is because I went here to the Render Properties, and I opened up the Film tab, and then I checkmarked the Transparent button. So that way, the HDRI will still light the scene, but you can't see it in the background. So you can do that if you want to. And then also right here on the Color Management, I changed the View Transform to Filmic and the Look to High Contrast to make the colors look nicer. So I'm in the Shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the rendered mode, and then I have the Shader Editor right here. So let's click on one of these objects, and we will click on New to add a new material to the object. And I will rename this material to Quartz Rock. And then I'm going to click and drag, and I'm going to drop the material from this material slot here, and I'm going to drop it onto the other objects so that they all have the same material. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So to enable the Node Wrangler, you can click on Edit, and you can go to the Preferences, and then over there on the Add-ons tab, just search for Node Wrangler, and you can checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So now let's create the material. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'll go here to the Search, and I'm going to start by searching for a brick texture. Let's drop the brick texture down here, and I'm going to be using it to make the displacement. And then also with the brick texture selected, I'll press Control-T to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes, and let's use the object coordinates because the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. And then because we turned on the Node Wrangler, I can Control-Shift and select the brick texture, and that is going to preview it on the objects. So we can now change the settings of the brick texture. So here on Color 1, I'm going to click and drag Color 1, and I'm going to drop the color onto Color 2, so that they both have the same color. And then here on the scale, I want to change this to like a 1.2, so that it is smaller. And then here on the mortar size, I want to make this smaller, so I'll turn it to like a .075. And then I want to make the mortar very smooth, so I'll turn that all the way up to 1, so you can see it is now smooth on the edges. And I'll leave the other settings how they are. Now I want to add another texture to distort the brick texture, because right now it's really straight. So I'll press Shift-A, and I'll go to the search, and I'll search for a noise texture. And let's drop the noise texture in between the mapping and the brick texture. So because the noise texture is going through the mapping, it's going through the vector here, it's distorting the placement of the Voronoi texture. So let's now change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale of the noise to like a 2. Let's also turn the detail to the max of 15. And then here on the roughness, I'll turn this up a little bit to like a .55. And then also the distortion, I'm going to turn this up to like a .2. So now you can see it is distorting that brick texture. However, it's distorting it way too much, and so I want the noise texture to have less of an effect over the Voronoi. So I'll press Shift-A, and I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for the mix color node, and let's drop the mix color in between the noise texture and the brick texture. So now what we can do is we can take the original mapping, which isn't distorted at all, and we can mix it in with the mix. And so we're going to mix between the mapping and the noise. So let's take the color here from the noise texture, and I'll put that into color B. And then this mapping vector, which isn't distorted at all, we can put that into color A. So now we're mixing between the mapping and the noise. And so now if you drag the factor around, you can see it's blending between only using the mapping or only using the noise. Now you can see the texture is moving around a lot when I move the factor. So to fix that, I am going to click on the mix here, and I'm going to change this to the linear light instead. So now when I drag the factor, it's distorting the texture, but it's not moving it around. So I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.35, just so that it's not quite as distorted. And so this is what we're going to be using in the displacement to make the darker parts going into the mesh. Now as well as that, I do just want to mix in some more noise to the texture. So I'm going to click on this linear light here, and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate. Let's drop it here. And then I want to take this brick texture, and let's put the color into color B. And I can Control-Shift and select this mix color. Now I want to mix this in with the noise texture, so I want to mix the noise texture into the brick. So I'll take the factor here, and I'm going to put that into color A. And then I just want to add the dark values of this noise texture. We're basically just going to add it on top. So let's click on the linear light here, and I can change it to darken instead. So if I now turn up the factor, you can see it's going to add the dark values. So I'm going to turn the factor just to like a 0.1. So that is very subtle, but that'll be better for the displacement. So let's add the displacement so we can see what it's doing. So I'll press Shift-A, and I'll go to the search, and I'll add the displacement. So we're going to add the displacement node, drop it here. And I want the displacement to be going here into the displacement of the material output. And then we want to take the darken result, and we want to put that into the height value of the displacement, and that way it'll actually convert it to displacement data. Now you can see nothing is happening, the mesh isn't popping out, and that is because we need to go over here to the material properties. And we need to go down here and open up the settings, and we want to go down here to the surface, and we want to change the displacement to displacement and bump. And this is telling the material to use the displacement. So now this displacement node is converting the darken into displacement data. And we now have the scale value, and the scale value is going to change how strong it is. So let's turn the scale down because it is way too strong right now. So I'm going to turn the scale down to like a 0.2. So now if you kind of look here in the areas where those cracks are, it's going back in. So just to show you, if I turn the factor all the way up to 1, if I turn the factor up to 1, it's adding all those dark values. And so you can see where those darker parts are from the brick texture, that is going way down into the mesh. And then the lighter parts are popping back out. But that is way too strong, so then we can drag this factor around to make it more subtle. So I find that a factor of 0.1 works pretty good. And then also this factor here, that is controlling how much it's distorted. So you can see it's way distorted or very little distorted. So I'm just going to leave it there how it is. So then let's Ctrl Shift and select the principled shader. So that's actually using the principled as the shader. And now you can see we have lots of detail. You can see there's those little cracks or crevices there, and that is the brick texture. So I want to keep my nodes nicely organized. So what I'm going to do is click and drag to box select all of these nodes here. These are all of the displacement nodes. And I'll press Ctrl J to join them all together into a frame. And with the frame selected, I can press F2 to add a label. And I can just call this displacement. And then I want to click and drag to box select these two nodes here. And I will press Ctrl J to join them both together into a frame as well. And I'll click on the frame and press F2 to add a label. And I'll call this mapping. All right, so I now want to create another texture up here, which is going to go into the base color. So I'll press Shift A, and I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for a noise texture. And let's Ctrl Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So I want to take the mapping, let's take the vector and put that into the vector, the noise texture, so that it's using the object coordinates. And then let's change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to eight. And I'll turn the detail up to the max of 15. And let's add a bit more roughness. So I'll turn this up to like a point six. And I want to add a bit more distortion just a little bit. So I'll turn it to a 2.8. So now you can see there's a little bit of distortion kind of around that noise texture. Now I want to make this more interesting. So I want to distort it with a another texture kind of like how we did down here. So I'll press Shift A, then I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. And let's drop the Voronoi texture between the mapping and the noise. And so because it's going through the vector, it's going to distort the placement of the noise texture. And we actually want to use the distance value instead. So let's put the distance into the vector. Now I want to make this much less strong because the Voronoi texture is distorting it way too much. So I'll press Shift A and I'll go to the search. And I'll search for another mix color. And let's drop the mix color in between the Voronoi texture and the noise texture. So I want to use this mix here to mix between the Voronoi which is distorting it and the mapping which isn't distorting it at all. So I'm going to take the vector here and let's put that into color A. And then this Voronoi distance, let's put that into color B. So if I now drag the factor around, you can see it's going to distort it more or less. And just like we did down here with this other setup, I want to change the mix here, I want to change it the type to linear light. And that way, when I drag it around, it's not moving the texture around quite as much. Now I want to make this very, very subtle. So I'm going to turn the factor to a point 065. So that way is distorting it but just by a very small amount. So before I plug this into the base color, I do want to change the colors of it. So I'll press Shift A, then I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for a color ramp because I want to make it more contrasty. So let's drop the color ramp after the noise texture because I basically just want to make the black colors darker. So let's click on the black tab here. And if I drag the black tab towards the white tab, it's going to make it more contrasty. So I'm just going to drag it to about there. So it's a bit darker. And I can drag the principled shader back, just move it out of the way for now. So we now have the black color and the white color, but I want to change those colors and make it more look like that quartz rock. So I'll press Shift A and I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for another mix color node. And let's put the mix color node here after the color ramp. And why I'm using this mix color instead of the color ramp is because I want to be able to control the colors outside of the custom node group. And so we can use this mix to do that. So let's take the color here and I can put that into the factor. So the factor value determines what parts are going to be color A and what parts are going to be color B. So that's going to be the black here and the white here. So we can now make the two colors for color A and B. So here in color B, I just want to make this fully white. And then here on color A, I want to make this a light color and I want to make it a very slight tannish color. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using here in color A, then you can go to the hex value. And I'm going to be using a hex value of BC A997. So you can punch that in if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using. So we now have a nice color there for the quartz rock. So we can now take the mix result and let's put that into the base color of the principled shader. And I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And let's drag the principled shader up here. And then again, to keep my nodes nicely organized, I want to click and drag the box, select all these nodes here, and I will press control J to join them together into a frame. And if you want to, you can kind of compress them down, make it look nice and neat. And then if you select the frame, you can press F2 to add a label. And I'm just going to rename this to color. All right, so I now want to make the rock more shiny. So let's go here to the roughness. And I'm going to turn the roughness way down to a point zero five, so that the rock is nice and shiny. Now you can see that the rock still isn't see through, you can't really see through the rock, but we are going to add that later. But the next thing that I want to do is add a little bit more surface bump. So I'll press shift a and I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for another noise texture. Let's drop the noise texture here. And then again, I want to use the object coordinates. So let's plug the vector here into the vector of the noise texture. And then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And let's change some of the settings. So I want to turn the scale to like a 7.3. And again, let's make it very detailed. So I'll turn the detail to the very max of 15. And I'll turn the roughness up to a point five five, I like that value and the distortion here, I'll turn that up to a small number like a point two. So now we can use this noise texture here. And we can put that into the normal to give it some more surface bump. So let's put the factor into the normal. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader. Now you can see something is wrong with the texture, it's really dark. And that is because we need to convert the black and white data here from the noise texture into normal data that the shader can use. So I'll press shift a and I'll go to the search. And I'll search for the bump node. And let's put the bump node in between the noise texture and the normal. And then we actually want to put the noise texture factor into the height value. So it converts it to normal data. So you can see now it is adding all that surface bump. Now that is a bit too bumpy. So I'm going to turn the strength here to just like a point three on the bump. So now it just adds a bit more surface detail to that row. And I will click and drag bring this over here. And I'm going to click and drag to select both of these nodes. And I'll press Ctrl J to join it together into a frame. And with the frame selected, I'll press F2 and I can just call this bump. Alright, so this is really starting to look like a quartz rock, but it still isn't see through. So I'm going to be adding another shader and that shader is going to be see through. So let's click on the principled shader. I'll press shift to duplicate it. And let's drop it up here. And I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And then also, I want the same bump normal to be going into the normal of this principled shader as well. So now to make this look like a quartz rocks that you can see through it, I want to turn up the transmission value. So this transmission, I'm going to turn it up to like a point eight. And now it looks much more like glass. So you can actually see through the quartz rock, but I don't want it to be fully see through, I don't want to be able to see through the entire thing. I want some parts to be a bit less see through and then other parts to be more see through with this transmission. So we are going to mix these two principled shaders together. So I'll press shift a and I'll go to the search. And I'll search for the mix shader. And let's drop the mix shader here in this wire. And I want to plug this principled shader up to the bottom one. And then this principled shader will plug that to the top one. So now if I drag the factor value, that's blending between the two shaders, I want to create another texture so that some parts are more see through and some parts are less see through. So to do that, I'll press shift a and I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for another noise texture. Let's drop the noise texture here. And again, I want to use the object coordinates. So let's take the mapping vector, and I can put that into the vector of the noise texture. And then let's control shift and select it to preview it. So I want to turn the scale to like an eight. And look, again, let's turn the detail all the way to the max of 15. And I'll leave the other settings how they are. So now I want to make this much more contrasty because right now if I put the factor into the factor here at the mix shader, and control shift and select the mix shader to preview it, it is working a little bit, but I want it to be more clear where it's visible and where it's not visible. So I'll press shift a and I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for another color ramp. And let's drop the color ramp right here after the noise texture. So I can now take the black tab and I can drag it over. And I can take the white tab and drag that over. So if I drag them really, really close to each other, it's going to be very easy to see the difference. So there you can see through the rock, but then here you can't, but that is a bit too strong and I want to make it more subtle. So I'll drag the white tab to about here. And then this black tab, I'll drag kind of back to about there. So if I control shift and select it, you can see what it's doing. So I'll now control shift and select the mix shader to preview it. And I might even drag the white tab back a little bit more. So now you can see some parts of the quartz rock, you can see through it and then other parts you can't. And that is it. So that is the finished procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join this together into a custom node group. So I'm going to click and drag the box, select all the nodes except the material output, and I'll press control G control G will join it together into a node group. Now if you press the N key to open up the side panel, we have inputs and outputs. And so we can customize the inputs and outputs to make the customizable node group. So let's click on the shader here. And I want the shader to be on top. So click on the shader. And then you can click on this error here to bring it up. So then you can come over here and find the group input node, and I'll drag the group input down here. And we can plug any values up into the group input. And then if we hit the tab key to go outside of the node group, we'll be able to control those values outside of the node group. Let's grab the node group and bring it over here. And I can click here and drag it out to make it a bit bigger. And then I want to make the name of the node group the same name as the quartz rock. So I'll click here, and I'll copy the name with Ctrl C, and then click here and press Ctrl V to paste the quartz rock. So now we have this custom node group. So let's hit the tab key to go back into the node group. And then here on the group input, we want to plug up all the custom values. So I first want to control the overall scale of the entire material. And this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures. So it'll control all of the textures scale. So let's put the scale into the group input there. And then if I click on the scale here on the inputs, I want it to just be one single value, not three. So if I click on the type here, I want to change it to float instead. So it is one single value. Now here on the default value, I just want this to be one. And then if we hit the tab key to go outside of the node group, I want to turn the scale back to one. So now that's controlling the scale of the material. So let's hit the tab key to go back into the node. Now I also want to be able to control the colors. So let's click on the group input, and we can drag it way up here. And then we can take the color here, color A, we'll put that into the extra socket, and color B, put that into the extra socket of the group input. And then we can double click on this to rename this. And I'll rename this one to color one, and then be here, double click on this, and I'll rename this to color two. Now if the group input accidentally gets put in the frame here, you can press Alt P and Alt P will take it out of the frame. So I now want to be able to control the cracks depth. So if I drag the group input right down here, if I go over here to this darken, if I drag the darken, you can see that's going to control the depth of those cracks. So let's put the factor into the extra socket here. And then if I double click on this to rename it, I'll rename this one to cracks depth. And then I want to control a bunch of the noise settings. So let's drag the group input over here. And we have this noise texture here and I want to be able to control these values. So let's put the scale into the extra socket. And we'll do the same for the detail and also the roughness and also the distortion. And then here on the names, I want to click here and I want to type in noise. So I'm going to rename this one to noise scale. And then this one here, noise detail, noise roughness, and noise distortion. So now if we go outside of the node group, you can see we have all of those different sliders to control the noise. So let's go back into the node group. Now I also want to be able to control the roughness of the material. So let's drag this right over here. And if I go right up here to the roughness values, the roughness values are exactly the same on both of these shaders. So I'm going to take the roughness here, let's drag that into the extra socket here. And then I'll take this roughness value here. And I'm going to drag that into the same socket. And because they're going into the same socket, this single roughness value is going to control both roughness of both of the shaders. And then I also want to be able to control the bump strength. So let's take the strength here, I can put that into the extra socket. And if I double click on this, I'll rename it to bump strength. And then the last value that I want to control is the displacement strength. So here in the displacement, we can take the scale, let's put that into the extra socket here. And then if I double click on this to rename it, I'll rename it to displacement strength. Alright, so I can drag the group input right over here, I'll just stick it down here underneath the mapping. And you can hit the tab key to go out of the node group. And you can press the N key to close the side panel. And here is the finished procedural quartz rock material. So we can now just review the material. So we have the overall scale. And we also have the different colors. So we have color one here. And then we also have color two, then we have the cracks depth, so you can turn that down if you want to make those cracks have more depth. We also have a bunch of settings here for the noise. So with the noise scale, and also the noise detail and the noise roughness, if you want to make it much more detailed, and also that noise distortion, and then we have the roughness of the material, but I want to keep it very far down so that it's very shiny. And then we have the bump strength, and that is the surface bump. And then finally, we have the displacement strength. So that's going to be it for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed the tutorial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CFEQTs0LQ0,Procedural White Brick Material (Blender Tutorial),"This Blender tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural white brick material and integrate it into a custom node group for easier control over material settings. The tutorial covers various adjustable parameters, including overall scale, color options, color brightness, ambient occlusion for dirt effects in cracks, material roughness, and bump strengths for bricks and noise. It also guides viewers through setting up the 3D environment with objects to preview the material and lighting adjustments using HDRI. The video concludes by offering the procedural material for purchase on Gumroad and promoting additional resources on the creator's Patreon page.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural white brick material. And after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join the material together into a custom node group so you can control the material settings. So let's just run through these. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the bricks. And then we also have some different colors here, so color 1 and 2. Then we also have the color brightness. And because these are light bricks, I did want to add that color brightness so you can make the bricks darker or lighter. Then we also have this cool ambient occlusion value. And so this is if you're creating some sort of brick building and you want to make it look like maybe there's some dirt in the corners here in the cracks and crevices, you can turn up this ambient occlusion value to make it darker there in the cracks and make it look like there's some dirt. Or you can turn it down if you don't want to use it. Then we have the roughness of the material, but I'd leave this pretty high because brick is pretty rough. And then we have two bump strengths. So we have the noise bump strength. So if you want to make it look very rough and bumpy, you could turn that up. Then we also have the bricks bump strength to pop out the bricks if you want to make those bricks come out more. And if you'd like to help support me and this YouTube channel, then a great way to do that is by purchasing the procedural material on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description. And if you like using procedural materials in your projects, then definitely check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack.

And if you'd like to learn how to create more procedural materials, then definitely check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. All the links are in the description. So I'll now show you the 3D setup if you want to set up the Blender file the same way that I have. So I'm going to add some objects to preview the material on. So I'll press Shift-A. And I'm going to go here to Mesh. And I'm going to add an icosphere. And I like to add an icosphere because they're nice and round and have even geometry. Now, right behind me, if you click on that arrow there for the Add Icosphere Settings, I'm going to turn these subdivisions up to 6 so that it is nice and smooth and round. And then I will just close the Add Icosphere Settings. So I now want to scale this down to a better size because the default objects in Blender are a little bit larger than an average human. So this is really big. So I'm going to scale this object down. I'll type in 0.2 and then Enter. And then I will press Control-A and apply the scale. So this is the object's new default size. And then using the Object Context menu, I'll shade the object smooth so that it is nice and smooth. Then I'll press Shift-A. I'll go to Mesh. And I'm going to add a cube. And again, with this cube, I'll scale it down by 0.2 and hit Enter. And I'll bring the cube down and then maybe bring both of these objects up a bit. And then I'll select the cube, press Control-A, and also apply the scale. And I'm adding a cube because I want to be able to preview what the ambient occlusion will look like in the creases and crevices. So this would be for something like if I were creating a brick building and I wanted the brick building to look like it kind of has dirt in the creases. So I'm going to move this cube over a bit, move it over here. And I'll go into Edit Mode. And I'm going to click here to go to the Face Select. I'll select this face and I'll extrude it out. Then I'll select this face and extrude it out so that we basically have this little crevice right there. And then I'll go back to Object Mode. And then with this cube selected, if you click right over here to go to the modifiers, I'm going to click on Add Modifier. And I'm going to add a bevel just so that we have a bevel on the edges there. But then the bevel is way too big. So let's turn the amount way down to a very small number. And then let's also turn the segments way up to like a five. And then if you zoom way in closely, I need to use the Object Context menu to shade this smooth so the edges are smooth. And just make that a tiny little bevel there. Now as for the lighting, I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. And I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections. So once you download the HDRI, you can go here to the World Properties. And you can click here on the yellow dot next to Color. And you can choose Environment Texture. And then just click on the Open button and open up the HDRI. And then here on the Strength, I just turned it down to a 0.8 so it's not quite as bright. And then I'm going to hold down the Z button. And I'm going to move my mouse up into the rendered mode so I can see this in the rendered view. And you can see this is what the HDRI lighting gives us. Now you can't actually see the HDRI in the background here in my scene. And that's because if you go over here to the Render Properties, you can open up the Film tab right here. And you can checkmark the Transparent button. And so that way, you can't see the HDRI in the background. But it's still going to light the scene. And I do like that because that way, the HDRI isn't quite as distracting. And then also, if you close the Film tab and you open up the Color Management, I'm going to be using the View Transformer Filmic. And I'll change the look to Very High Contrast. And that'll just pop out the colors and make the render look nicer. Now as far as the rendering engine goes, I am going to be using the Cycles rendering engine because I am going for realism. However, you could also do this tutorial in Eevee. The material will work fine in Eevee. If you are using the Eevee rendering engine, though, when you change it over to Eevee, you just need to make sure to turn on the ambient occlusion so that it will use the ambient occlusion that we're going to be adding to the material. If you're using Cycles render, the ambient occlusion will automatically work. So you can see right here, I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here and I'm in the rendered mode. And then I also have the shader editor right here. So I'll just click on New to add a new material. And right here on the material name, I'll rename this to White Bricks. And then I'm also going to click and drag. And I'm going to drop this material onto this object here so they both have the same material. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit. You can go to the Preferences. And then over there on the Add-ons tab, just search for Node Wrangler. And you can checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. And I'll show you how to use the Node Wrangler in the video. So I'll start by pressing Shift-A. Then I'll go here to the search. And I'm going to start by adding the brick texture. Let's drop the brick texture here. And then using the feature of the Node Wrangler, I can Control-Shift and select the brick texture. And if you hold down the Control and Shift key and then select different nodes, that is going to preview the node on the object. And make sure you're in the rendered mode so you can see it. Now, with this brick texture selected, I'm also going to press Control-T. And that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes after the brick texture. And so the texture coordinate and mapping is telling the brick texture how it's going to be placed on the object. Now, usually for procedural materials, I like to use the object coordinates so you can put the object into the vector. However, for the brick texture, this doesn't work so well because you can't see the bricks on every single side. You can only see it on the top one here. So I am instead going to use the UV. So we'll plug the UV up to the vector. And so now it's going to use the UV mapping of each object to place the brick texture on the object. So now just to fix the UV mapping, I'm going to leave this one how it is. But then this object here, I will go into Edit mode. And I will select the entire object. And then I will click U to unwrap. And for an object like this, which is very simple and blocky, I'm just going to do the Smart UV Project and then click on OK. So you can now see we have a nice UV unwrap. And you can see the bricks are all going sideways over here. And then you can also see the bricks here and over here. And if you wanted to, you could go into Blender's UV editor. And you could rotate the UVs and scale them. And I do have a beginner tutorial on UV unwrapping. So if you'd like to check out that tutorial, I will have the link in the description. But this UV unwrap will work great for what I'm doing. So now let's change the settings of the brick texture. So I want to make this very small. So I'm going to turn the scale to 30 on the bricks. And then here on this color, I want it to be the same color as this top one here. So I'm going to click and drag. And then I can actually drop this color onto the bottom color so that they're the same color. And then the mortar color, that's going to be fully black. Now here on the mortar size, I want to change this to a 0.055 so that it is actually a bit thicker. And then I do want to make the mortars more smooth. So here on this value, I'll turn this to a 0.8. You can actually drag this out so it's a bit bigger. So the mortar smooth, I'll turn to a 0.8. And then I will leave the other settings how they are. Now this brick texture is very smooth. And so I want to add a noise texture to distort those black areas so that it looks more organic and natural. And it makes it look a bit more worn. So I'm going to click and drag to select these two nodes here and drag them back. And then here in the middle, I'll press Shift-A. And I'll go to the search. And I'll search for a noise texture. And we can just drop the noise texture right here. And let's take the mapping vector. And we can plug that up to the vector of the noise texture. And then I can Control-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And now let's change the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 100 so it is much smaller. I'm also going to turn the detail all the way to the max of 15. And then here on this roughness, I will turn the roughness to a 0.55 so it's a little bit more rough. So I now want to mix the noise texture into the vector. And the vector is controlling how the brick texture is placed on the object. And so the noise texture will distort it. So to do this, I'll press Shift-A. And I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for the mix color. And let's drop the mix color right here. And we're actually going to put it in this wire between the mapping and the vector. Now I'm going to take the noise texture factor. And I'm going to put that into color B. And then this mapping vector is going to be into color A. So now I can Control-Shift and select the bricks texture to preview it. And I want to click on this mix here. And I'm going to change the type to linear light instead. So I can now drag the factor around. And you can see if the factor is turned to 0, the noise texture isn't distorting it at all. But then as I drag up the factor, it's going to distort it more and more. So I want the factor to be a very, very small number. So I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.002 so that it is a very small number. So now if I zoom in here to the bricks, you can see it's mostly retaining its shape. But there's a little bit of noise on the edges. So that will make it look more organic and natural. So I now want to create the colors for the brick. So I'll press Shift-A. And I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for another mix color. And let's drop this mix color after the brick texture. And I can Control-Shift and select the mix to preview it. So I want this brick texture to be going into the factor. And then here on this mix, we can make the two colors. So here on color A, I'm going to make this kind of like a grayish color. And if you want to use the exact same hex value that I'm using for color A, then here on the hex, you can punch in 7F7877. So that's the exact color I'm using for color A. And then here on color B, I'm just going to make this fully bright. So you can now see that the mortar is kind of gray, but then the bricks are very light. So I can now click and drag to select these nodes and bring them over here. And before I plug the mix into the base color, there's still two more things that I want to add to this color. So I want to add some overall noise to the material. And then I also want to add that ambient occlusion. So I'm first going to add the noise. So I'll click on this mix. I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it and drop it here after this one. And I'll put this mix result into color A. And then for color B, I'm going to go back here to this noise texture. And I'll take the factor. And I'll put that into color B. So now we're mixing in that noise. And then I can drag the factor to have more of the bricks or more of the noise. And here on the factor, I'm going to turn this to like a 0.75 so you can see the bricks, but the noise is kind of mixed in there. Now, I also want to mix in the ambient occlusion. So right up here, I'll press Shift-A. And I'll go to the search. And I'll search for the ambient occlusion. Let's drop the ambient occlusion right here. And I'm going to Control-Shift and select the ambient occlusion to preview it. And you can see that it's right there. It's kind of dark there. And here on the distance value, I will turn this up to 10. Now, I mentioned this earlier. But if you're using the Eevee rendering engine, it will work in Eevee. However, you need to make sure you checkmark the ambient occlusion so that you can see it in Blender Eevee. But I'm using Cycles, so the ambient occlusion will already work on default. Now, I want to be able to see the ambient occlusion better. So I'll press Shift-A. And I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for this color ramp. And I'll put the color ramp after the ambient occlusion. So if I now drag the black tab and the white tab together, it's going to make it more contrasty. So I'll drag the black tab here and then the white tab kind of to about there. So you can now see in the crevices and creases, you can see those dark values. And also, when you drag two objects together, when the objects are closer together, you're going to be able to see the ambient occlusion. And if you don't want that to happen, you can choose the only local. And that way, the objects won't affect each other. But I actually want to leave this off because if I have two objects close together, I do want there to be kind of a darker area to make it look like there's some dirt kind of in those creases. So I now want to mix in the ambient occlusion. So I'll click and drag to box select these nodes. I'll bring them back. And I'm going to take this mix here. I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it and drop it here. And I want to take this color ramp, and I'm going to put that into color B. Then here on this mix, I'm going to put that into color A. Now I just want to add the dark values. So where the ambient occlusion is, that's dark. So I just want to add those dark parts. So I'm going to click on the mix here, and I'm going to change this to darken. And then I can Control-Shift and select it to preview it. So now if I drag the factor, you can see it's just adding the dark values on top of the other texture. So here on the factor, I'm going to turn this to 0.4 so that it is very subtle. But if you want to turn it up and make the ambient occlusion stronger, you could turn the factor up. So I can now take this darken, and I can put the result into the base color of the principled shader. And I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And I can kind of zoom out here to see how that is looking. So there's a few more things that I want to add to the material. So this roughness value, I'm going to turn this up to like a 0.8 so that it is more rough. And then I also want to add some data into the normal to give it some bump. So I'm first going to take this brick texture here. I'll take the color, and I'll plug that into the normal to make it bumpy. Now, you can see there's some weird shading issues. And that's because I need to press Shift-A. I need to go to the search. And I need to search for a bump node. And the bump node is going to convert the color data into normal data that the shader can use. So I'm going to drop the bump node in between the brick texture color and then also the normal. So this brick texture color needs to be going into the height value of the bump. And then the height will convert it to normal data. So then the bump can go into the normal. So now you can see it actually looks like the bricks are popping out. And here on the strength, I'm going to turn this down to like a 0.3 so that it's not quite as bumpy. But now the bricks are popping out. Then I also want to click on the bump node. And I want to press Shift-D to duplicate it and drop it here. And I'm going to put this normal into the other normal. So this way, we can mix multiple bump maps together. So then in this bump, I'm going to be adding the noise. So I'm going to take this noise texture factor and I'm going to plug that into the height value of this bump right here. So then if I turn the strength up, you can see it's adding all that noisy bump to the material. And I'm just going to turn the strength of this one to a 0.2 so it is much less strong. But you can see it's still giving some bump over the material. And so that is it. That is the finished procedural material. So I'm now going to show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So I'm going to click and drag to box select all these nodes here. But I'm not going to select the material output or the texture coordinate, but all the nodes in between. So I'm now going to press Control-G. And Control-G is going to join the nodes together into a node group. So if I press the N key, that will open up the side panel. And I have the inputs and the outputs. So here on this output, I like to just rename it to Shader because I like that better. So then if you hit the Tab key with the node group selected, that's going to go in and out of the node group. So then I can click on this texture coordinate here, drag this over. And then here on the node group, I just want to make it a bit bigger. So I'm going to click and drag to make that bigger. And this material output, I'll drag that over as well. And then I want to rename the node group. So I'm going to rename it to the same material name. So the material is named White Bricks. So now I can click on the node group and hit the Tab key to go into the node group. And we can add all the custom values to the inputs. So right here, we can take this group input. And we can drag it down here. And we can plug all the values into it. So I want to be able to control the overall size of the entire material. So we can take this scale here from the mapping. And we can plug that into the extra socket. And because the mapping is plugged up to all the other textures, that'll control the entire scale of the entire material. Now, if you go out of the node group, you can see there are actually three values. So to make it one value instead, I'll go back into the node group. I'll click on the scale here on the inputs. And on the type here, I want to change it to float instead so it is one single value. And then here on the default value, I can turn that to one. And I can go out of the node group. And then here on the scale, I want to turn that back to one because it was just turned to zero. So now you can see that is changing the entire size of the material. So let's go back into the node group. And real quick, if you're wondering why I don't have the texture coordinate in the brick texture node group, that is because maybe in some cases you might want to use the object coordinates instead. So I want to make that available for the user. So if they want to use the UVs, they can, or they can use the object coordinates instead if they want to. So let's click on the node group and hit the tab key to go back into the node group. So now I'm going to be adding in the colors. So I'll click on the group input here and I'm going to drag it over. And I can take both of these colors here on the mix. I'll put A into the extra socket and also B, put that into the extra socket. And then I can click on these to rename them. So I'll rename this one to color one. And then this one here, I'll double click on this and I'll rename it to color two. Now, I also want to be able to control the color brightness. So to do that, I'll press shift A and I'll go to the search and I'll search for the hue saturation value. And let's put that in between the darken and the principle shader. So we can now take this value here and let's drag it over and I'll put that into the group input. So this value is going to make all the colors lighter or darker. So if I go out of the node group now, you can see that value is just going to make it brighter or darker. So if I go back into the node group, I'm going to double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to color brightness. Now, I also want to be able to control the amount of ambient occlusion. So this darken here, that's controlling the amount of ambient occlusion. So we can take the factor, we can drag that into the extra socket here. And then if I double click on this to rename it, I'll rename this one to ambient occlusion. And then finally, I want to be able to control the roughness and the bump strength. So let's drag the group input over here and I can take this roughness value. Let's put that to the extra socket. We can make this a bit smaller. And then let's drag this down here. And this first bump strength, that is the bricks bump strength. So I'll put the strength there into the extra socket. And if I double click on this to rename it, I want to rename this one to bricks bump strength. And then this one here, this is controlling the noise. So let's put the strength into the extra socket. And if I double click on this, I'll rename it to noise bump strength. So I'll now click on the group input and I can just like drag it back here. I'll hit the Tab key to go out of the node group and the N key to close the side panel. And there is the finished material. So we can now just review the material. So we have the overall scale. We also have the different colors. So we have colors one and we also have colors two. And then we also have the colors brightness. Then we have the ambient occlusion. You can make this stronger or less strong. We also have the roughness of the material. And then we have the bricks bump strength and the noise bump strength.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaX6OtAMyx4,Procedural Blue Marble Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural blue marble material and integrate it into a custom node group. The tutorial covers adjusting various parameters such as scale, colors, marble distortion, swirl settings, roughness, and clear coat to achieve different aesthetic effects. Additionally, the video includes instructions for setting up the 3D scene, applying the material to objects, and configuring lighting for rendering. Viewers are encouraged to support the creator by purchasing the material or the Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack via links provided in the description.","In this Blender tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural blue marble material. So after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group. So we first have the overall scale, and when you turn the scale up really high, it almost looks like a procedural granite material. So you can do that, or turn the scale much more down. Then we also have the different colors, so we first have color 1, and this will kind of change the other colors of that lighter values and those little swiggles there in the material. And then we also have color 2, and this is basically the main color, so you don't have to have it blue if you don't want to, you can make it really any color. Then we also have this cool marble distortion value, so if you want it less distorted or more distorted, you can change that. And then we also have this cool swirl scale, so I can change the scale of that. We also have the swirl detail, and then we also have the swirl roughness and the swirl distortion. Then we have the roughness of the material, so you can make it very rough or very shiny. And then we also have this clear coat, so this is basically an extra layer of shininess over the material. And then we also have the clear coat roughness.

Alright, so I'll now show you the 3D setup if you want to set up the Blender file the same way that I have. So I press Shift-A, and I went here to Mesh, and I added an icosphere, because icospheres are nice and round, and they have very smooth, even geometry. And then right behind me, if you click on the Add Icosphere Settings, I'm going to turn the subdivisions up to a 6, so that it is very detailed. And then I will just close this, and then using the Object Context menu, I can shade the object smooth. I'm also going to scale the object down, and I'll scale it down by 0.5, so it's half the size. And I can press Control-A, and just apply the scale. Then I'm also going to press Shift-A, and I'll go here and add a monkey head. And I can scale the monkey head much smaller, and kind of bring it over here. And I'm going to also rotate it over to the side, just so we have some cool objects to preview the materials on. I'm also going to press Control-2. Control-2 is going to add a subdivision surface modifier, and then using the Object Context menu, I'll shade the object smooth. And I'll just bring the monkey head kind of right over here. And then I'll also press Control-A, and apply the scale, so this is the object's new default size. Now as far as the rendering engine goes, you can use the Cycles or the Eevee rendering engine. This material works great in both Eevee and Cycles. I'm going to be using Cycles, because I'm going for realism, but you could definitely use Eevee if you want to. So now let's go on to the lighting. So for the lighting, I added these three different area lights right here. So if you press Shift-A, you can go to Light, and you can just add an area light. And then if you click on the area light and go over here to the Object Data Properties, I turn the power of this one to 100. So I scaled this one up pretty big, and I have it kind of pointed down at the object. And then this one over here, I set the shape to Rectangle, and I turn the power to 10. And I kind of just have it here on the side, and this will give us a nice rim light on the edge. And then for this one right over here, I turn the power to 7. And this one again is kind of on the side to give a nice rim light to the edges of the objects. Now I also want to add some nice realistic lighting and reflections. So if you click right over here on the World Properties, I added in this Christmas Photo Studio 04, and I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, and I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI. So once you've downloaded the HDRI, you can just make sure you've added a new world. And then if you click here on the dot next to Color, you can choose Environment Texture. And then just click on the Open button, and you can open up the downloaded HDRI. And then I did also add a camera right here. And if you go up to the Output Properties, I just set the resolution to 1920x1920 so that it is a square image. And also, if you go right over here to the Object Data Properties of the camera, I turned the focal length up to 100, just so it kind of zooms the camera in and makes things look a little bit more flat. And then I will hold down the Z button, and I'll move my mouse up to go into the Rendered mode. So if you want to make the background transparent so that you can't see the HDRI, then we're actually going to go right up here to the Render Properties. And then we're going to scroll down here, and you want to open up the Film tab, and then just checkmark the Transparent button. So the HDRI will still light the scene, but the camera can't see it. And then also to make the colors a little bit nicer, I'm using the View Transform of Filmic here on the Color Management, and I made the look very high contrast. So I'm going to make this panel smaller and bring this panel out. So I am in the Shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I am in the Rendered mode. And then right over here, I have the Shader Editor. So I'm going to click on the object here, and then I will click on New here to add a new material, and I can just rename the material. And then I'm going to click and drag right here, and I'm going to drag this material and drop it onto this object as well, so they both have the same material. And then here is the principled shader. Now I am also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So to enable the Node Wrangler, you can click on Edit, and you can go to the Preferences. And then over there in the Add-ons tab, just search for Node Wrangler, and you can checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So we can now start making the material. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'll go here to the search, and I'm going to start by adding a Voronoi texture. Let's just drop the Voronoi right here. And then using the feature of the Node Wrangler, I can Control-Shift and select the Voronoi texture, and that is going to preview the texture on the object. And then also with the Voronoi texture selected, I'll press Control-T. That is again using the Node Wrangler, and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And I want to plug the object into the vector of the mapping, and the object coordinates will place the procedural texture on the object more evenly. Now let's change the Voronoi scale. So right here, I want to just make the scale 3. Now I want to make this texture look like some little cracks, so I'm going to click on the F1 here, and I'm going to change this to Distance to Edge instead. And now you can see we have those little cracks with the white inside it. Now I want to make this look more organic and natural, so I want to add a texture in here to distort the Voronoi texture. So I'll press Shift-A, and I'll go here to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture, and we're going to drop the noise texture in between the mapping and the Voronoi. So because the noise texture is going through the vector, it's distorting the placement of the Voronoi, and so now it looks all random. And then let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the detail all the way to the max of 15, and also the scale here, I will turn this up to a 12. Now I'm going to click and drag to box select these nodes, and I'm going to bring them over a little bit, because I want to make the noise texture have less of an effect over the Voronoi. So we're going to add a node in here, and then we'll mix it with the noise and the mapping. So I'll press Shift-A, I'll go here to the search, and I'll search for a mix color node, and we'll drop the mix color in between the noise texture and the Voronoi texture. So we can now take the mapping vector, and I'm going to plug that into color A, so this mapping isn't distorted at all, but then this noise texture, this is going to make it distorted. So we want to take the color from this noise texture, and let's put that into color B. So if I now take the factor and drag it back and forth, you can see if it's turned to zero, it's just using the mapping, so it's not distorted at all. However, as I turn the factor up, it's going to use more and more of value B, which is using the noise texture. So we now have the factor which is going to control how much it's distorted. Now I do want to click on the mix here, and I want to change this to the linear light instead, because if it's set to linear light, now it will still distort it, but it won't move the texture around quite as much. So I want to make the distortion pretty subtle, so on the factor here, I'm just going to turn this to like a 0.1. Now I'm going to click and drag the box like these nodes and bring them back a bit, because I want to add a color ramp here to make it more contrasty, so those lines are smaller. So I'll press shift A, and I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and we'll put the color ramp after the Voronoi texture. And then just control shift and select the color ramp to preview it. So I'm going to click on the white tab, and I'm going to drag it over, and you can see as I drag it over to the black tab, it's making those lines very small. So I'm going to drag it really, really close. Then I'm going to hold down the control key and click to add another tab here, and then hold down the control key and click to add another one there. And this tab over here, I'm going to click on the color, and I'm going to make this fully black. And then I want to drag this white tab right over here, and this black tab, I'll also drag this over. So now you can see kind of in the center there, there's a little bit of that noise, and that'll add some cool texture to the material. And also this white tab here, I'm going to drag this over so that those little lines are even more thin. Now I want to make this a bit more patchy because I don't want to be able to see these lines all over the place. I want some areas where those lines aren't visible. So to do that, I'm going to zoom out, and I'll press shift A, and I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's drop the noise texture here, and then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So we're basically going to create a mask, and then we'll mix it in with this other texture to get rid of some of those areas. Now I want to take the vector, and I want to put that into the vector of this noise texture so it's using the object coordinates, just like the other textures. And then here on the detail of this noise, I'm going to turn it all the way up to the max of 15. And then this scale here, I'm going to turn this up to like a 10. Now it's pretty gray right now, and so I want to make it more contrasty. So I can click on this color ramp, I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and I'll drop it here after this noise texture. And then with the color ramp selected, I'm going to hit the backspace, and that is going to reset the color ramp. So I now want to drag these two values together, and if they are closer together, it's going to be more contrasty. So I'm going to drag this tab to about here, and then the white tab I'll drag to about there. And now you can see we have mostly white with little black areas. So I now want to mix these two textures together. So I'll press shift A, and I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for a mix color. Let's drop it right here. And I want to click on the type, and I want to change it to lighten because I just want to add both of the light values. And then let's control shift and select the lighten to preview it. So this top color ramp, I want that to go into the factor because the factor is telling it where it'll be color A on the object and where it'll be color B on the object. Now this color ramp here, this is the one with that little texture with those lines. I'm going to put this one into color A, and I can control shift and select the lighten again. So I'm now going to take color B, and I'm going to turn this up and make it fully white. So now that I've made it fully white, you can see that it's not as visible over here, but you can still see those little lines right over there. Because if I control shift and select this color ramp, you're only going to be able to see the lines from this Voronoi where the black parts are. So right over here, it's white. If I control shift and select the lighten, you can see it's not visible, but then there was a black patch here, and that's where you can see those lines. Now I want to make this entire texture more noisy. So I'll press shift A, and here on the search, I'm going to add another noise texture. We'll drop this down here. And again, let's take the mapping, and I can plug that into the vector of the noise texture. And then I will control shift and select that noise texture preview it. We can change the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 13, also turn the detail all the way to the max of 15. And this distortion, I'm just going to turn it to a small value like a 0.3, so it's a little bit distorted. So now I want to mix this noise into the other textures. But before I do that, I do want to make it a little bit more gray. So I'm going to click on any of these color ramps, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and I'll drop it here after the noise texture. And then with the color ramp selected, I'll hit the backspace just to reset it. Now I first want to click on the white tab, and I'm going to drag it out a bit just so that everything's a bit more light. And then here on this black tab, I want to make it more subtle. So I'll click on the black tab here, and I'm just going to make it kind of like a mid gray color. And the hex value that I'll be using for this gray color is going to be a hex value of 8C, 8C, 8C. So I'm now going to click and drag the box like these nodes, and I'll drag them over. And I want to now mix this texture into this texture here. So I'm going to click on the lighten. I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here, and I'll control shift and select the lighten to preview it. Now I don't want it to be set to lighten. I instead want it to be set to darken, so it adds the dark values. So we'll change this to darken. And then let's take this lighten here, and we'll put that into color A. And then this color ramp here, I will put that into color B. So now if I click on this gray tab here, I can make this lighter or darker, and you can see it's adding the dark values. So it is kind of hard to see, but if you zoom right in there really closely, you can see if this is darker, it's adding those dark values. And then here on the factor, I want to change this to a 0.2, and that way it's a bit more subtle. So I now want to actually create the two different colors. So I could just change the colors with these color ramps, but I instead want to be able to control the colors outside of the node group. So I'm going to click on this darken. I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here. And I can click on the darken, and I'll just change it back to mix, which is the default. And I can drop it here after the darken. So now the darken result is being plugged into the mix, and I actually want the result to be going into the factor. And again, the factor is telling it where it'll be color A and where it'll be color B. So we can now make the two custom colors for A and B. So for this first one right here on color A, I'm going to make this fully white, and then I'm going to make it a very slight blue color. And if you want to use the same exact hex value that I'm using, then right here on the hex, you can type in B4 E6 FF. Now for color B, I want this to be a very dark blue. So I'll click on the color here. I'm going to make this kind of like a blue color like that, and then I'll make it darker. And if you want to use the exact same hex value that I'm using here on color B, you can go to the hex and you can punch in 00234C. So now you can see we have a really cool marble texture. So it is mostly dark, and then there's a few light areas. So we can now take the mix result and we can put that into the base color of the principled shader. So just drag the result into the base color, and then I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now I do want to make it more shiny. So I'm going to go right down here to the clear coat, and I'll turn the clear coat up to 1. And then the clear coat roughness, I'm going to turn this to a 0.1. So this is basically going to add a second layer of roughness. So it adds a very nice shiny surface, and you can see the reflections of those lights, and it really starts to look like marble now. And you can also drag this roughness value up or down, but I actually want to add a texture into this roughness value so that some parts are more rough and other parts are more shiny. So that's what we'll be doing next. So I'll press shift A and I'll go to the search, and I'm going to be adding a noise texture. And I'll also press shift A and I'll go to the search, and I'm also going to add a Voronoi texture. So we'll add noise and a Voronoi, and we're going to mix them both together. So let's take the mapping, and we'll put that into the vector here, the Voronoi, and also the mapping vector, put that into the noise texture. And then I'll drag the Voronoi down here, and I'll put the noise texture on top. So I'll control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And right here on the scale, I just want to turn this up to 70, and I'll leave the other settings how they are. And then I can control shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. And on the Voronoi here, I want to turn the scale up to 55, so it's much smaller. So I now want to mix both of these nodes together. So I'm going to go right up here to this mix here. I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drag it over here, and we'll use this to mix them together. So let's take the Voronoi texture distance, and I'll put that into color A, and then we're going to take the noise texture factor, and I'm going to put that into color B. And I can control shift and select the mix to preview it. And then this factor here, I'm going to turn this all the way up to one. So you can see if it's turned to zero, it's just using the Voronoi, but then as I turn the factor up, it's adding in that noise. And then also let's click on the mix here, and I want to change this again to the linear light, because the linear light does work better. So I can now drag the factor, and you can see how that's distorting it. So I will keep the factor all the way up to one. Now it is very black and white, and it is very strong, and I want to make it more gray and more subtle. So I'll press shift A, then I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and we're going to drop the color ramp right here. Now why I want to use the color ramp to make it more subtle is because the black and white values are going to determine where it'll be more rough and where it'll be more shiny. So let's take the color here, and I can put that into the roughness of the principled shader, and I can control shift and select the principled shader. So right now you can see there's a strong difference in the roughness. So some parts are super rough, and then other parts are super shiny. And that is because of these color ramp colors. So if I make them both more of a gray color, then they're both going to be more subtle, and they're going to be a similar roughness. So this white value, I'm going to make it kind of like just a lighter gray, and then this dark value, I'm going to make it a little bit lighter. And you can play around with these colors to change the amount of roughness, but if you want to use the exact same colors that I'm using, then here on this slightly darker color, I'm using a hex value of six sixes, and then right over here on this gray color here, if you click on the color, this one is going to be six nines. So those are the different hex values that I'm using if you want to use the same colors. So if I now kind of zoom into the material and kind of move around here and kind of see the reflections, there is some subtle difference in the roughness, and so that makes it look a bit more realistic because usually surfaces don't have the exact same roughness, especially for something shiny like this. There might be little bits of dirt or little things which are going to make some parts more rough and other parts more shiny. So it just gives the material a little bit more variation. And then there is one more node that I want to add, and that is that I want to be able to control the roughness value in the custom node group. So I'll press shift A, then I'll go to the search, and I'll search for the hue saturation value, and let's put this after the color ramp. So I now have this value here, and I can turn the value up and down, and because that's making it brighter or darker, that is going to change the roughness. And so we can use this later in the custom node group. So there we have it, there is the procedural material. So I'll now show you how to join this together into a custom node group. So I'm going to click and drag to box select all of the nodes except the material output, and I'll press control G. So control G will join it together into a node group, and if you press the tab key with the node group selected, that is going to go in and out of the node group. So I'll drag the node group right over here, and then I can also drag it out to make it a bit bigger. And then right here on the name, I'm going to rename this to blue marble. So then select the node group, and you can hit tab to go into the node group. I'm going to make this a bit smaller, so we have a bit more space here. And if you press the N key, that is going to open up the side panel, and we have the inputs and the outputs to make the customizable values. So here on the outputs, I'm going to just rename this output to shader just because I like the look of that better. So if we now go right over here to this group input, we can plug values up to the group input, and then we'll be able to control those values outside of the node group. So let's take the mapping here, and we'll take the scale, and I'm going to put this into the group input. Now, because this mapping node is being plugged up to all of the other textures, this scale value will control the size of the entire material. Now, if I go outside of the node group, you can see we have three values, but I just want one single scale value. So I'll go back into the node group, I'll click on the scale here on the inputs, and I want to change the type from vector to float instead, and float will use one single value. Now, here on the default value, we want that to be one, and now you'll be able to see the texture again, although you still can't see it, and that's because we need to go outside of the node group with the tab key, and then here on the scale, I'll turn this to one. So now you can drag this around, and that'll change the overall scale. So let's go back into the node group, and the next values that I want to add are the colors. So I'm going to drag this group input right over here, I'll drag it way over here above this darken, and we can plug up the two custom colors. So I'll plug A here into the extra socket, and also B, plug that into the extra socket. And then if I double click on these to rename them on the inputs, I'm going to rename this to color one, or I can rename this to color two. Now, I also want to be able to control the marble distortion. So if we drag this group input right over here, this linear light here, we can drag the factor, and you can see that is distorting it. So let's take the factor, I can put that right here into the extra socket, and then if I double click on this, I'll rename this one to marble distortion. Now, on this noise texture, we have all these cool values, and so I want to plug these all in. So I'll put the scale here into the extra socket, and also this detail value, and also this roughness, and also this distortion. Now, these are basically going to control the swirls, so if I double click on these, I'm going to add the word swirl to the starting. So we have the swirl scale, we also have the swirl detail, the swirl roughness, and the swirl distortion. So now if I hit tab to go out of the node group, you can see by dragging these values around, it's going to change the swirls there. So now I'll go back into the node group. So now I just want to be able to control the roughness in the clear coat, so let's take this group input, and I can drag it right over here, and we're going to take the hue saturation value, we'll use this value, and we'll plug that into the extra socket. So here on the value, I can click on this and just rename it to roughness, and then here at the very end, I do want to be able to control the clear coat, so let's plug the clear coat right here, and also the clear coat roughness, let's plug that in there. So I can now drag the group input right back here, I'll hit the tab key to go outside of the node group, I'll hit the N key just to close that side panel, and here is the finished procedural material, with the customizable values. So we can just now review the material. So we have the overall scale, and it actually looks really cool if you make it very small, or you can keep it kind of big. Then we also have the different colors, so color one, and we also have color two. Then we have this cool marble distortion, we also have some different swirl settings, so the scale, and the detail, and the roughness, and also the distortion. Then we have the roughness of the material, we also have this cool clear coat value, and then the clear coat roughness. So that is it, that is how to create this procedural blue marble material.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttcBJ-A8e3s,Procedural Sci-Fi Greeble Material (Blender Tutorial),"This Blender tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural sci-fi greeble material suitable for various sci-fi objects like spaceships or space stations. The tutorial covers creating the procedural material, combining it into a custom node group, and adjusting parameters like overall scale, custom colors, noise scale, line amount, greeble scale, and roughness. Additionally, the video provides scene setup instructions, including adding objects, lighting, and HDRI to enhance realism. The creator offers the material for purchase on their Gumroad and Patreon, alongside other procedural material packs, and encourages viewers to explore their YouTube playlist for more tutorials.","In this blender tutorial I'll show you how to create this procedural sci-fi greeble material. So this material could be used for like something on a spaceship it could also be used as like a sci-fi wall in a corridor or in a space station or some other spaceship or space station or some kind of sci-fi object like a sci-fi box. And after we create the procedural material I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the material and then we also have some custom colors so we have colors 1, 2, and 3. Then we just have the noise scale to change the size of the noise on the metal and then we also have the lines amount so if you want more lines or less lines you can change that. We also have the greeble scale so this will just change the size of the sci-fi greebles. And then we also have the greeble randomness and this is basically just like a seed value. Then we also have the roughness of the metal and then we also have the greeble bump strength we also have the lines bump strength and then finally the noise bump strength.

So I'll now show you my scene setup if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I pressed shift A and I just went right down here and add an icosphere and then I pressed ctrl 2 and that gives the icosphere a subdivision surface modifier and then using the object context menu I'll shade the object smooth and then I'll move the sphere over. I'm also gonna press shift A and I'm gonna add this to a cube because I think it looks kind of cool on a cube. I'll scale the cube down a little bit and I'll move it right over here maybe scale down a little bit more and I can rotate the cube. I'll rotate it on the z-axis and move it over and then I can press ctrl A and apply the scale so that's the new scale. Then I can hit the tab key to go into edit mode and with everything selected I'll press ctrl B to add a bevel and I will scroll my mouse wheel out until there are a few cuts and then I can just left click again to place the bevel and then I can tab to go back to object mode and then shade it smooth with the object context menu. Then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera at the objects. Now for the lighting I added these three different area lights right here. So you can press shift A you can go down here to light and add the area light and then if you select one of the area lights and click over here to go to the object data properties you can change the shape to rectangle and change the shape. So this first area light right here this one I set the power to 300 and I stretched it out on the x-axis here and I rotated it sideways so that it's lighting up this side of the object. And then I did the same thing for this over here and then also this one over here so I just duplicated those three times. Now also if you go over here to the world properties to get some nice realistic lighting and I added in the Skylit Garage HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com the link will be in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1k HDR version. So once you download the HDRI you can add a new world you can click on the yellow dot next to color and you can choose environment texture and then just click on the open button and add in the HDRI. Now let's also do a few other scene settings so if you click over here on the render properties I'm gonna be using the cycles rendering engine however you could also use Eevee. Eevee will work great for this material as well. Now if you open up the film tab right here I'm gonna be checkmarking the transparent and that way you can't see the HDRI in the background but it'll still light the scene. And then also if you open up the color management right here I'm gonna use the view transform of filmic and the look to very high contrast to pop out the colors and make everything more contrasty. So you can press the zero on the numpad to go into the camera view you can hold down the Z button and move your mouse up into the rendered mode. I'm gonna make this smaller over here and then let's make this smaller. So I am right over here on the shading workspace so I have the 3d viewport right here and the shader nodes right here. So I'm just gonna select the object here and let's click on new and I can just rename the material. And then I can click and drag and I can drop this material onto this other object as well. And then I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes so if you don't have the Node Wrangler add-on enabled you can click on edit and go to the preferences and then over there on the add-ons tab just search for Node Wrangler and you can check mark the Node Wrangler add-on. So I'll show you how to use it in the video. So what I'm first gonna do is create those little stripes which are going up and down. So I'll press shift a I'll go to the search and I'm gonna search for the gradient texture. Let's just drop it right here and I can ctrl shift and select the gradient texture and that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler. So by ctrl shift and selecting different nodes that is gonna preview the node on the object. And then also with the gradient texture selected I'll press ctrl T that is gonna add the texture coordinate and mapping and I want to plug the object up to the vector of the mapping because the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. Now I'm gonna click on this linear here and I'm gonna change it to radial instead. So now if I go up here to the top you can see it starts out as black and then it goes around and it gets more and more white. However I want to have many little stripes so I'm gonna press shift a I'm gonna go to the search and I'm gonna search for the math node and let's put the math node after the gradient texture. And then we can just put the color into the top value. Now I want to click on the type here and I'm gonna change it to multiply instead. And then I also want to drag these nodes out of the way and I'm gonna select the multiply the math node I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here after this one. And in this one I'm gonna click on the type here and under the rounding I'll change it to ping-pong. And then right here on the scale on the ping-pong I'll just turn that up to 1. Now right here on this multiply I can turn the value up and that is gonna add more and more of those stripes. So basically if I select the multiply node I can press the M key to mute it so that it hides it. So the ping-pong is basically going to make it so that it turns to black and then turns to white again and then the multiply is going to add more and more of those stripes. So here on the value I'm gonna turn this to 15 on the multiply so that there are a few different stripes. Now these stripes are a bit boring and I want to have a few smaller stripes next to the larger stripes. So to add more detail to this I'll press shift A. I'll go to the search and I'm gonna search for a color ramp and let's put the color up here after the ping-pong. And then I can drag these nodes back and I want to click on the color ramp and I want to drag it out and make it much longer and if it's longer then we'll be able to work with it more detail. So I'm first gonna click on the black tab and I'm gonna drag the black tab way over here and then I'm gonna drag the white tab over here. Then what I can do is hold down the ctrl key and click right here to add another tab and I'll drag this one over so now we have a black tab then a white tab and then a black tab and you can see what it's doing. So I can now hold down the ctrl key and click again to add another tab and if I click here on the color this one I want to make fully white and I'm gonna drag this one over here so now we have a black tab then a white tab then another black and then a white one. And I can kind of drag these together and play around with this and so now we have a bit more detail in those stripes. Now I also want to do a pretty similar thing but it's gonna be over here so I'm gonna hold down the ctrl key and click right here to add another tab and I will drag this one kind of to about here then I will hold down the ctrl key and click again to add another tab and drag this one to about here. And then right in between here I want to hold down the ctrl key again and click to add another tab. So now we have three tabs here and then I want to add two more in the middle which are white. So I'll hold down the ctrl key click here and then click here so now we have five of them so then this one if I click here I'll make this fully white and also if I click here on this one I'm gonna make this one fully white as well. So we're gonna have black then white then black and then white and then black again. And if I drag these around we can change the size of it and we can change the contrast. Now as well as that texture I also want to create some sci-fi greeble. So I'll press shift a I'll go to the search and I'm gonna search for the Voronoi texture and let's drop the Voronoi under the gradient. And then I want to take the mapping vector and I'll put that into the vector of the Voronoi because I want it to use the object coordinates and I also want the mapping node to be plugged up to all the textures. And then let's ctrl shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it. Now I'm gonna click on the 3d here and I'll change it to 4d and this will make it more random and it'll give it more 3d depth. Let's also click on the f1 here and I'll change it to f2 instead. And then I also want to click on this bottom one here we're gonna change this to the Chebyshev. So you can see the Chebyshev looks like these little squares and we can use that to create the greeble. Now I want to make this more contrasty because it's pretty gray. So I'll press shift a I'll go to the search and I'll search for another color ramp and let's drop this after the Voronoi texture. And I can just drag it over here. So now I want to use this color ramp to make it more contrasty as well. So I'm first gonna click and drag to bring out this tab here and this black one I'm gonna drag this one out here and I'll drag the white one a bit closer something like that. Then I'm gonna hold down the ctrl key and click here to add another tab and I'll drag this one over so it has a bit more contrast. And then I'm also gonna hold down the ctrl key and click here to add another one. And this one I want to make sure this is fully white and I want to drag this one kind of to about here. And then to give it more contrast I can hold down the ctrl key and click there to add another black one. And then this one I'm gonna drag over here. So you can see because we're switching it from black to white and black to white it's giving us some really cool details and it's giving a very cool effect. Now you can see there are still many areas where it's kind of gray and smooth. So I'm gonna click on the linear here and I'm gonna change it to constant instead. So this way it's gonna be very sharp and you can see now that looks really cool and it looks like some sci-fi greeble or some details on like the side of a spaceship. Although I do want to change the scale a bit so let's go back here to this voronoi texture and here on the scale I'm gonna turn this up and I think a scale value of 8 looks a bit better. Alright so that is looking really cool so we now have these cool lines here and also the greeble. So I now want to mix them together. So I'm gonna click and drag to box select these nodes and I'm gonna drag them back so I have a bit more space. And one more thing before I mix these two together I do want to create the gray metal colors after this color ramp. So I'll press shift A, I'll go to the search and I'll search for the mix color and let's drop the mix color right here. So we're gonna drop it after this color ramp so the color is gonna go into the factor and the factor is determining where it'll be color A and where it'll be color B. So here on color A I'm gonna make this kind of like a dark gray color and then here in color B this is also gonna be a bit darker but it'll be a little bit lighter. And if you want to use the same hex values that I'm using for color A the hex value is gonna be 404040 and then here on color B this hex value color is gonna be 8C8C8C. And why I'm adding the mix node after the color ramp instead of just changing the color ramp colors is because I want to be able to control these colors outside of the node group so we can do that with the mix node. So I now want to mix this other color ramp into the color. So I'll click on the mix I'll press shift D to duplicate it and let's drop it here after this one and then if I click on the mix type right here I want to change it to darken so it just adds the dark values. So I can now put the mix result into color A and then we can take this color ramp color and let's put that into the factor. So now it's gonna add all the dark values. So if I now click here on color B you can just drag this down to make it a bit darker and make sure you ctrl shift and select the darken to preview it. So by making it darker we're now gonna be able to see those lines showing up. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using here on color B you can go to the hex and you can punch in 595959. Now I also want to mix in a little bit of noise so let's create some noise up here. So I'll press shift A I'll go to the search and I'll search for a noise texture. Let's drop this here and then again the mapping vector can go into the vector the noise texture and I can ctrl shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And then I want to change some of the settings so I'll turn the detail to the max of 15 and also turn the roughness to a 0.9 so it's much more rough. And you can see it has lots of detail now. Now I want to make it a bit darker and more contrasty so I'll press shift A I'll go to the search and I'll search for another color ramp and let's put the color ramp after the noise texture. And then I can drag the black tab over to about here and I can also drag the white tab over to make it more contrasty. So now we have some nice noise and we're going to add that into the metal. So what we can do is click on this darken we can press shift D to duplicate it and drop it right here and then we can mix this up with the noise. So let's take this darken result and let's put that into color A and we're going to leave the mix type set to darken and then we can take color B and we're just going to make that fully black. So we can now take this color ramp color right here and we're going to put that into the factor so again the factor will tell it where it's going to be color A and color B. So now I can control shift and select the darken and you can see it's just adding those darkest values of the noise. So if I zoom in closely now you can see it looks like the metal is a bit more rusty maybe a little bit worn and dirty. So I can take the result and let's now put that into the base color and I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now if you want to make it look more like metal you can turn the metallic value up however I actually want to make it look kind of like it's a gray painted metal and paint actually isn't a metallic value just metal is a metallic value. So if you want to make it look very metallic you could turn the metallic up I'm actually going to turn the metallic down to zero just because I think that looks a bit better. And then also I want to make it very rough so here on the roughness I'm going to turn this up to like a 0.65 so it's a bit more rough. So I now want to add some values into the normal to give it some bump because right now it really doesn't have any bump and it looks very flat. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to go to the search and I'll search for this bump node and I'll drop it down here and we can use the bump node to convert the black and white data into normal data that the bump can use. So let's take the bump and we'll put that normal into the normal of the principled shader and now we can add in some values to make it bumpy. So I first want to take this color ramp color let's take the color and put that into the height value and that way it's going to convert the color ramp or this noise texture into normal data. So you can now see it looks very bumpy and rough. However that is a bit too strong so I'm just going to turn the strength to a 0.2 so it is a lot more subtle. Then I also want to add in this darken here so I'll click on the bump node I'll press shift E to duplicate it and I'll drop it down here so the normal can go into the normal and that way we can mix multiple bump masks together. So I can now take this darken result and I'm going to put that into the height value and then this one I want to be much stronger so I'll turn the strength all the way up to 1. So now you can see that those lines look very bumpy. I can also box select some of these nodes and bring them over just so that the wires aren't stretched quite as much. Now as well as that I do want to make these little sci-fi greeble bits look like they're popping out as well. So to do that I want to make a few different variations of this Voronoi. So I'm going to click on this color ramp and I'll press ctrl shift D so ctrl shift D will duplicate the node but keep the wire plugged up and then with this color ramp selected I'll hit the backspace and that is going to reset it and I can ctrl shift and select the color ramp to preview it. So to make it more contrasty I'll drag the white tab over here and then I'll drag the black tab over and I'll drag this over to about here. So you can see we now have some little sci-fi greeble bits but you can see here on the edges there is that little gray value and so that'll make it look like it's coming up because it'll be white then it will come up and then be black so that'll make it look like there's some little parts of the metal which are popping out. I'm also going to click on this color ramp and I'll press ctrl shift D to duplicate the node but keep the wire plugged up and I'll ctrl shift and select the color ramp to preview it and this one I'm gonna drag the black tab over here and then I'll also drag the white tab right over here so it's very contrasty. Maybe drag the black tab back a little bit. So now if I ctrl shift and select these we have two different layers of greeble so I'm gonna mix those into the bumps as well. So I'll click on the bump node I'll press shift D to duplicate it drop it here and I can put the normal into the normal and then this first color ramp here I can put that into the height value to convert it to normal data and I'll ctrl shift and select the principled shader to preview it. So now if I kind of zoom in here zoom into these areas you can see it looks like it's slanting down and then going back. However I want to click on this invert here because I want to look like it's slanting up instead. So now we have some little parts on the greeble and the metal which are popping out. I'm also gonna click on this bump node I'll press shift D to duplicate it drop it here and then I can take this color ramp color we'll put that into the height value and then this bump here we can put the normal into the normal and that's gonna make these other areas pop out. So you can see it is taking effect right here and if you zoom in here if you want to drag this around you can drag this and you can drag this so just drag the tabs around to make it where you want to be popping out. So I think something like that is pretty good. And there we go so there is the finished material. So I'm now going to show you how to join the material together into a custom node group. So I'm gonna click and drag to box select all these nodes except the material output and I'll press ctrl G to join it into a node group. I'll press the N key to open up the side panel and if you go to group there's going to be inputs and outputs and here in the outputs I'm just gonna double click on this and I'll rename it to shader because I like that better. So then we can go right over here to this group input and we can add up all the custom values. So I first want to change the overall scale so this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures. So I'm gonna put the scale into the group input right there and I can drag the group input down here and then this mapping node had three different values. So if I click on the scale right here I want to click on the type right here and instead of it being vector I want it to be float and that way is just one single value. And then right here on the default value I want to turn this to one but you can see it's still disappeared. So if I hit the tab key that is gonna go in and out of the node group and you can see here is the custom value that we made so this is the scale so I just need to turn it back to one. And then also you can see we haven't renamed the node group so I can click here on the sci-fi greeble I'll press ctrl C to copy the name click here on the node group and press ctrl V to paste the name. So now it's called sci-fi greeble and I can drag the custom node group right over here. So then with the custom node group selected you can hit the tab key to go in and out of the node group. So now let's take the group input and I'm gonna drag it right over here and I'll drag it above these mix nodes so that we can add the different colors. So let's take color A on the mix I'll put that into the extra socket I'll take color B put that into the extra socket and then this one right here let's put B into the extra socket. So then I can double click right up here to rename these and I'm gonna rename these to color 1, color 2, and then also right here I'll rename this one to color 3. So if you hit the tab key to go out of the node group we have three different custom colors. So let's go back into the node group. Now I also want to change the noise scale so let's drag the group input right back here and we have the scale value on the noise so I'll put the scale into the extra socket here and then if I double click on this to rename it I'll rename it to noise scale. And then I want to also change the amount of lines. So this multiply value right here we have the scale value and this will change the lines amount. So let's put the value into the extra socket here and then if I double click on this I can rename it to lines amount. And then I also want to be able to control the greeble scale so let's drag the group input right down here and we have this scale value on the Voronoi texture. So let's put the scale right in there and then I can double click on this to rename it and I'll rename this one to greeble scale. And then I also want to be able to control the greeble randomness so basically a seed value. So we have the W value here and that'll make it more random. So let's put the W value here into the extra socket and then if I double click on this to rename it I'm gonna rename this one to greeble randomness. And then I also want to be able to control the roughness of the material and also the metallic so let's drag the group input right over here. So if you want to control the metallic value you can just take the metallic put that right in there and then you can make it more metal if you want to. We also have this roughness value here so if you want to be able to control this you can just put the roughness into the extra socket here and it's already called roughness. So I'm now going to drag the group input right down here and I want to plug up all the bump strings. So the first one that I want to control is the greeble bump strength and both of these two first bump nodes those are controlling the greeble bump strength. So I'll put the strength into the extra socket here and then I'll take this bump node strength and I'll put this one into the same socket so they're both going into the strength. Then I can double click on this to rename this and I'll rename this one to greeble bump strength. So because they're going into the same socket this value will control both of the bump strings. Then we have this bump strength right here and this one is going to control the lines. So let's take the strength from this bump and we'll put that into the extra socket and then this one I'm going to rename to lines bump strength. And then finally I want to be able to control the noise bump strength and that is this one here. So I can turn this up and down. So let's put the strength into the extra socket here and then I can double click on this to rename it and I'm going to rename this one to noise bump strength. So I'll press the N key to close the side panel. I'll click on the group input and I'll drag it right over here underneath the texture coordinate. And I can hit the tab key to go outside of the node group. And I'll press ctrl s again to save the file. So there we have it. So there is the finished procedural material. So let's just review the material. So we have the overall scale. We also have all the different colors. So we have color 1 and we also have color 2 and we also have color 3. And then we also just have the noise scale. We also have the amount of lines. We also have the greeble scale and the greeble randomness. So this is basically a seed value. And we also have the metallic value if we want it to be more metal. And then we also have the roughness if we want it to be more shiny. Then we have the greeble bump strength, the lines bump strength, and then finally the noise bump strength. So thank you so much for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51Z29Gph6QI,Procedural Obsidian Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to build a procedural obsidian material in Blender, including steps to customize it using a custom node group. This involves adjusting parameters such as the material's color, chunk size, wave and noise scales, bump strengths, and displacement. The tutorial emphasizes using the Cycles rendering engine for displacement features and explains setting up a scene with appropriate lighting and using HDRI for realistic reflections. The video also promotes the creator's Gumroad store, Patreon page, and additional material packs, along with a tutorial playlist for further learning.","In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural obsidian material in Blender. And then after I show you how to create the procedural material, we'll be joining the material together into this custom node group so you can customize the material. So we have the overall size of the entire material, and then we also have the color here so you can keep it black if you want to, or if you wanted to, you could make it like a very dark blue or a very dark purple. Then we have the chunky scale, and this is going to change the size of the obsidian chunks, and then we also have the wave scale, we also have the noise scale, and then also this noise distortion, and this will really change the look of the material. We also have the roughness of the material, we also have the wave bump strength, and also the noise bump strength, and then we also have the noise displacement, so if you turn this up, it's going to be a bit more noisy and look a bit more cracked and kind of beat up, or if you turn this down, it's just going to have all the little chunks. And then finally we have the displacement strength. If you'd like to help support me and this channel and purchase the material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description. And I've also finished creating another 10 procedural materials, so I've just released Blender Procedural Material Pack number 15. You can check out that material pack with the links in the description. And I've also updated my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack with all of my new procedural materials, and all of my existing customers can re-download the product files to get the new update with the new materials. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. Alright so real quick I'll show you how I have my scene set up if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I pressed shift A, I went here to mesh, and I added an icosphere. And then after I add the icosphere, right behind me, if you click on the arrow to open up the add icosphere settings, I turn this up to 6 because I want it to be very detailed. And why I'm making it very detailed is because the material will use the displacements, and so the displacements need lots of geometry to make the mesh actually pop out. And then I can shade this object smooth. Then I can scale the object down, and I'll scale it down to like a .2, because the default objects in Blender are pretty large, they're a bit larger than an average human. And then I will press control A, and I will apply the scale so that this is now the object's new default size. Now I did mention that we're going to be using displacements, so if you want to use the displacements, then right up here on the render properties, you will need to be using the cycles rendering engine if you want to use the displacements, because material displacements are not supported in Blender Eevee. You can, however, follow along with this tutorial in Blender Eevee, but just know that the displacements will not work in Eevee. So if you want to do this in Eevee, then instead of using a sphere, you could model some other rock object, and then add the material to that object. Now because we're using the displacements, I do want lots of geometry. So also on this object, if you go over here to the modifier properties, I added the subdivision surface modifier, and I turned the levels viewport and render just up to 1, and so this will subdivide the mesh and give it even more geometry for the displacements to use. Now for the lighting, I started off adding these three lights right here. So these are area lights, so if you press shift A and go down to light, you can add an area light, and on these area lights, I turned the power up to 20, and I made them a slight blue color, and I also turned the shape to rectangle and made them kind of long. And I have one on this side, one on the top, and then one over on this side. And this will give some nice rim lights and reflections to the material. And then I also added another area light right up here, and this area light, I turned the shape to disc, so that it's circular, and I turned the power up to 40, so that it is nice and bright, to add some nice bright lighting on top of the object. And then to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections over here on the world properties, I added in the photo studio Broadway hall, and I downloaded the 1K HDR version, and this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, so I'll have a link in the video description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. So once you download the HDRI, you can add a new world in the blender, and you can click on the yellow dot next to color, and you can choose environment texture, and then just click on the open button and open up the HDRI. Now if I hold down the Z button and go up into the rendered mode, you can see the background is transparent, and I did that just to make the background less distracting, so you can't see it. So if you click here on the render properties, and then scroll down, you can open up the film tab here, and you can checkmark the transparent button, so the background is transparent. And also if you go down here to the color management, I'm using the view transform of filmic, and the look to very high contrast to make the colors look nicer. And then I also added a camera, so if you press shift A, you can go down here and add a camera, and then I pointed the camera just at the object. And then if you click right over here on the object data properties with the camera selected, I turned the focal length to 80 just to zoom the camera in a bit. Now also if you go up here to the output properties, I turned the resolution to 1920 by 1920, and that way it is a square image. So you can now click right up here to go to the shading workspace, and I'll hold down the Z button and move my mouse up into the rendered mode. So in the shading workspace, I have the 3D viewport right over here, and the shader editor here. So I'm going to click on the object, and I'll click on new to add a new material. Now to make sure the displacements will work on the material, again you need to make sure you're using the cycles rendering engine if you want to use the displacements. And then once you add the new material, you can click here on the material properties, and you can scroll down here to the settings, and you can go to surface. So we want to set the displacement here to displacement and bump, and this is telling the material that it can use the displacements. And then I also will be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on edit and go to the preferences, and then over there on the add-ons tab, just search for Node Wrangler, and you can check mark the Node Wrangler add-on. So to start off, let's take the base color here, and I'm going to make it fully black. If you wanted to, you could make it a very dark purple or a very dark blue, but I'm going to make it fully black. And then I want to turn the roughness down to make it more shiny, so I'll turn the roughness to like a .16. So I now want to add the texture, which is going to be put into the normal to give it some bump on the surface of the material. So I'll press shift-A, and I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for the wave texture, and let's drop the wave texture here. And then I will control-shift and select the wave texture to preview it, and if you control-shift and select different nodes, that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler, and it'll allow you to preview the different nodes. So with the wave texture selected, I'll press control-T, and that will add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes, and I want to use the object coordinates, so let's put the object into the vector. So I now want to change some of the wave texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 22, and then I also want to distort it quite a lot, so I'm going to distort it to 130. Then I also want there to be a lot of detail, so I'll turn the detail to the max of 15. And then I do actually want to turn the detail scale down a bit so that it's a bit smaller, so I'll turn the detail scale to a 0.3, and I'll leave these other values at the default. Now I want to make this texture look a bit more distorted and random, and make it look more like Obsidian. So I'll press shift-A, and I'll go to the search, and I'll search for a noise texture, and I'm going to put the noise texture in between the mapping and the wave. And so because this noise texture is going through the vector, it's distorting the placement of the wave texture. And I want to make sure the color is going into the vector of the wave texture. So now let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I'll turn the scale to 6, I also want to leave the detail at 2 because I don't want it to be too detailed, and then I also want to turn the roughness down so that it is a bit more distorted. And then this distortion here, I will turn up to a 0.7 so it's a bit more distorted. So you can see how random that is. So I now want to take this wave texture color, and I want to put it into the normal to give the material some bump, and then I will control-shift and select the principled shader. Now you can see it's not working properly, that's because we need to convert the color data into normal data. So I'll press shift-A and I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for a bump node, and let's put the bump node between the wave texture and the normal. So just stick it right there, and then I want the wave texture color to be going into the height value of the bump. So now you can see it looks very bumpy. Now that is way too strong, so I'm going to turn the strength down to like a 0.07 so that it is much less strong. But now you can see we have those little waves over the surface. Now we do want to make the waves look a bit more flat, so I'm going to zoom way in here so you can see it really close up. And I'll press shift-A and I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and we'll put the color ramp between the wave texture and the bump. So just stick it right there. So now if I drag this white tab over, you can see it is kind of flattening the waves. It's kind of flattening the top of those waves. So I'll just drag the white tab kind of to about here, so it is a bit more flat and that looks a bit better. Now I also want to give this material some overall noise in the surface bump, so I'm going to click on this noise texture, and I'll press control-shift-D. So control-shift-D is going to duplicate the node, but it'll keep the wire plugged up. And I can also maybe box select these and bring them down. And I will control-shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So now let's change some of the settings. So this one I want to turn the scale up to 15, and I also want it to be very detailed, so I'll turn the detail to the max of 15. And also this roughness here, I will turn back to the default of 0.5. And I will leave the distortion at 0.7. So now this is very detailed, and so we can plug it up to the normal to give some noisy bump. So I'm going to select this bump node, and I'll press shift-D to duplicate it, and I'm going to drop it here after the first one. So the normal can go through the normal, so we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So let's take the noise texture factor, and I'm going to put that into the height of the bump. So now if I control-shift and select the bump, you can see what it's doing. If I zoom in there, you can see there's a bit of noise. However, I do want it to be very subtle, so let's turn the strength to a 0.03 on this second bump. So I can now control-shift and select the principled shader to preview it, and I will zoom out to see that material. So this is looking a bit like Obsidian, but it is very smooth and round. So I want to make it kind of bumpy and chunky. So I'll press shift-A, I'll go to the search, and I'll search for the Voronoi texture, and let's put the Voronoi texture under this noise. And then I want to take the mapping vector, and let's put that under the vector, because I want it to be using the object coordinates. And I can control-shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it. So you can see the Voronoi texture is white, and then it goes down and has these black dots. I want to see more of the dots though, so I'm going to turn the scale up to 11. So if you look around on the Voronoi texture, you can see there are some little white areas, kind of some little white lines, and then inside the white lines are these little black areas. So if we put this Voronoi into the displacement, that'll make the white areas pop out more, and then the parts that are darker, that is going to be going back in more. So let's take the distance, I'm going to pull out a wire, and I'm going to put this into the displacement of the material output. And then I can control-shift and select the principled shader. Now if the displacements are not working, then you need to click right here on the render properties, and you need to make sure you're using the Cycles rendering engine, because Eevee doesn't support material displacements. And also, if you go down here to the material properties, make sure to open up the settings, and under the surface, you want to make sure that the displacement is using displacement and bump, and this is telling the material that it can use the displacements. Now you can see it's not really working properly, it's just jutting off to the side, and that's because I need to convert this black and white data into displacement data. So I'll press shift-A, I'll go to the search, and I'll search for the displacement node, and I want to put it in between the Voronoi and the displacement. So just drop it here, and then I can drag it down here under the shader. Now to actually convert this to displacement data, we want the distance to be going into the height value. So the distance of the Voronoi can go into the displacement height. So now you can see it is actually popping out the mesh, although it is way too strong, so I'm going to turn the scale way down to a .07, so it is much more subtle. But now you can see those white areas are popping out, and so now we have these sharp, chunky areas. That is looking pretty cool, but I do also want to mix this with some noise. So I'll press shift-A, I'm going to go to the search, and I'll search for the mix color, and let's put the mix color before the displacement. Now I want the Voronoi texture distance to be going into color A, but then I want to take this noise texture color, and I'm going to put that into color B. So this mix node here is mixing the noise and the Voronoi together. Now if I drag the factor around, you can see it's going to be only the Voronoi, or only the noise. But instead of just dragging them around, I want to click on the mix here, and I want to change it to darken. So by changing it to darken, it's going to add the dark values. So now if I turn the factor to zero, it's just using the Voronoi, but then as I drag the factor up, it's adding the dark values, so the Voronoi is still there, but I can add more and more of that noise. Now I don't want to add very much noise, so I'm going to turn the factor to a .3, and that way, now there is a bit of noise, you can kind of see right there, there's a bit of noise there, and some over here, but most of the material is that chunky Voronoi texture. And that is it, so that is the procedural obsidian material. So I'm now going to show you how to join this material into a custom node group, so you can control the values. So I'm going to click and drag to box select all of these nodes except the material output, and then with these nodes selected, I can press Ctrl G, and Ctrl G will join the nodes into a node group. I'm going to press the N key to open the side panel, and then we have inputs and outputs. And here on the outputs, I'm going to double click on the BSDF, because I just want to rename it to shader, because I like that better. So then I can hit the Tab key to go outside of the node group, and then I can click on the node group, and I can drag it over here next to the material output. I'm also going to drag this out to make it a bit bigger, and then also here I can call it obsidian, so I'll copy the name. I'll click here on the node group and paste it with Ctrl V, just paste the name, so it is called obsidian. So if you select the node group, you can hit the Tab key, and that'll go in and out of the node group. So now we can add up all the custom values here into the inputs and the outputs. So let's go over here to the starting of the material, and we have this group input. So let's drag this down here, so we can plug values up to the group input to control it outside of the node group. So I first want to be able to control the overall scale, and this mapping node is plugged up to all the textures. So this mapping scale will control the entire size of the material. So let's put the scale into the group input, and then I want to click on the input here, and I want to click on the type, and I want to change it to float instead, so it is one single value instead of the three values. Now right here on the default value, I want to turn this back to one, because that's the default, and then if I Tab to go out of the node group, I want to turn the scale just back to one, because that's the default. So I can now Tab to go back into the node group. And the next value that I want to add is the color, so I'll click on the group input, and I'm going to drag this over here, and then let's take the base color, and I can put that into the extra socket here, and then you can leave this at base color, but I'm going to double click on this, and I'm going to just rename it to color. Now I also want to be able to control the scale of the chunks, so let's drag the group input right back here, and this Voronoi texture, this scale value is going to control the size of those chunks. So let's put the scale into the extra socket here, and then I'll double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename this to chunky scale. Now I also want to be able to control the wave scale, so that is going to be those little waves there on the surface, so we can take this wave texture scale, and let's put that into the extra socket, and then I can double click on this, and I'll rename it to wave scale. Then I also want to be able to control the noise scale, so this noise texture here, you can see if I drag the scale, that is changing the noise, so let's put the scale here into the extra socket, and I can double click on this to rename it, and I'll rename it to noise scale. Now I also want to be able to control this distortion value here on the noise, because this distortion really can change the look of the material. So I'll take the distortion, I'll put that into the extra socket, and then if I double click on this to rename it, I'm going to rename it to noise distortion. Then I also want to be able to control the roughness of the material, so let's drag the group input right over here, and we can put the roughness into the extra socket, and it's already named roughness. Then I want to control the two bump strengths, so I'll drag the group input down here behind the bumps, and this first one, this is going to change the wave bump strength, so let's put the strength there into the extra socket, and then I can click on this, and I'll rename it to wave bump strength. Then we also have this second bump here, and this is changing the noise bump strength. So we'll put the strength value into the extra socket here, and I can rename this one to noise bump strength. Then I want to be able to control the amount of noise in the displacement. So if I drag the group input right down here, we have this factor value, and that'll add more noise, or get rid of the noise. So let's put the factor into the extra socket here, and then I can double click on this to rename it, and I'm going to rename this to noise displacement. And then finally, I want to control the displacement strength, so let's put the displacement scale into the extra socket here, and I'm going to rename this to displacement strength. So I can now drag the group input right back here behind the texture coordinate, press the tab key to go outside of the node group, and I'll press the N key to close the side panel. And so there is the finished procedural material, and we now have all the different custom values that we can control, like the overall scale, you can also change the color, you can also change the chunky scale and the wave scale, also the noise scale and the distortion, you can also change the roughness, and then you have some different bump strengths, and then finally you have the noise displacement and the displacement strength.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKyaRgInXZM,Procedural Cloud Material ☁️ (Blender Tutorial),"In the tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural cloud material in Blender, detailing how to customize various aspects like cloud scale, color, noise scale, visibility, sharpness, edge noise, detail, distortion, smoothness, and density. The tutorial includes tips on setting up the Blender scene for the best results, recommending the Cycles rendering engine for realism. The video also explains how to group these nodes into a custom node group for easier manipulation. Additionally, the creator mentions that the material can be purchased on their Gumroad and Patreon pages, and they offer an Ultimate Procedural Material Pack with all their materials.","In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural cloud material in Blender. And after we create the procedural cloud material, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group so you can customize the clouds. So we have the cloud scale, so if you want to make the cloud bigger you can, or you can make the cloud smaller. Then we also have the cloud color, so if you want to make this like a dark rain cloud, you could turn this down to a gray color, or you could make it a very white puffy cloud. Or if you're trying to create some sort of abstract smoke material, then you could change the color. Then we have the noise scale, so I can turn this down and there's lots more noise in the clouds, or I can turn this up. There's also the clouds visibility, so if I want the clouds to be very wispy and be able to see through the clouds, I can turn the visibility way down, or I can turn this up if I want the clouds to be much thicker. Then we also have the sharpness of the clouds, so I can turn this down, you can see they're much more thin, or I can turn this way up and you can see the clouds look very thick. Then we have this edge noise, and if I turn this down the edges of the clouds will be much more smooth, or I can turn this way up and there's going to be much more noise on the edges of the clouds. Then we also have this detail amount, so if I want there to be less detail I can just turn this down so it's not quite as detailed. Then we also have two distortion values, so you can see here's the first distortion value, there's lots of little distortion, and then there's also this second distortion value, and this is going to affect more of the inside of the cloud, and then also distortion one is going to kind of distort the edges a bit more. And also if you want the clouds to be a bit more puffy, you could turn the distortion down, you can see that cloud is much more puffy, or you can turn the distortion up if you want the clouds to be much more wispy. And then we have two smoothness values, so I can make the edges of the clouds much smoother, or I can make it less smooth, and the second smoothness value as well. And then finally we have the density of the clouds, so I can make the cloud very thick if I wanted to, or if I want this cloud to be very thin, I could turn this way down, and you can see through the cloud and it's not very dense. Now as well as having all these controls for the clouds, you can also control the shape of the cloud using the object. So I just have a cube object here, but if I just go up into the rendered view, I can go into edit mode, and I can extrude some of the faces out of the cloud, maybe scale this down a bit, and I could select some of the faces here, maybe extrude this out, and so you can see as I'm changing the shape of this object, it's going to change the shape of the cloud. Now you can use this material in the Eevee rendering engine if you want to, you can see here is the material in Eevee, but I'm going to be using Cycles because I do think it looks much better in the Cycles rendering engine, and also I'm going for realism, and Cycles is more realistic. And if you'd like to purchase this material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page, I'll have the links in the description, and that's also a great way to help support this channel. And if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Ultimate Procedural Material Pack, and my Ultimate Procedural Material Pack comes with all of my procedural materials, and they're pre-set up for Blender's Asset Browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So I'll now show you my scene setup if you want to set up the Blender file the same way that I have. So here in the 3D viewport, I'll press Shift-A, and I'll add a cube, and then I'll hit the Tab key to go into edit mode, and I'm going to scale this object up on the x-axis, and I'll just type in 2 and then Enter, and then I can go back to object mode. So now we have a longer object, and that'll be better for the shape of the cloud. Then I also added a camera here, and I just pointed the camera kind of down here, looking up at the object. Now for the lighting, I added in this Klufendall 48D PureSky HDRI. This is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So you can download the HDRI, and then here in Blender you can add a new world, and you can click on the yellow dot next to color, and you can choose environment texture, and then you can click on open and open up the HDRI. And this will give us some nice realistic sky lighting. And I didn't want it to be very bright, so I turned the strength down to 0.5, just so that the sky was a little bit less bright. And then also to get some nice bright sun lighting, I added this sunlight right here. So if you press Shift-A, you can go down here to light, and you can add a sunlight. And then if you go right over here to the object data properties, I turned the color to a very subtle yellow color, and I turned the strength up to 10, and just pointed it kind of on the side here, down at the object. And then while you're in the rendered viewport mode, if you want the background to be transparent, then you can go here to the render properties, and you can open up the film tab, and you can just check mark this transparent button. So this way you won't be able to see the HDRI in the background, and I just like to do that because it makes it a bit less distracting. And then also to make the colors look a bit nicer, I'm going to open up this color management here, and I'll be using the filmic view transform, and the look to very high contrast. So now I'm going to click right up here to go to the shading workspace. So in the shading workspace, I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm going to go up into the rendered mode, and then I'll select the object, and over here I have the shader editor. So I'll click on new to add a new material, and I can call this procedural cloud. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the node wrangler enabled, you can click here on edit, and you can go to the preferences, and then over there on the add-ons tab, just search for node wrangler, and you can check mark the node wrangler add-on. Now for this cloud material, I don't want to use the principled shader, I want to use the volume instead. So I'm going to press shift a, go to the search, and I'm going to start to search for a volume, and we're going to add the principled volume node. And I want to select the principled shader, and hit x to delete it, and then I want to plug the volume up to the volume of the material output. We don't want to plug anything up to the surface, because this isn't a surface, this is a volume material. So the volume needs to go into the volume of the material output. And so already now you can see this material is starting to look like clouds. Now here on the color, I want to make this fully white. Of course if you want to make it like a rain cloud, or if you're going for some kind of like abstract fog, or abstract smoke, you could make this a different color. I'm just going to make it fully white. And then here on the density value, you can drag this up and down if you want to make the cloud more dense or less dense. But instead of dragging around a single value, I just want to have it be more dense in the center, but then as it goes out to the sides, I want it to be more transparent, and I don't want there to be any fog on the side. So we need to create a texture here, and we'll plug the texture into the density to tell it where the density is going to be on the object. So I'll press shift a, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a gradient texture. Let's drop this here, and then I want to click on the linear, and I want to change this to the quadric sphere instead. And then using the feature of the node wrangler, I can ctrl shift and select the gradient texture to preview it. So this gradient texture is actually 3d, so it's not just flat on the object, it's actually in 3d space. And so you can see right down here in the corner, it's very white, and you can basically think of this as like a 3d sphere. So we want to take this white gradient sphere here, and we want to put it in the center of the object. And that'll tell it that the principled volume is going to be more dense just in the center. So with the gradient texture selected, I'm going to press ctrl T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And I want to use the generated coordinates. So you can leave the generated going into the vector the mapping. Now we can use this mapping node to move the gradient around. So if I move the location x, the location y and location z, that's going to move the gradient around. And so I'm going to turn these all to the same number. So I'm going to click and then drag down and then let go. And this way, we can change all the values at the same time. And I'm going to turn this to a negative point five. So just type negative point five and enter. And now you can see that because we brought this over by a negative point five on all values, the gradient is now in the very center of the object. Now I want this sphere to be smaller. So I'll press shift A, I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's put the color ramp after the gradient. And I can box select these nodes and drag them back. So I have a bit more space. So I can now drag the black tab over. And that's going to change the contrast. And so now you can see the white sphere is much smaller. And so I actually want to drag the black tab to about here. And then also the white tab, I'm going to drag this over. So it's a bit more contrasty. And I'll drag the white tab to here. Now you can't really see the gradient, but the gradient is there inside the 3d space of the object. It's just that you can't see it on the edges, because it's not reaching the edges and actually see the size of this, I can take the color, and I can put that into the density, the principal volume. And then I just want to unplug any wires from the surface. And that way we can preview it. So you can see now if I drag this white tab over, that'll make it more dense. And then the black tab will control the size of it. So now we basically have a 3d sphere in the center of our object. Now the material of this does look a lot like clouds, but the shape is definitely not like clouds. And so I want to distort this and make this much more random and noisy. So it looks more like a cloud. So I'll press shift a, I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And let's drop the noise under the gradient. And then I want to drag the mapping up here. And then for the noise texture, I want to use the object coordinates. So let's put the object into the vector, and I can control shift and select the noise texture and preview it. And then I do want to use a mapping node later when we create a custom node group for this. So I'll select this mapping, I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and I want to drop this mapping in between the texture coordinate and the noise texture. But then I want to click on the mapping, and I'll hit the backspace with the mapping selected, and that'll reset the mapping node. So then these are all turned back to their default values. So now we can change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to two, because I want that to be smaller. I also want this to be very detailed. So let's turn the detail up to the max. And then I'll also turn the roughness up a little bit to like a point five, five. And also this distortion value, I'm going to turn this up to like a point four. So there's a little bit of distortion. So I now want to mix this noise texture into the gradient texture, so it distorts the gradient. So I'm going to click and drag and box select these nodes and move them back a bit. And then right here after the gradient, I'll press shift A, I'll go here to color and I'm going to add the mix color. And let's put this right here after the gradient but before the color ramp. And then I want to click on the mix here and I want to change this instead to the linear light. And I want the gradient texture color to be going into color A. And then I want the noise texture factor to be going into color B. And then to preview this, I can just go here to the surface and I'll unplug this wire from the surface. So I can just preview the volume again. So I can now go back to the mix node, and I can drag this factor around. And if I turn the factor all the way to zero, it's just using the gradient texture. But we have the mix node set to linear light. And what this will do is it'll make it so that as I turn the factor up, it's going to make the noise texture affect the gradient more and more. So now you can see it looks much more like a real cloud. And so on this factor value here, I'm going to turn this to a 0.4 because I think that looks pretty good. Now I want to add even more distortion and detail to the cloud. So I'm going to click on this noise texture, and I'm going to press control shift D that will duplicate the node but keep the wire plugged up. And I'll put this noise texture here under the first one. And I'll control shift and select this noise texture to preview it. And then I want to change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale here to a 1.6, also leave the detail at the max of 15, and the roughness here at 0.55. But then this distortion here, I'm going to turn this all the way up to one so that it is even more distorted. So I now want to make this noise texture more contrasty because it is pretty gray right now. So I'm going to select this color ramp, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it. And I'm going to stick it here under the first one, and it's going to go here in the wire after this noise texture. And then with the color ramp selected, I'll just hit the backspace, and that is going to reset the color ramp. Now for the color ramp tabs here, I actually want to switch these. So I'm going to put the white one over here. And then this black one, I'm going to put to about over here. But now you can see it's more contrasty, and there's much more dark areas. So I now want to take this noise texture, and I want to mix it in with this gradient texture that we've created. So I'm going to take this linear light here, this mix node, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it. And we're going to drop it here after this color ramp. And so we're now going to mix both of these color ramps together. So I'm going to drag this down, and this top color ramp up here, I want to put this into the factor. And then I want this bottom color ramp here to be going into color B. And so then again, to preview this, I just want to take the material output here on the surface, and I want to unplug that value from the surface. So now back here on this mix node, to make this look like a cloud, we're going to take color A, and we're going to make this fully black. Now you can see that all around it is transparent, and you can just see the cloud in the center. But this now has so much more detail than our first cloud setup, because we're mixing it together with this other noise texture. And you can also drag around these tabs if you want to. So you can drag these over here if you want to make the cloud a bit smaller, or you can make the cloud a bit bigger. And also down here on this color ramp, you can drag this around. So if I drag both these over here, now the cloud is going to be very hard to see. Or if I drag these over here, the cloud is going to be much more dense and easy to see. Now later on when we create the custom node group, I want to be able to control more of these values. And so when we drag the color ramp values around, that is making the texture lighter or darker. So a super easy way to control that in the node group is to just press Shift A, go here to the search, and we can add the hue saturation value. So we're going to put this hue saturation value in between this noise texture and this bottom color ramp. So now this value is going to make it lighter or darker. So if I drag this around, if I turn this way down, you can see the cloud is more dense. Or if I turn this down, you can see through the cloud much better. And then after this color ramp, we could also add another hue saturation value to give us more customizable settings. So let's take the hue saturation value, I'll press Shift D to duplicate it, and let's drop it here after this bottom color ramp. But because these two hue saturation values are at different parts of the node setup, they are going to affect it differently. And then I do want to add one more hue saturation value that we'll control in the custom node group. And that is going to be right here. So I'll click on the hue saturation value, I'll press Shift D to duplicate it, and I'll drop it here before this color ramp. And so I can drag the value up and down. And you can see the cloud is going to be bigger or smaller because this is making the values lighter or darker. Now the last thing that I want to do in this node setup is make another node to make the entire cloud more dense. So if I press Shift A and go to the search, I can search for the math node. And we want to put the math node right here in between the linear light and the density of the principled volume. And then I want to take the add here and I want to change this to multiply. This value here is going to multiply the values. So if I turn this way up, now you can see the cloud looks very thick and dense, or I could turn this way down if I want the cloud to be very subtle. And I'm going to turn this value to a level of eight on default because I think that looks pretty nice. So now we have a nice puffy cloud and you can see it pretty well. And there we have it. So there is the procedural cloud material. So to make this cloud material easier to work with, I'm going to join it together into a custom node group. So I'm going to click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output. And then I can press Control G and that is going to join the nodes into a node group. And if you press the tab key with the node group selected, that'll go in and out of the node group. So I'm going to drag the node group bigger just so it's a bit bigger and easier to see. And I'll just drag it over here and then I can rename this. So I'll click here on the material name. I'll use Control C to copy the name and then I can click here on the node group and I'll press Control V to paste the name. So I'll select the node group and hit the tab key to go into the node group. And then I can hit the N key that'll open up the side panel here. And if you go to group, there are different inputs and outputs. So then if I navigate here to the back, we have this group input and we can plug values into the group input to control it outside of the node group. So I want to start by adding the entire scale of the clouds. So I'm going to drag the group input right over here and I'll bring it here next to this top hue saturation value. So this value here, this is going to change the size of the clouds because it's making the gradient lighter or darker. So I'll put this value into the extra socket here and then I can double click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to cloud scale. Now I also want to be able to control the color of the clouds. So let's go here to this principled volume and I'm going to take the color and I'm going to pull out a wire and stick this here into the extra socket. And then I can rename this one here on the side panel to cloud cup. Now I also want to be able to control the size of the noise. So if I drag this group input right down here, we have these two noise textures and you can see the scale values are different on each one of them, but this mapping node is being plugged up to both the noise. So I can take this scale. I want to take this wire here, put it into the extra socket. And then because this mapping is plugged up to both the noise textures, it'll control the size of both noise textures. And then if I click on the scale here, I want to click on the type and I want to change this to float so that it is one single value. Then here on the default value, I'll just turn this to one because that's the default value. And then if I hit the tab key to go out of the node group, I need to turn the scale back to one, which is the default, but now that'll control the size of the noise. So let's go back into the node group. Now I also want to be able to control the visibility of the clouds. So if I go here to this hue saturation value, this value here will change the visibility. So if I turn this down, it's really thick. You can see it really well, or I can turn this down and it's hard to see. So let's take this value here. I'll put that into the extra socket, and then I can rename this to visibility. And then if I go here to the second hue saturation value, this one here is going to change the sharpness of the clouds. Because if I turn this way up, you can see the edges are really quite sharp. So I'm going to take this value, pull out a wire, drag it over here, stick it into the extra socket, and I'll rename this custom value to sharpness. And then I also want to control the amount of noise on the edge of the clouds. So if I go up here to this top linear light, this factor value is going to make the edges more noisy, or it's going to make the edges more smooth. You can see if I turn this down, now the cloud is very circular. So I'll put the factor into the extra socket here, and I can click on this to rename it, and I'm going to call it edge noise. Now I also want to control the clouds detail, and on both of these noise textures we have these detail values. So I'll plug the first one here into this socket here, and then I want to take this detail of the next noise texture, and I want to put it into the same socket. And this way, if I go outside of the node group, this detail value will control the detail for both of the textures at once. So we can go back into the node group. Now I also want to be able to control the amount of distortion, so both of these noise textures have distortion values. So you can see what this one does here, and then also this one kind of does distort it, but a little bit differently. So I'm going to put this distortion right in here, and then on the other noise texture, this distortion here, I'll put that into another socket, because I want to be able to control it separately. And then here on the name, I'm going to rename this one to distortion one, and this one here I'll rename to distortion two. Now if I change the roughness of these noise textures, that is going to make it more smooth. So if I turn this way up, you can see it's quite smooth. And the same thing for this one, if I turn the roughness up, it is very smooth. So I'll take the roughness, put that into the extra socket, and then this other roughness from this noise texture, we'll put that into another socket. And then I can click on this to rename this, and I'll rename this one to smoothness one. And then this bottom socket here, I'm going to rename this one to smoothness two. And then lastly, I also want to control the density of the clouds. So we have this multiply here, this math node. So let's take the value, I can drag this over here, stick this into the extra socket, and I'll rename this one to density. So I can hit the tab key to go out of the node group, and I'll press the N key to close the side panel. And there we have it. So there's all the custom values. So we have the cloud scale, and we also have the clouds color, we also have the noise scale. And it looks like I forgot to rename this to noise scale. So real quick, if I go back into the node group, right here on this scale, I want to rename this one to a noise scale. So outside of the node group, we have now have the noise scale. And then we also have the visibility here. So I can make this more and less visible. We also have the sharpness, so I can make this really sharp. We also have the edge noise. So if I want this very noisy, I could turn that way up. Or if I turn this down, it's a much rounder cloud. And then we also have the amount of detail. And then we have two different distortion values. So this first one here is kind of going to make the edges a bit more wispy. And then the second one here, this will make kind of the inside of the cloud a bit more wispy and distorted. We also have some smoothness values, so I can make that really smooth. Or I have this other smoothness value right here. And then finally, we have the density. So if I want this to look like a really thick rain cloud, I can turn the density up. Or if I want to be kind of a very thin cloud that you can see through, I can turn the density way down. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and I hope you found it helpful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5rwaimsZs0,Procedural Checkered Kitchen Marble Floor Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural checkered kitchen marble floor material in Blender, showcasing its appearance within a kitchen scene using assets from their Furniture and Home Asset Pack for Blender. The tutorial emphasizes using Cycles Render for realism, although it also works well in Blender Eevee. The creator details the process of setting up the material, including customizing various aspects like marble scale, detail, distortion, checker colors, roughness, and bump strength. They also provide information on purchasing the material and their asset packs on Gumroad and Patreon, and encourage viewers to explore their procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube.","In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create this procedural checkered kitchen marble floor material in Blender. And to see how this checkered marble floor material looks in a kitchen scene, I added it into this kitchen scene here, which I created. And I do think it looks really nice in this kitchen scene. And the 3D models and 3D assets that I use to create this kitchen scene are from my recently released product, my Furniture and Home Asset Pack for Blender. If you'd like to check out that model pack, I'll have the links in the description. So here is the procedural material. And I am going to be using Cycles Render for this material because I am going for realism. But this material actually works really well in Blender Eevee. You can see here's the material in Blender Eevee. And it pretty much looks exactly the same. And there isn't any lag in the viewport. And it looks quite nice. So you could do this in Cycles or Eevee. It'll work great in both. So then after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group. So we have the overall scale of the material. And then we just have the marble scale. Then we have the marble detail 1. And then we also have this marble detail 2 value. And then we also have the marble distortion. Then we also have the checker color 1. So this will change the color of the white checkers. Then we also have marble color 1. And this will change the color of the marble in the white checkers. And then we have the same thing. So checker color 2, this is the color of the dark checkers. And then marble color 2, and this is the color of the marble in the black checkers. Then we have just the checkers scale. And then we also have the roughness of the material. Then we also do have a bump strength if you want to add some bump. And then finally, we have the checker rotation. So I have it set to 45 on default. But you could turn it to 0 if you don't want there to be any rotation. And if you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this material, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description. And if you like using procedural materials in your projects, then another great way to help support me and this channel is by checking out my ultimate Blender procedural material pack. And my ultimate procedural material pack comes with all of my procedural materials. And they're all pre-set up in Blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails, sorted catalogs, and customizable node groups. And you'll also get future updates with more procedural materials as I create them. You can also check out my procedural material packs. And those are packs of 10 materials. And you can also get each one of my materials individually on my Gumroad and Patreon. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, then definitely check out my procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So real quick, I'll go over my scene setup if you want to set up the blend file the same way that I have. Or you can use the timestamps in the description to jump straight to the material. So I'll press Shift-A. I'll go to Mesh and add a plane. And I'll scale the plane down by 0.2. Then I can use Control-A to just apply the scale. So this is the object's new default size. Then I can also rotate the plane. I'll rotate it on the x-axis by 90 and then hit Enter, just that it's rotated over so we get some nice reflections. Then I also added a camera in the scene. So if you press Shift-A, you can add a camera. And I just pointed the camera at this plane. And if you select the camera and then go over here to the object data properties, I turned the focal length up to 80 just so that the camera is zoomed in a bit. And also, if you want to make the camera a square image, if you go to the output properties, you can set the resolution X and Y to the same amount. Now for the lighting over here on the world properties, I added in this Artist Workshop HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Link will be in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So when you download the HDRI, you can add a new world and you can click on the yellow dot next to color and you can choose environment texture and then you can just open up the HDRI. And then if I hold down the Z button and go up into the rendered view, it'll give us some nice lighting. Now we did want to have some nice reflections reflecting off of this material. So I also pressed shift A, I went here to light and added an area light. And then if you select the area light and go over here to the object data properties, I turned the shape to rectangle and I changed the X size and the Y size so that we have this nice little beam of light and I just pointed it kind of on the side here on the plane. And then I turned the power to five and I turned the color to a subtle blue color. And this will give a nice reflection on the floor. And then if you don't want to be able to see the HDRI in the background, then you can click here on the render properties and you can open up the film tab and you can just check mark the transparent button and that way you won't be able to see the HDRI in the background. And then also to make the colors a bit nicer, I'll go here to the color management and I'm going to use the view transform of filmic and I'll set the look to high contrast so that'll pop out the colors and make everything more contrasty and saturated. So I am in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D viewport right over here and I am in the rendered mode. And then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'm just going to select the plane object and then let me make this smaller so I have more space. And then I'll click here on new to add a new material. And I'm going to rename this material to checkered kitchen marble floor. And then before we create the material, I will be using the node wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So to enable the node wrangler, you can go to edit and go to preferences and then go over there to the add-ons tab and search for node wrangler and you can check mark the node wrangler add-on and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So we're going to start off by creating the marble texture. So here in the shader editor, I'll press shift A, I'm going to go to the search and I'll search for a noise texture. Let's drop this down here. And then if you control shift and select different nodes, that is going to preview the node on the object and that's using the feature of the node wrangler by control shift and selecting the nodes. Now with the noise texture selected, I'm also going to press control T to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And this will tell the noise texture how it's going to be placed on the object. And I want to use the object coordinates. So let's put the object into the vector. And then this mapping here can be used to change the entire size of the material. So now let's change the noise texture settings. So I'll turn the scale up to like a 20 and then I want it to be very detailed. So let's turn the detail all the way up to the max. And then I do want a bit more roughness because that'll add a bit more detail. So I'll turn the roughness to a 0.55. And then I will turn the distortion a little bit up to like a 0.3. Now that kind of does look a bit simple and I do want to add much more detail and make it look a bit more like marble. So I'm going to take the noise texture and I'll press shift D to duplicate it. And I'm going to stick this other noise texture in between the mapping and this noise. And so because this noise texture is in between the mapping and the noise, it's going to distort the placement of this noise texture. And then this noise texture here that we just added, I do want to change some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale down a bit. So I'll turn the scale to eight, but then I do want it to be very detailed. So I'll leave the detail at 15 and I'll leave the roughness at 0.55. But then I don't want any distortion. So I'll turn the distortion to zero. But now you can see we have a much more interesting marble texture. Now I want to make this marble texture look much more contrasty. So I'll bring the principle shader down and I'll press shift A. Let's go to the search and I'll search for a color ramp and let's put the color ramp after this noise texture. And then I can drag around these tabs and that is going to make it more contrasty. So I'm going to drag the black tab to kind of about here and then also the white tab to about there. So now we have a nice marble texture. Now, when we create the custom node group, I want to be able to control the colors. So I'll press shift A. I'm going to go here to color and I'm going to add the mix color node. And we're going to drop this here after the color ramp. Now on the mix node, the factor is determining where it's going to be color A and where it's going to be color B. So I want to take this color ramp here and I'll put the color into the factor. So I'll control shift and select the mix to preview it. So here on color A, I'll just make this fully black. And then here on color B, I'm going to make this fully white. So if I control shift and select between the color ramp and the mix, you can see it actually doesn't look any different, but now we have these custom colors and we can plug this into the custom node group. And so this will give us the option to control the custom colors. So this node set up here is the light marble texture, but I also want to make a dark marble texture, which we're going to put in the dark checkers. So I'm going to click and drag to box select the noise, the color ramp and the mix, and I'll bring these up here, but we're not going to select this other noise, just one noise, the color ramp and the mix. And I'm going to press control shift D that'll duplicate the nodes, but it'll keep the wires plugged up. And so I'm going to put these duplicated nodes underneath the top ones and I'll control shift and select the mix to preview it. So we can now change some of the settings to make it look like dark marble. So on this bottom noise texture, I'm going to turn the scale to 15, and then I'll also leave the detail at 15 and the roughness to 0.55. But then this distortion, I want it to be more distorted. So I'll turn the distortion to one. And then I want to make this a dark marble instead of a light marble. So I can drag the color ramp around and I want to drag the black tab much farther over. So there's going to be more black area. And so now it is much darker. So I'll drag the black tab to about here and then the white tab I can kind of drag to about there. So now we have some dark marble and it just has some little white areas. And then this mix node is controlling the light and dark values. So we can use this later in the custom node group. So I can now control shift and select the two mix nodes. And you can see we have light marble and dark marble. So I now want to create the checker texture and then we'll mix them together. So I'm going to click and drag and select these nodes and then I can just drag them over so I have a bit more space. So I'll now press shift A. I'll go here to the search and I'm going to search for the checker texture. And let's just drop this down here and I can control shift and select the checker texture to preview it. Now I do want to turn the scale up. So I'm going to turn the scale to a 12. But then I also want to use the object coordinates and I also want to plug it into this mapping because this mapping will change the entire size of the material because it's plugged up to all the textures. So let's take the mapping vector and we're going to plug this into the vector of the checker texture. Now I want to rotate the checker texture around. So what I'm going to do is select this mapping node and I'll press shift to duplicate it and I'm going to drop it here before the checker texture. And I can just drag the mapping here underneath this noise. So this mapping is going into the second mapping and then this mapping is going into the checker texture. So I now just want to rotate the texture so we can take the mapping rotation Z value and we can just turn this around. And I'm going to type in 45. So now that looks like a checkered kitchen floor. So now here on color one, I want to add in the light marble and then here on color two, I want to add the dark marble. So on this top mix, I'll put the result into color one and then this bottom mix, I'll put the result into color two. So now you can see we have the light marble and the dark marble. So I can now take the checker texture color and we're going to put that into the base color of the principled shader and I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview the material. And I'll drag the checker texture up here. Now I want to turn the roughness down to make it more shiny. So let's turn the roughness down. But instead of just turning the roughness down, I actually want to add a noise texture into the roughness so that there's a bit of variation. So some parts are a bit more rough and other parts are a bit more shiny. So I'll press shift A, I'll go to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's just drop the noise texture right here. And then again, I want this mapping to control the entire size of the material. So let's take the vector and I can put that into the vector of this noise texture. And then I can control shift and select this noise texture to preview it. So let's now change some of the settings. So I'll turn the scale to 10 and then let's turn the detail all the way up so it's very detailed. And I do want to add a lot of roughness. So I'll turn the roughness up to like a 0.7 so it's even more detailed. So now this factor value can go into the roughness value. So the light and dark values are going to control where it'll be more rough and where it'll be more shiny. And I'll control shift and select the pressable shader. Now it's not very contrasty and I want to be able to control the roughness better. So I'll press shift A, I'll go to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp and let's put the color ramp after this noise texture but before the roughness. So I can now drag these tabs around and that is going to make it more contrasty. So if there is more black values then it's going to be more shiny but if there's more white values, it's going to be more rough. So I'll drag the black tab to about here and this white tab I'll drag kind of to about here but I do want the entire thing to be more shiny. So I want to just make the entire thing darker. So I'll click on the white tab here and I'm just going to make this kind of like a mid gray color. And if you want to use the exact same gray color that I'm using, then you can go over here to the hex value and you can punch in A8, A8, A8. So now if I just kind of look around here on the material, look at the reflections, you can see it is a bit shiny. Now, later on when we create the custom node group I want to be able to control the roughness. So I'll press Shift A and I'll go to the search and I'll search for the hue saturation value and let's put this in between the roughness and the color ramp. We have this value right here and so if I drag this up and down it's going to make it lighter or darker. And so that is going to control the roughness. So we can use this later in the custom node group. And then the last thing that I want to do is to add just a tiny little bit of bump just to make a very subtle bump on the surface. So let's take the noise texture factor and I can put that into the normal but then we need to convert this to proper normal data. So I'll press Shift A and I'll go to the search and I'm going to search for a bump node and let's put the bump node in between the noise texture and the principle shader. And then to convert the noise texture black and white data into normal data, we actually want to put the noise texture factor into the height value. So now you can see it looks very bumpy. However, this is way too bumpy and I want the bump to be very, very subtle because the marble surface should be pretty smooth. So on the bump strength, I'm going to turn this to a 0.005 and that way it will be very, very subtle but kind of in the reflections you can see just a little bit of subtle bump. And there we have it. So there is the finished procedural material. So I'm now going to show you how to join it together into a custom node group. So I'm going to click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output. And then you can use Control G and that is going to join it together into a node group. And I'm going to click up here and then press Control C to copy the name of the material. And if you press the tab key, that'll go in and out of the node group. So I'll drag the node group over here to the material output and I'll zoom in. And I'm also going to click here to make it bigger. And if I click here on the node group name, I can now press Control V just to paste the name. So with the node group selected, I'll hit the tab key to go into the node group and then I'll press the N key to open up this side panel. And I'm going to click right over here on the group tab. And you can see there are inputs and outputs. Now here on the outputs, I want to double click on this to rename it. And I'm going to rename the output to shader because now outside of the node group, you can see it's just called shader and I do like that a bit better. So I will go back into the node group. And if I go right over here, you can see there is this group input and we can plug values up into the group input to control them outside of the node group. So I'll just drag the group input down here. And I first want to take this scale from the mapping and let's put that into the group input. Now outside of the node group, this is split up into three values, but I just want it to be one value. So if you hit the tab key to go back into the node group, you can click here on the scale input. And to make this one single value, we can change the type here from vector to float. And then I want to turn the default value back to one. And then I need to go outside of the node group. I need to turn the scale back to one. And then I can hit the tab key to go back into the node group. So I now want to be able to control the marble scale. So I'll drag the group input right up here and we can take this noise texture scale. Let's put that into the group input. And then I can click on this to rename it. And I'm going to rename this to marble scale. So then outside of the node group, you can see we have this marble scale and that'll just change the size of the marble. So let's go back into the node group. And I also want to add two detail levels for the marble. So I'm going to use this detail here and also this roughness here. So I'll put the detail into the extra socket and also this roughness, I'll put that into the extra socket. And then right here on the side panel, I can click on these to rename them. And I'm going to rename the first one to marble detail one. And then I will click here on the name. I'll use control C to copy the name and click here on the roughness. And I'll paste that with control V. And I want to rename this one instead to marble detail two. So now we have two custom values to change the detail of the marble. And then I also want to control the distortion. So let's put the distortion here into the extra socket. And I can just rename this to marble distortion. And then I want to be able to control the custom colors. So I'll click on the group input and I'm going to drag it right over here above the mix nodes. And actually first want to take this mix here. I want to take color B and I'm going to put that into the extra socket. And then I'm going to take color A on the top mix and I'll put that into the extra socket. So then I can just click on these to rename this. And this white one here, this is going to be the checker color. So I'll call this one checker color one. And then right here, I'll click on this to rename this one. And I'm going to rename this one to marble color one. And then I want to do that for the other mix node down here. So I'll take color A and I'll put that into the extra socket and then color B, put that into the extra socket. So this first one here, this one was the black one. So I'm going to rename this one to checker color two. And then this one here, this is going to be marble color two. So then outside of the node group, we have four different colors for both of the marbles and both of the checker colors. So let's go back into the node group. I also want to control the checker scale. So right here on the checker texture, we have the scale. So I'm going to drag out a wire here and I'll stick this into the extra socket. And then I can click on this to rename it and I'll rename this to checker scale. And then I want to also be able to control the roughness and the bump strength. So I'll drag this group input right down here and we can take this value from the hue saturation value. That's going to make it lighter or darker. So it'll control the roughness. So I'll put the value into the extra socket here and then I can click on this to rename it and I'll rename it to roughness. And then I want to be able to control the bump strength. So I'll just take the strength here, put that to the extra socket, and then I can rename this to bump strength. And then finally, I want to be able to control the rotation of the checkers. So I'm going to drag the group input back here and we can take this second mapping, we can take the rotation and let's stick this into the extra socket. And then if I click here to rename this, I can rename this to checker rotation. All right, so I'll drag this back here and I can tab to go out of the node group and I'll press the N key to close the side panel. And real quick, just to preview the final material, I'll change the rendering engine over to Blender Eevee so that it is in real time. So we have the overall size of the material, then we just have the marble scale, then we have the marble detail and the second marble detail. And then we also have this marble distortion. Then we have checker color one, and this is the light checker. Then we have marble color one, this is going to be the color in the light checkers. And then we also have checker color two, and this is going to be the color of the black checkers. And then marble color two is going to be the marble texture in the black checkers. Then we have the checkerscale, and then we also have the roughness of the material. We also have the bump strength if you want to make that more bumpy. And then finally, we have the checker roughness. So I hope you enjoyed this, and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPY3R9QRwsA,Procedural Lumpy Clay Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor demonstrates how to create a procedural lumpy clay material. The process includes setting up a custom node group with adjustable parameters such as color, subsurface scattering, noise scale, and displacement strength. The instructor provides detailed guidance on organizing and combining various textures and nodes to achieve the desired clay effect. Additionally, they explain how to set up the scene using an icosphere, monkey head, and appropriate lighting for realistic rendering with the Cycles engine. The tutorial ends with information on where viewers can purchase the material or explore more of the instructor's resources.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural lumpy clay material in Blender. And then after we create the procedural material, I'm going to show you how to join it together into this custom node group. So we have the overall scale of the material, and then we also have color 1 and color 2 to change the clay color. And then we also have the amount of subsurf. And then we also have the subsurface color. Then we have just the noise scale, and then we have the noise detail. And then we also have the voronoi scale. And then we have just the bumpy scale. Then we also have the roughness of the clay. Then we have the bump strength, that's the little bump on the surface. And then finally we have the displacement strength.

And you can also check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack if you'd like to purchase all of my materials. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I press Shift-A, and I went here to Mesh, and I added an icosphere. And then right behind me, after you add the icosphere here in the subdivisions, I turned it up to 6. And that way we have more geometry for the displacements to use. But then the default primitive objects in Blender are quite large. This object is a little bit higher than an average human when using the real life scale in Blender. So I scaled the object down by 0.2. And then using Ctrl-A, you can apply the object scale. And I did the same thing for the monkey head. So I pressed Shift-A, I added a monkey head, and then I scaled it down by about 0.2. And then you can press Ctrl-A and apply the scale. And then also you can press Ctrl-2, and that is going to give the monkey a subdivision surface modifier. And then with the object selected, using the object context menu, you can just shade the object smooth. And then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera and go to the camera settings, I turned the focal length up to 80, just so that the camera is zoomed in a bit more. Now for the lighting, if you click right over here on the world properties, I added in the AbandonedHopperTerminal01. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Link's in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So once you download the HDRI, you can add a new world, and you can click here on color and choose environment texture. And then you can click on the open button and add in the HDRI. And this will give some nice realistic lighting and reflections. And then I also added this area light right here. And if you go to the object data properties, I turned the power up to 50 so that it was nice and bright, and just pointed it at the objects. And then if you click right over here on the render properties, here on the rendering engine, I am going to be using the Cycles rendering engine because I am going for realism. And I want to use the material displacement so that the clay looks all lumpy. And then also if you go down here to the color management, I'm using the view transform of filmic and the look to very high contrast. And then if you go into the rendered view, you can see the background is transparent so I can't see the HDRI. So if you want to make the background transparent, you can open up the film tab and then just check mark the transparent button. So you can select the object and if you click right over here to go to the shading workspace, you should have the shader editor here in the workspace. So I'm going to click on new to add a new material and I will rename the material. And then I can click and drag and I can drop the same material on this object as well. And then if you open up the side panel here and go down here to the material properties, and you want to go down here to settings, and then you want to open up the surface. And under the displacement, this is set to bump only, but we want to change this to displacement and bump. And that way we're telling the material that it can use the displacements. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add-on in this video to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the node wrangler enabled, you can click on edit and go to the preferences. And then over there on the add-ons tab, just search for node wrangler and you can check mark the node wrangler add-on. So let's start by making the main texture. So I'll press shift A, I'll go to the search, I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's drop this down here. And then because we turned on the node wrangler add-on, we can hold down the ctrl and shift key and select different nodes. And that'll preview the node on the object. And also with the noise texture selected, I'll press ctrl T. That'll add the texture coordinate and mapping. And I want to use the object coordinates. So let's put the object into the vector and the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the object more evenly. And then let's change the noise texture settings. So I want to turn the scale up to like 18. I also want it to be very detailed. So I'll turn the detail to the max of 15. I also want to turn the roughness up. So I'll turn the roughness to like a 0.6. And then I do think it would be nice to have a little bit of distortion. So I'll turn that to 0.1. Now this noise texture isn't very interesting. So I want to mix it with another texture to make it look a bit more bumpy. So I'll press shift A and I'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture. Let's drop this up here. And I can ctrl shift and select it to preview it. And let's take the vector from the mapping and put that into the vector, the Voronoi, so that it's using the object coordinates. And then I can change some of the settings. So I want to see many more of those dots. So I'm going to turn the scale up to like 825 so I can see many more of those dots. Now I want to mix the Voronoi texture with the noise texture. So to do this I'm going to press shift A. I'm going to go to color and I'm going to search for the mix color. Let's just drop this here. And I want to click on the mix and I want to change this instead to linear light. And then I can ctrl shift and select it to preview it. Now I want to take the Voronoi texture distance and I'm going to put that into the factor. And then I want to take this noise texture and I'm going to put the factor into color B. And then here on color A, I want to make this a darker color. So I'm going to make it kind of like a mid gray color. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using here on color A, you can go to the hex value and you can punch in 6A, 6A, 6A. So now we have this much more interesting texture. And the noise texture is more contrasty because there's some light areas and some dark areas. And then we have those gray dots all over the texture. But I want to make this a very lumpy clay material. So I'm going to mix it with another noise texture, which is going to be much larger and have less detail. So I'm going to select the noise texture and I'll press ctrl shift D. That'll duplicate the node, but keep the wire plugged up. And I'm going to stick this down here. And then with the noise texture selected, I'm going to hit the backspace and that's going to reset the noise texture. So we can now ctrl shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And then let's change some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to like a 14. And then I also don't want any detail. So I'll turn the detail to zero. And then here on the roughness, I will turn this up a little bit. So I'll turn it to a 0.6. And then the distortion, I will turn that up to just a 0.1. So it is slightly distorted. So we now have this very lumpy texture, and I'm going to mix that in with these two textures. So I'm going to select the mix node, the linear light, I'll press shift D to duplicate it, drop it here. And if I click on the linear light, I'm going to change this to lighten instead. So it just adds the light values, then I want to take the noise texture factor, and I'm going to put that into color B. And let's ctrl shift and select the lighten. And then I want the linear light to be going into color A. So now you can see there are those lighter and darker areas, but you can also see the more noisy detail. And let's also turn the factor down a little bit. So I'm going to turn the factor to 0.4. So we can now put this into the normal. So let's drag these nodes back. And I'm going to put the result into the normal to give it some bump. But then I need to convert this to normal data, because this is color data, and this is normal data. So I'll press shift A and we'll go to the search. And I'm going to search for the bump node. And let's put this in between the lighten and the normal. And then we want the lighten to be going into the height value. And that's the way it's going to convert it to normal data. So I can ctrl shift and select the bump, you can see there's the normal data, and I can ctrl shift and select the principled shader. So now it looks nice and bumpy, but that is actually way too strong. I want it to be pretty smooth. So I'm going to turn the strength to just like a point one on the bump. And that way it is much more subtle. So now let's also put this into the base color. So I'll take the lighten result, let's put that into the base color, but then I want to control the colors better. So I'll press shift A, I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for a mix node. Let's drop this here. And I can change the float to color instead. And then I want to put the mix between the lighten and the base color and actually want the result to be going into the factor. So now we can use color A and color B to make the two main colors for the clay. So right here on color B, I want to make this kind of like a brown color and a bit darker, but I don't want it to be very saturated. So I'll keep it kind of in the middle and make it a bit darker. And then here on this color, color A, I also want to make this a more gray color. And if you want to use the same colors that I'm using, then here on color B, the hex value is going to be 2f 2928. And then if you want to use the same color that I'm using for color A, the hex is going to be 757075. Now I want to make this a bit more contrasty, because it's kind of hard to see any difference in the color. So I'll press shift A, I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's put this between the lighten and the mix. So we can now drag these two tabs together. And that's going to make it more contrasty. And if I drag them really close to each other, now you can clearly see the difference in those two colors. I don't want it to be that contrasty, though. So I'm going to drag the white tab maybe to about there, and then the black tab I'll drag maybe to about there. But now you can see there's some little darker areas on the clay. Now I also want there to be some variation in the roughness. So let's take the lighten result, and I can put that into the roughness. But then I want to make it look a bit more dry. Right now it looks kind of wet. So I'll click on the color ramp, I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and I'll drop it down here. And then with the color ramp selected, I'll hit the backspace, and that is going to reset it. So if I make the colors lighter, that is going to be more rough. So I can click on the black tab here and click on the color, and I can make this brighter, and you can see it's going to be much more rough now. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using for the light gray, the hex value is going to be 87 87 87. But then I do want to be able to control the amount of roughness in the custom node group. So I'm going to press shift A, I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for the hue saturation value. And let's put that between the color ramp and the principled shader. So now this value, if I turn it up or turn it down, that's going to make it lighter or darker. And so that's going to make it more rough or more shiny. Now this clay doesn't look very bumpy right now. And that's because we haven't put any data into the displacement. So what I'm going to do is take this lighten, let's take the result and I can put that into the displacement. Now we need to convert this to proper displacement data because this is color data, but this needs to be displacement data. So I'll press shift A, I'll go to the search, and I'm going to search for the displacement node. Let's drop it right here in the wire. And then I can drag this down here just to get it out of the way. And I can also hold down the shift key and I can right click and drag over the wire and let go. And that's going to add a reroute and I can bring the reroute over here just so that the wires are not overlapping. And then to convert this to proper displacement data, I want this to actually be going into the height value of the displacement. And then here on the scale, right now it is way too strong. So I'm going to turn the scale way down to like a 0.02. But I can see it looks kind of lumpy. Now you can see right now it's kind of going in, it's almost like inverting. And so there are some places on the monkey where the vertices are overlapping. So to fix this, I'll press shift A, I'll go to the search, and I'll search for a color ramp. And we can drop this before it goes into the displacement. And then I actually want to flip these two values. So I'll drag the white tab over here, and then I'll drag the black tab over here. But then I just want to drag the black tab out a little bit so that it's not popping out quite as much. So I'll drag the black tab to about there. Now this is kind of looking like clay, but there is one more really important thing, and that is that I want to add some subsurface scattering. And this way it'll look a bit more smooth, and it'll allow some light to go through the object. So right here on the subsurface on the principal shader, I'm going to turn this to a very small number of 0.007. So now it just has a little bit of subsurface scattering, and it just looks a little bit more fleshy. And then here on the subsurface color, I want to make this kind of like a dark tannish color. And the subsurface color that I'm going to be using is a hex value of A0.7F65. Now you can see the subsurface scattering is looking very red, and it kind of looks like skin. But I want to change that, so I'm going to click here on the subsurface radius. And then I'm going to change all of these values on the subsurface radius just to one. So the subsurface radius values are going to be red, green, and blue values. So if you turn it up, you can see that's going to be more red, and more green, and more blue. I'm just going to turn them all to one so that there are even colors of the subsurface. But now you can see just by adding that little bit of subsurface, it makes it look more smooth, and it makes it look much more like clay. And then of course if you want to change how lumpy it is, you can change the scale. So you can turn this up, and you can see now it's going to be much more lumpy. And also you can change this scale value right here on this noise texture to make the lumps bigger or smaller. So that is the procedural material, so we're now going to join it together into the custom node group. So I'm going to click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output, and I'm going to press ctrl g. Ctrl g will join it together into a node group, and I can press the tab key to go in and out of the node group. So I'm going to drag the node group over here, and I can drag it out to make it bigger, and then I can rename the node group to lumpy clay. And then I'm going to select the node group, and I'll hit the tab key to go into the node group. And if I press the n key, that'll open up the side panel, and I can click right over here on group, and you can see there are inputs and outputs. So what I first want to do is click on the bsdf, and I want to click on the arrow to bring it up so it's on the top. And then I want to click on this to rename it, and I'm going to rename it to shader because I like that better. So you can see outside of the node group, we now have shader and displacement. Now to make all the custom values, we can go back into the node group with the tab key, and if I go right over here, you can see there is a group input. So we can plug all the values up to the group input that we want to control outside of the node group. So let's first do the scale. So this mapping node is being plugged into all of the textures, so we can use the scale to control the entire size of the material. So let's put the scale into the group input, but then I want this to be one single value because outside of the node group, it is three values. So if I go back into the node group and click here on scale, I want to click on the type, and I'm going to change this to float instead so it is one single value. And here on the default value, I also need to turn this up to one. And then if I go outside of the node group, you can see the scale is back to zero, so I just need to turn that to one, and then that is now the correct scale. So let's go back into the node group. Now I also want to add the different colors, so if I click on the group input, I can drag this over here. I'm going to drag it up here, and then I can take color A, let's put that into the extra socket, and then also color B, we can put that into the extra socket. And then if I click on this to rename this, I can rename this one to color one, double click on this, and I'm going to rename this to color two. So now outside of the node group, you can see we have the two different colors. So let's go back into the node group with the tab key. Now I also want to be able to control the subsurf, so right here there's the subsurf, let's put that in there. And then let's also take the subsurface color, and I can put that into the extra socket, so we now have the subsurface controls. And then I also want to control the noise scale, so let's drag the group input right back here behind the noise textures. And then let's take this noise texture here, let's take the scale, and I can put that into the extra socket. And then if I drag this down, I can click right here to rename this, and I'm going to rename this to noise scale. I also want to be able to control the noise detail, so let's put the detail into the extra socket, and then I can rename this to noise detail. And then I also want to be able to control the voronoi scale, so let's put that into the extra socket there. And then I can click on this, and I'll rename this to voronoi scale. Then I want to be able to control the size of those lumps, so let's take this noise texture here, this one is going to change the size of the lumps. Let's put the scale into the extra socket, and I can rename this to bumpy scale. Then I also want to be able to control the roughness, and so we can go back here to the hue saturation value, and we can use this value to make it lighter or darker. So let's take the value, we can drag this here into the extra socket, and then I can click on this to rename it, and I'll rename it to roughness. And then outside the node group, if we drag the roughness, that's going to make it more rough or more shiny. So let's go back into the node group, and I'm going to drag the group input down here. And I also want to control the bump strength, so let's take the strength, I can put that into the extra socket, and then I can click on this to rename it, and I'll rename that to bump strength. And then finally, I want to control the displacement strength, so let's put the scale into the extra socket, and I can rename this to displacement strength. And then I can drag this back over here, I'll just drag it right here above the texture coordinate, and I can hit the tab key to go outside of the node group. And I'll press N to close that side panel. So there we have it, there is the finished procedural material.

So this is a two part tutorial, so if you haven't seen Part 1 then you can check it out with the link in the description. So in Part 1 we did all the scene setup and we also created all of these different texture groups. So in this part we're going to be joining all the texture groups together, and we're also going to be creating the atmosphere, and then we're going to join the material together into a custom node group. And if you'd like to help support me and my YouTube channel, as well as purchase the material, then you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. Links are in the description. And you can also check out my Ultimate Procedural Material Pack if you'd like to purchase all of my materials. So to start off we're going to be mixing the Noise 1 group of textures with the Noise 2 group of textures. So what I'm going to do is click on this mix right here, and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it and let's drop it here. And I want to take the result from the first mix and I want to put that into color A, and then I'm going to take the Voronoi texture and let's put that into the factor. So if I Control-Shift and select this Voronoi texture, the light and dark values, because they're going into the factor, they're going to determine where it's going to be color A and where it's going to be color B. So let's Control-Shift and select the mix to preview it. And then here on color B, if I click on the color, I want to make this a little bit more saturated and a little bit darker. And if you want to use the same exact hex value that I'm using, then you can click on the hex value and you can punch in 4F3923. So now it looks much more detailed and interesting. So I now want to mix in the patches texture. So I'm going to drag the principled shader over here so I have more space and I can click on the mix and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it and let's drop it here. So we're going to put this mix result into color A, and then I want to take the patches color ramp and let's put the color into the factor. And so now you can see we have these little dark areas, but I'm going to click on this color and I want to make it a little bit more gray and then a little bit darker. And if you want to use the same color I'm using, you can go to the hex value and you can punch in 493B30. So I now want to mix in the canyons. So I'm going to click on this mix here, I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it and drop it here. And again, we want the mix result to be going into color A, and then I want the canyons color ramp, let's put the color into the factor. So now color B is going to be the canyons color. So I'm going to click on color B and I'm going to make this fully black. So now if I zoom in closely, if I click here on color B, I can make this lighter and darker and you can now see those little canyons. And then I also want to mix in the craters, so let's click on the mix here, I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it and drop it here. And then I want this mix result to be going into color A. Then I can go down here to the craters texture and I want to take the result from the lighten Let's drag this up here and I'm going to put the wire into the factor. So now if I zoom in here, you can see there's those little craters here and there. But then on this mix here, I don't want it to be black, so I'm going to click on this and I'm going to make it a bit brighter and then I'm going to make it a brown color. And the hex value that I'll be using for color B is going to be 593719. So you can see the craters are now that reddish brown. And then finally, I also want to mix in the ice poles. So I can drag the principal shader back, I can click on this mix and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it. I can drop it here and then if you go right up here, here's the poles. So I'm going to take the lighten from the ice poles and I'll take the result and I'm going to drag this way down here and I'm going to stick this over here into color B of the mix. And then this mix here is going to go into color A. So now if I go right up here to the top of Mars, if I turn this factor down, it's going to be blending it away and then if I turn the factor up, it's going to add more and more of it. But you can see it's actually just blending between both of the textures and I just want to add the light values. So let's click on the mix here and I can change this to lighten. So this way if I turn the factor up, it's just going to add the poles on top of Mars. So I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.15 and that way I can still kind of see the texture there underneath the poles, but now there's basically just ice over the poles. And then if I go back into the camera view by hitting the 0 on the numpad, you can see the poles right up there, but they're a bit hard to see. So I'm going to select the planet and I'm going to double tap the R key and then I'm just going to rotate the planet down and just kind of place it right there. And that way you can see the poles a bit better. So I'm now going to drag the material output behind the principled shader and I'll control shift and select the principled shader and I can drag these down here. So we can now take the final lighten. All of these mix nodes are mixing all the textures together so I can take the lighten result and I can put that into the base color. Now you can see that Mars is looking very shiny right now, but I want Mars to be very rough. So here on the roughness, I'm going to turn this to a 0.9 and now it looks very dry and cold and rough. And we haven't added the atmosphere yet, but we'll be doing that pretty soon. But the next thing that I want to do is add the bump because if you zoom into the planet, it looks very smooth. So I'll press shift A, I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for a bump node and let's drop this here. And the first bump that I want to add is this noise right over here. So if you go to noise one, I can take this noise texture and let's take the factor and I'm going to drag this over and I'm going to put it into the height value of the bump. And now if I control shift and select the bump node, because we're putting it into the height value, it's converting it to normal data so you can see now it looks very bumpy. So we can now put the normal into the normal of the principled shader and then I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. So you can now see Mars looks all bumpy and noisy, but that's way too strong. So here on the bump strength, I'm going to turn this way down and I'm just going to turn this to a 0.05. So now if I zoom in closely, you can see there's still the bump, but it's very subtle. Now if I control shift and select this mix right here, this is the mix with color B being fully black. And so I want to put this mix into the normal as well to give it some more bump. So I'm going to click on this bump and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and I'm going to drop it here after the first one. So the normal can go through the normal and so we now have this extra height value. So I can take this mix here, this is the one with the black, and I'm going to take the result and put that into the height. And then I can control shift and select the bump to preview it and you can see now it's just adding another very detailed layer of bump. So I can control shift and select the principled shader. Now I also want to put the canyons texture into the normal so the canyons kind of bump back in. So I'm going to click on this bump and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and I can drop it here. And then if I go up here to the canyons I want to take this color and I'm going to drag out a wire and I'm going to stick this here into the other height value. So now if I kind of zoom in here to look at the canyons, if I turn this up you can see there's the canyons popping out. Now I want the canyons to instead look like they're popping back in so I'm going to click on the invert instead and now it looks like they're going back into Mars. And then I want to make this pretty subtle so I'm going to turn the strength to like a .07. So now if I zoom in there you can see it looks like there's just some little cracks here and there. Now I also want to mix in the craters into the bump because I want the craters to look like they're popping out. So I'll click on this bump and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it here and I want to turn off the invert because I don't want that to be inverted. So now if I go here to the craters I can take the lighten and I'm going to drag this over here and I can stick it into the extra height value there. And then if I turn the strength up you can see it taking effect. Now I want these craters to be a bit more subtle so I'm going to turn the strength to like a .2 and that way they're still popping out but they're not quite as strong. And then the last bump that I want to add is the poles. So I'll click on the bump, I'll press shift D to duplicate it and add one more. And then if I go way up here to the poles I want to take the result, I'll drag this way down here and I can stick it into the height value. And then I can drag the strength around and that'll make the poles look like they're popping out. I'm going to leave the strength at a .2 because I think that looks pretty good. So now you can see the surface of Mars looks much more bumpy. So Mars is now looking pretty cool but we still don't have that atmosphere. So I'm now going to be creating the atmosphere and adding that to the Mars surface. So I'll press shift A, I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for the layer weight node. Let's drop this here and then I'm going to control shift and select it to preview it and I actually want to control shift and select it twice so that we are previewing the facing. So with the layer weight node if you're looking at faces on an angle it's going to be lighter. But if you're looking at faces front on then it's going to be darker. And then we can change the blend value and I'm going to turn the blend value to a .1 and that way there is more of the dark area. So wherever the lighter area is that is where the atmosphere is going to be. Now I want to make this more contrasty so I'll press shift A and I'll go to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp and let's put the color ramp after the layer weight. And then I can drag these two tabs together and that's going to make it more contrasty. So I'm actually going to drag the white tab over here but I'm going to drag the black tab over to about here and that way now the atmosphere is much smaller and again where it is lighter that's where you're going to see the atmosphere. Now I also only want to be able to see the atmosphere where the light is shining on the object. And so that is where this empty object comes into play and we added this in the first part of this tutorial. So I'm going to press shift A, I'll go to the search and I'm going to search for the texture coordinate node and let's drag it up here and stick it above the layer weight. And then I want to hold down the control and shift key and I'm going to click on the texture coordinate and I'm going to continue to control shift and select the texture coordinate and I'm going to preview the object. Now right now it's just using the object of the planet but I want to choose a different object. So if I click here on the eyedropper I'm going to click on the empty object and now if I select the light and move the light around by moving the sunlight around it's going to move the empty and so that is going to move the coordinates of the empty because the sun is moving the rotation of the empty. So I'm going to click back on the planet. So we can use this object coordinates to create a gradient and that way the gradient will only be on the side where the planet is getting light. So to create a gradient I'll press shift A and I'll go to the search and I'm going to search for the separate XYZ and let's drop the separate XYZ here and I want the object to be going into the vector and then I can control shift and select the separate XYZ. So I can now control shift and click between these and you can see there are three axes and I want to select the Z one so you can see it's black right here and then it is white down here and that is the same angle as the sunlight. So if I click back on the planet again I want to make this more contrasty so I'll click on the color ramp and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and I'm going to drop it right here and then I can drag the black tab back here and I can drag the white tab over and by dragging this over it'll make that gradient more contrasty. So I'll just leave that right there for now and then I can click and drag the box select these nodes and I'm going to drag them back a little bit behind the principled shader. So this top color ramp is going to be the factor of where you can see the atmosphere and then this color ramp is also going to be where the atmosphere is. So I want to mix them together so I'll press shift A I'll go down here to color and I can add the mix color and let's drop this here and then I want to take the top color and I want to put that into the factor because that's telling it where the atmosphere will show up and then the color ramp is going to be the atmosphere so we'll put the color into color A and then I can control shift and select the mix to preview it. Then here on color B I want to make this fully black and also if I click on the mix here I want to change this to darken so it just adds the dark values. So now if I select the sunlight and rotate the sunlight you can see the atmosphere is adapting with the rotation of the sunlight. So I'm now going to be creating a separate shader which is going to be the atmosphere. So I'll press shift A I can go to the search and I'm going to search for the emission so let's drop the emission right here and then we are going to mix between the emission and the principled so the emission is going to be the atmosphere and then the principled is going to be the Mars surface. So here on the emission I want to take the strength and I want to turn this up to 30 so that it is a bit brighter and then here on the color you can make this whatever color you want for the atmosphere. I'm going to make it a bright blue color and the color that I'll be using for the atmosphere is going to be a hex value of 89 BD D9. So I now want to mix these two together. So I'll press shift A and I'll go to the search and I'll search for the mix shader. Let's drop it here and then I can plug the emission into the bottom shader and then the principled that can go into the top shader and I can control shift and select the mix shader. So I can now drag the factor and you can see we're blending between only using the atmosphere or only using the Mars shader but I only want to be able to see the atmosphere around the edges so I can now take this darken result and I can put that into the factor and that's going to tell it to only show the atmosphere on the edges. Now there is a problem with this and that is that the atmosphere is way too strong. So I can change the color ramp colors to make it less strong. So let's take the first color ramp right down here and I want to make this a gray color. So if I click on the white tab here I can click on the color and I can make this a bit more of a gray color and as I turn it down you can see that it's going to be more subtle and the hex value that I'll be using for this gray color is going to be 78 78 78. So now if you look here on the edges you can see it is a bit more see-through and it's a bit more subtle and then also this color ramp right here if I drag this around it's going to change how much of the atmosphere you can see. So I'm going to drag this kind of to about here and that way you can still see a little bit of the atmosphere right down there and then if I click on the black tab here I'm going to click on this color and I'm going to turn this up and you can see as I turn it up it's also going to make the atmosphere more subtle and the hex value that I'll be using for this light gray color here on the top color ramp is going to be a hex value of E2 E2 E2 and if I select the sunlight and rotate it around you can see that the atmosphere is going to adapt with the light so that is looking super cool. So I can click and drag to box select all these nodes I can press ctrl J to join it into a frame and I'll select the frame and press F2 and I can rename this to atmosphere and there we have it so that is the finished procedural Mars material. So I'm now going to be joining this together into a custom node group and we'll create all the different custom sliders so I'll press ctrl S to save and then I can click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output and then I'm going to press ctrl G and ctrl G will join it together into a node group and you can press the tab key to go in and out of the node group. So I'm going to click on the group input and I'll drag it over here to the material output and then I can zoom in and I can drag this over to make it a bit longer and then I can click here to rename this and I'll just rename this to Mars and then if I click on the Mars group I can hit the tab key to go into the node group. Now if I press the N key that'll open up the side panel and I can click here in group and we have different inputs and outputs and also you can see right over here we have this group input and so we can plug values into this to control it outside of the node group. So I'll drag the group input down and I'm first going to take the scale the mapping and I can put that in here but then I want it to be one single value so I can click on the scale and you can see there's going to be three values so I want to click on the type here and I want to change it to float instead so it's just one value and then here in the default let's change this to one so that is the default scale and then if you hit the tab key to go out of the node group we want to turn the scale back to one. So now I can drag this around and that'll change the scale of the Mars surface. So let's tab to go back into the node group and then if I double click right up here I can rename this to a Mars scale. So I now want to add the poles scale so if you want to when you're creating the custom node group you can click on the group input and you can press shift D to duplicate this and drop it up here and then you can drag these to different places in the setup and then you can drag different values up to it and it might look a little bit cleaner but I'm not going to do that so I'm going to click on the group input and I'll hit X to delete. I'm instead just going to use one group input and I'll drag it around I just find that that's a bit easier. So I'm going to drag this group input right up here behind the poles and then this mapping node this is plugged up to all the textures of the poles so this scale value will change the size of the poles. So let's put the scale into the group input and I can click on this and I'm going to rename this to poles scale and then here on the type I instead want to change this to float so it's using one single value and here in the default value I'm going to turn this to one and then if I hit the tab key to go out of the node group I want to turn the pole scale back to one again. So if I drag the pole scale up you can see it'll make the poles bigger or I can make them smaller. So let's go back into the node group. So I now want to add a value for the visibility of the poles so I'll click on the group input and I'm going to drag this way over here and if you accidentally bring it into a node group you can press alt P to bring it out of the node group. I'm going to bring it down here and this very last lighten if I turn this up it's going to make the poles brighter. So I'll put the factor into the socket here and then if I click on this to rename it I'm going to rename this to poles visibility. So I now want to add the Mars colors so I'll click on this group input and I'll drag it down here and then we can take color A put that in there and then also color B I can put that in there and then also on this mix right here this color B let's put that into the extra socket as well. So then I can click here and drag down so I can see these and I'll rename all of these. So this is going to be Mars color 1 and then Mars color 2 and then Mars color 3. So now if I go outside of the node group with the tab key we have the three main Mars colors. So I'll go back into the node group. So I now want to add the scale of the patches. So I'll click on the group input and I'm going to drag this right back here behind the patches and this noise texture here this is going to change the size of the patches. So let's click and drag and I'm going to stick the scale into the extra socket and I can click on this to rename it and I'm going to rename it to Patches Scale and then I also want to control the patches color. So let's click on the group input and I can drag this back over here over to the mix nodes and this mix right here is going to control the patches color. So let's click on color B and I can drag this into the group input and then I can click on this to rename it and I'm going to rename this to Patches Color. Now I also want to be able to control the visibility of the patches so let's drag the group input right back here behind the patches and we can take this value here. This is going to make it lighter or darker and so that's going to control the visibility. So let's put the value into the extra socket here and then I can click on this to rename it and I'll rename this one to Patches Visibility. So again outside of the node group we can drag this up or down to see the patches more or less. So I will go back into the node group. Now I also want to be able to control the distortion of the patches and here in the patches this noise texture here has a distortion value. So let's put the distortion into the extra socket and then I can rename this one to Patches Distortion. Now I also want to be able to control the amount of atmosphere so on the group input I'm going to drag this way over here and I'm going to stick it behind the layer weight and then I want to take the blend value and I want to put that into the extra socket and then I can click on this to rename it and I'll rename this one to Atmosphere Amount. Then I can click on the group input and I want to press Alt-P to bring it out of the frame and just drag it back. Now I also want to control the strength and color of the atmosphere so you can see we have this strength value so let's drag this into the extra socket and I can drag this down to see all the values and I'm going to rename this one to Atmosphere Strength. And then I also want to control the color so let's put the color into the extra socket here and then I can rename this one to Atmosphere Color. And then I also want to control the craters so I'll click on the group input and I'm going to drag this all the way down here to the craters. So I first want to control the large craters so that is this Voronoi here so let's take the scale and I can put this here into the extra socket and I can click on this to rename it and I'm going to rename this one to Large Craters Scale. Then this bottom Voronoi that is the smaller craters so let's put the scale put that into the extra socket and then this one I can rename to Small Craters Scale. And then I want to drag it right up here and I'm going to stick it right here next to the mix nodes and I want to add the craters color so right here on this mix this color here that's going to be the craters color. So let's put color B into the extra socket here and then I can rename this to Craters Color. Then I want to control a canyon scale so I'll bring the group input right back here behind the canyons and then we have this scale value here on the Voronoi. So I can take the scale put that into the extra socket and I can rename this to Canyon Scale. And then the canyons color if I go right over here we have this mix here and that is the black color so let's take color B and I can drag this over here and I'll put it into the extra socket and then I'll rename this one to Canyons Color. And then I want to control the roughness and the bump strengths. So let's click on the group input and I can drag this right over here just stick it there so right here this roughness I can put the roughness right in there and that's already renamed to Roughness. So I now want to plug up all the bumps so I'm actually just going to drag the group input right down here so it's a bit easier to plug into the group input. So this first one here is the overall noise so let's plug the strength into the group input and I can rename this to Noise Bump Strength. Then the second one here is just the surface so let's take the strength I'll put that in there and then I can rename this to Surface Bump Strength. And then the next one here this one is the canyons so the strength put that right in there and I can rename this to Canyons Bump Strength. And then the next one here this is the bump of the craters so I'll put this one right in here and then this one I can rename to Craters Bump Strength. And finally the very last one this is the poles bump strength. So I'll put this here into the extra socket and I can drag down and I can rename this one to Poles Bump Strength. And I can click on the group input and I'll just drag it way back here. Alright so I can now hit the tab key to go out of the node group and I can zoom in and here is the final material. And then of course you can select the sunlight and you can move the sunlight around and that's going to change the sun and the atmosphere. So before I finish up the tutorial I'm going to render out the image and then I'll do a little bit of compositing which will make the final image look a bit nicer. So if I click here on the render properties I'm going to open up the sampling and I'm going to set the samples to 100. And also right over here on the output properties I have this set to 1920 by 1920 on the resolution so that the image is a square and I also have the resolution to 200 so it's a very high quality but of course this will take longer to render. So I'll press control S to save and then I can click render and click on render image or the shortcut key is control F12. And the image has finished rendering. So I'm now going to click right over here on the compositing tab and I can click on use nodes to use the compositing nodes and I can also drag the timeline down. So because we turned on the node wrangler add-on I can hold down the control and shift key and then select the render layers and that's going to add this viewer node and so we can preview Mars in the background. I can also press V to zoom out the background and Alt V to zoom the background in. And also make sure you have the backdrop button turned on and also the use nodes. So I now just want one wire that I can add all the compositing nodes so I'll hold down the shift key and then right click and drag over the wires and then let go and that is going to add a reroute so the viewer and composite is plugged up and we can now add all of the compositing nodes. So I'll press shift A, I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to start by adding the RGB curves. Let's drop this here and then I can click right here to add a dot and I'll drag this up to make it brighter and then I'll click here to add another dot to turn this down. And this way it's going to make it more contrasty so the lighters will be lighter and the darkers will be darker. I can also press shift A and I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for the filter and I'll drop this here and then if I click on the type here I want to change this to box sharpen instead. And then here on the factor I'm just going to turn this to like a 0.1 and that's just going to add a tiny little bit of sharpness to the planet and I think it looks a bit nicer. I also want to add a tiny little bit of glare to the atmosphere so I'll press shift A and I'll go to the search, I'll search for the glare node and I can drop this right here and then on the streaks I want to change this to the fog glow instead and I'll leave the quality at medium. And then it is a bit hard to see so I can turn the threshold down so you can see it a bit better. So for my scene turning the threshold down to a 0.2 looks pretty good but that is also going to depend on the brightness of the atmosphere. So there's now just a very subtle glow on the edge of the planet. And I can also turn the size up to 9 so it's just a little bit bigger. I also want to add a lens distortion to make it look more sci-fi so I'll press shift A, I'll go to the search and I'm going to search for the lens distortion and I'll drop this right down here and then on the dispersion I'm going to turn this to a 0.01 and it is going to be very subtle but now if you look here on the edges you can see the stars are being distorted just a little bit and it looks a bit more sci-fi. And then finally at the very end here I also want to add a denoise node just to denoise the image. So I'll press shift A, I'll go to the search, I'll search for the denoise node and I actually want to drop it here before the other nodes so I'll drop it here and then the accurate, I'm just going to change this to fast because it goes faster and I find it doesn't really affect the quality. But you can see I added the denoise node last because it is taking a while to composite with that denoise. And it just finished compositing so there is the final image. So to save this image you can select the viewer node and then you can press the N key and that's going to open up the side panel. And you can click here on node and make sure you have the viewer node selected and click on node and you can then click on the save this image button. And I'll just save this as Mars and I'm going to save it as a PNG image. And I'll just click on save as image. So I hope you enjoyed this two part tutorial and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69_fydOxsE,Procedural Dark Leather Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural dark leather material, which is part of a series on procedural leather materials available on their YouTube channel. The tutorial covers the node setup for the material, including scale adjustments, color settings, detail levels, roughness, and bump strengths. The instructor also shows how to organize these components into a custom node group for easier manipulation. Additionally, the video includes a brief overview of setting up a Blender scene with cloth physics and lighting for realistic rendering. Links to purchase the materials and access more tutorials are provided in the video description.","In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural dark leather material. And this dark leather material is one of three procedural leather materials that I recently created, and I have three separate tutorials on my YouTube channel on how to create these materials. So if you'd like to check out the other tutorials and learn how to create these other procedural leather materials, I'll have the links in the description. But in this video, I'm going to show you how to create this dark leather material. So here is the node setup, and after we create the procedural nodes, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the material, then we also just have the noise scale, and then we also just have the leather scale. And then we also have some different colors here, so we have color 1, and then color 2. Then we have leather detail 1, so I can turn this down if I want less detail, or I can turn this up if I want lots of detail. And then we also have leather detail 2, and this also kind of changes the variation of the leather. And then we also have the roughness of the leather, and then finally we have three bump strengths. So we have the damage bump strength, so I can turn this up if I want to look really old and damaged. We also have just a noise bump strength, and then we also have the leather bump strength. If you'd like to help support me and this channel and purchase these materials, then you can get them on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description. And if you'd like to purchase all of my procedural materials, then definitely check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack with the links in the description. And you can also purchase my procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase packs of 10 materials. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So real quick, I'm going to show you my scene setup if you want to set up the Blender file the same way that I have. But if you want to skip this part, then you can check out the timestamps in the video description and just jump to the procedural material. So what I did is pressed Shift-A, I went here to Mesh, and I added in Icosphere. Then I pressed Shift-A, I went here to Mesh, and I added a plane. And this plane is going to be the cloth object. So I'm going to move the plane up on the Z axis. Then I'm going to hit S to scale, and I'm going to type in 3 and then Enter so that the plane is bigger. Then I'm going to go into Edit Mode with the Tab key, and I'm going to use the Object Context menu, and I'm going to subdivide the mesh. Then right behind me, right after you subdivide the mesh, there's that little subdivide setting there, and you can turn up the number of cuts. So I'm going to turn this up to 60, and this way when we add cloth physics to the mesh, it'll have more geometry to work with. And I can go back to Object Mode. So then to add the physics, you can click right over here on the Physics properties. And on the plane here, we want to add the cloth physics. Now I'm going to scroll right down here. I'm going to leave all the settings at the default, except that I'm going to open up the collisions, and I'm going to turn on the self-collision. And then also I'm going to click on the sphere here, and over here on the physics properties, I'm going to turn on the collision. And this way, because it has the collision, the cloth is going to interact with the sphere. So you can now press the spacebar to play the timeline, and you can let the cloth simulate. And right about there is pretty good. So I now want to apply the physics, so I'm going to click on the cloth object, and we can click right over here on the modifier properties, and you can see it's been added as a modifier. So you can click on the arrow here and then click on Apply. And then I also want to use the object context menu to shade the object smooth. And then also here, if you select the sphere, I'm going to click on this and just apply it as well, so it doesn't have the collision. Now when modeling to the real-life scale in Blender, the default primitive objects are a little bit higher than an average human. So I'm going to select both of the objects, and then I'm going to scale them. And after I hit S to scale, I'm going to type in 0.15. So just 0.15, and that way it is much smaller. And I'm going to bring this down into the center. And then I want to press Ctrl-A, and I want to apply the scale of both of these objects, so this is now the object's new default size. Now to make the cloth look a little bit better, I'm going to select the cloth, and over here on the modifiers, I'm going to click on Add Modifier, and I'm going to add the Subdivision Surface modifier. And then here on the Levels Viewport and Render, I'm going to turn this up to 2, and that way the cloth looks quite a bit nicer. I'm also going to click on Add Modifier, and here under Generate, I'm going to add the Solidify modifier, and that way the cloth has a little bit of thickness, but then I'll just turn the Thickness value down so that it is a very small thickness value. And then I also just added a camera, and I pointed the camera at the object. And if you select the camera, you can go over here to the Object Data Properties, and I turned the Focal Length up to 100, and that way it just kind of zooms the camera in, and it makes things look a bit more flat, and I do like that a bit better. Now for the lighting, I added these two area lights right here. So this first area light is over on this side, and right over here, if you go to the Object Data Properties, I turn the Power to 150. And then this light over here, I turn the Shape to Rectangle, and I turn the Power to 50. And I put this a little bit behind the leather object, and this way it's going to give a little bit of a rim light behind the object. Now to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections, right over here on the World Properties, I added in the Reading Room HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Link's in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So once you've downloaded the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to Color on the World Properties, and you can choose Environment Texture, and then just click on the Open button, and you can open up the downloaded HDRI. Now if you want to make the background transparent, so that you can't see the world in the background, you can go right up here to the Render Properties, and you can open up the Film tab right here. And you can checkmark the Transparent button, and that way you can't see the HDRI in the background. And then also if you open up the Color Management right here, I set the View Transform to Filmic, and I set the Look to Very High Contrast. And this will make the final image look more contrasty and saturated. So I'm in the Shading workspace, and I've put the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the Rendered mode, so I can preview the material. And then right over here, I have the Shader Editor to create the procedural setup. And then before we start, I'm also going to be using the NodeWrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the NodeWrangler enabled, you can click on Edit, and you can go to the Preferences, and then over there on the Add-ons tab, just search for NodeWrangler, and you can checkmark the NodeWrangler add-on. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So let's click here on the New button to add a new material. And then I can just rename this material to Dark Leather. So let's now create the base texture of the material. So I will press Shift-A, and I'll go to the Search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's stick the noise texture here. And then make sure you're in Rendered mode by holding down the Z button and moving your mouse up into the Rendered view, so you can see the material. And I'm going to hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and select the noise texture, so we can preview it on the object. And then also with the noise texture selected, I'm going to press Ctrl-T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And let's use the object coordinates, because the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the object more evenly. So let's put the object into the vector of the mapping, and the mapping can go into the noise texture. So let's now change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale up to 18, and then I do want it to be very detailed, so let's turn the detail to the max of 15. And let's also turn the roughness to a 0.55, so there's a bit more roughness. Now I want to make this noise texture look more interesting, and so I'm actually going to put another noise texture here in between the mapping and the noise texture. And because it's going to be going through the vector, it's going to distort the placement of the noise. So let's select the noise texture, and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it, and let's stick it here before the first one. So now you can see this noise texture is being distorted by another noise texture. And then let's change the settings of the second noise texture. So I'm going to turn the scale to 80, so that it is much smaller. And then I want to keep the detail at 15, so it's very detailed. And I do just want to add a little bit more roughness, so let's turn the roughness to a 0.58. Now this texture is being distorted a lot, and I don't want it to be quite that distorted. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the mix node. Let's drop the mix up here, and I want to click on the float and change it to color instead. I want to bring this back and bring the noise texture back, so I have a bit more space. And I want to put this mix in between both of the noise textures. So we can use this mix to mix two colors together. Let's want to bring the noise texture down, and I want to put the noise texture color into value B. But then I want to take the original mapping, which isn't distorted at all, and I want to put that into color A. So now we're mixing between the distorted noise and the mapping, which is not distorted. And so now we can drag the factor, and if we turn the factor to 0, the noise is not being distorted at all. But then as we turn it up, it's going to use more and more of color B, which is the distorted noise texture. Now you can see when I drag this around, it's kind of moving the texture around. So let's click on the mix here, and I can change the type to linear light. This way, if I drag it around, it's still going to distort the noise texture, but it won't move it around quite as much. Now I want it to be only distorted by a very small amount. So I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.07. So now we have this really cool texture here, where there's some noisy areas which are kind of darker, and then there's some other noisy areas which are quite lighter. I'm going to drag this noise texture up here, and then kind of compact these nodes by bringing them in together. Now before we create the colors for the leather, I do want to make this more contrasty, because it is all pretty gray. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and let's put the color ramp here after the noise texture. And then I can click on these tabs, and I can drag them together, and you can see as I drag them closer and closer, it's going to make it more contrasty. So I want to make the black tab kind of to about here, so you can kind of see that a bit better, and then the white tab, I'll bring to about there. So now we can make the colors for the leather. So I'll press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for another mix node. Let's drop this up here, and I want to use color values, so let's change the float to color instead. And then I can drop the mix here after the color ramp. Now I want to create two different colors, so we can actually put this color ramp color into the factor. And so now, this is basically acting as a mask to tell it where it's going to be color A, and where it's going to be color B. So we can now change the colors for A and B. So here on color A, I want to make this kind of an orangey color, but then I want to make it darker, so it's a dark, saturated brown color. And this color here, I want to make it very dark and make it brown, so it's a very, very dark brown. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, that on this mix here, you can go to color A, and here on the hex value, you can punch in a hex value of 3C1906. So it's a very dark brown. And then here on B, I just want this to be fully black, so you can drag this down to 0, or you can punch in a hex value of 6 zeros. So we can now bring the principled shader over, and let's take the mix result, and I can put that into the base color. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now, this leather is pretty shiny, and so I do want to make it a bit more rough. So what I'm going to do is take this noise texture factor, and let's put that into the roughness, so that some parts are more shiny, whereas other parts are more rough. But then I want to have more control over this, so let's select this color ramp, and I can press Shift-D to duplicate it, and I want to drop it here after the noise texture, but before the roughness. And then with this color ramp selected, I can hit the backspace, and that's going to reset the color ramp. So if I make the values lighter, that is going to make it more rough. So if I click on the black tab here, I can make this much lighter, and now you can see the leather is a bit more rough. And if you want to use the same roughness value that I'm using, then here on the color ramp on this gray color, I'm going to use a hex value of 7F, 7F, 7F. Now, later on when we create the custom node group, I do want to be able to control the roughness values. So what I can do is press Shift-A, and I can go here to the search, and I can search for the hue saturation value, and I want to put this after the color ramp, before the roughness. We now have this value here, and this value is going to make the texture lighter or darker, and so this will change the roughness of the material. So we can use that value later in the custom node group. So this is starting to look like leather, but it doesn't have any bump on the surface. So I'm now going to create a leather texture that we can put into the normal to give it some bump. So I'll press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I can search for the Voronoi texture. Let's drop the Voronoi down here underneath this noise, and then I can Control-Shift and select it to preview it. So we can turn the scale way up, and then we can put that into the normal to give a nice little texture of leather. So I'm going to turn the Voronoi scale to 1000, so that it is very small. Now if I zoom in really, really close, you can see the dots are pretty smooth, and they aren't very rough or bumpy. So what I'm going to do is select this linear light right here, this mix, and I'm going to press Control-Shift-D. So Control-Shift-D is going to duplicate the node, but it'll keep the wires plugged up. And so it's the same setup as this noise texture in the mapping, and that's being mixed together here into the linear light. And so we can now take this mix here, the linear light, and we can put the result into the vector of the Voronoi. And so it's going to do the same thing with this noise texture, it's going to distort the placement of the Voronoi. So now you can see those dots are very noisy. Now I want to make it very, very subtle, because I basically want some dots, but I want the dots to just have a tiny bit of noise around them. So I'm going to turn this factor to a 0.004, just a 0.004. And now you can clearly see that there's still dots there, but they are kind of noisy. So I can now take the Voronoi texture distance, and let's put that into the normal of the principled shader. And then I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now we need to convert this black and white data into normal data that the shader can use. So I'll press Shift-A, and let's go to the search. And I can search for the bump node, and let's put the bump node here after the Voronoi before the normal. And then we actually want to take the Voronoi distance, and we want to put that into the height value of the bump. And now you can see it's converting it to normal data. And then I want the little dots to be popping out instead of going back in. So let's hit the invert button, and now they look like they're popping out. Now this bump map is way too strong, so I want to turn the strength down to make it less strong. And I'm going to use a strength value of 0.17. So now we have a nice little texture over the leather. Now I also want to add a little bit of noise all over the entire material. So let's take this bump, and I can press Shift-D to duplicate it, and I can drop it down here. And then I want to turn off the invert because I don't want to use the invert on this one. So let's take the normal, and I can put that into the normal of the bump. And this way we can mix two bump maps together. So we now have this height value that we can add data into. So let's take the noise texture factor, and I'm going to put that into the height of this bump here. But I do want it to be pretty subtle, so I'm going to turn the strength value to a 0.13. But now there's just a little bit of noise all over the entire material. And then I also want to add one more layer of bump, but this last layer of bump is just going to be these darker areas. So if I Control-Shift and select the noise texture, we're going to use this, and we're going to make it more contrasty, and then put it into the bump. So I'm going to just box select some of these nodes here, and I'm going to drag them over just so I have a little bit more space. So I can now click on this bump node, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it. Let's put it here, and the normal can go into the normal. Now we're going to plug up the same texture, so the noise texture factor is going to go into the height value of this last bump. And then let's Control-Shift and select this bump to preview it. So right now there's noise all over the place, but I want to make it more contrasty so you can only see the noise on those darker areas. So I can just select any of the color ramps, and I can press Shift-D to duplicate it, and let's drop it here between the noise texture and the third bump. So just drop it right there. And then just select this color ramp, and you can hit the backspace to reset it. So we can now click on this white tab, and we can drag it over, and that's going to make it more contrasty. If I Control-Shift and select the color ramp, you can see what it's doing. So it's making things more and more white, so now there's just a little bit of gray areas here and there. So let's Control-Shift and select the bump node, and I can actually turn the bump strength up so you can see it stronger. So now if I drag this white tab, you can see there's only going to be noise in some places here and there. And right here on this bump strength, I want to turn this to a .25. I think that is a pretty good strength, not too strong. And I'm going to drag this white tab right about here, about in the center, and that is looking pretty good. So now there's some areas where there's more bump. So I can Control-Shift and select the final material. So now let's join this together into a custom node group. So I can click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output. And then I can press Control-G. Control-G will join it together into a node group, and you can press the Tab key with the node group selected to go in and out of the node group. So let's drag the node group over here, and I can make it a bit bigger. And then right here on the material name, I want to click on this and press Control-C to copy the name. Let's click here and press Control-V to paste the name. So now it is called Dark Leather. And then if I Tab to go into the node group, I can press the N key. That'll open up the side panel here, and we have the inputs and the outputs. And here on the BSDF, I want to click on this, and I'm going to rename it to Shader because I like that a bit better. So now it's called Shader. So back into the node group, we can go over here to the group input, and we can add all the custom values that we want to control. So let's bring this down here, and I first want to put the scale into the group input because this mapping is plugged up to all the textures. And so the scale is going to change the size of the entire material. So let's put the scale into the group input. And then if I click here on the inputs, I want to make this one single value. I don't want it to be three values. I just want it to be one. So here on the scale, I can click on the type here, and I want to change it to float instead so it is just one single value. And then here on the default value, I want to turn this to one. And then right here on the minimum value, I want to turn this to zero. And that way, it can't be scaled in the negative values. It can only be scaled up. And then if I go outside of the node group, I need to turn the scale back to one so that we can actually see the texture. So let's go back into the node group. Now, I also want to be able to control just the scale of the noise and just the scale of the leather texture. So here on this noise texture, we have this scale value. So we can take the scale, we can put that into the extra socket, and then we can click on this to rename it. And I'm going to rename it to noise scale. And also right here on the minimum value, I'm just going to turn this to zero so that we can't scale it down into negative values. And then I want to also be able to control the leather scale. And so this 4-0 texture here, this is controlling the scale of that detailed leather texture. So let's take the scale and put that in here. And then if I double click on this to rename it, I'm going to rename it to leather scale. Now, if we go outside of the node group, this leather scale is very big. It's at a thousand. So we have to drag it around quite a lot to see it taking effect. So I'm going to go back into the node group, and I'm going to make this value more sensitive. So I'll press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the math node. And let's put the math node here between the leather scale and the Voronoi. And I want to put this leather scale into the bottom socket of the math node. And then because I want to make it more sensitive, we want to multiply the number values. So here on the add, let's change this to multiply. Then here on this value, I can turn this up. And I'm going to turn it up to like 20. So now the leather texture is way too big. So if I hit the Tab key to go out of the node group, here this leather scale, I just want to turn it down to like 35. And now if I zoom in there, you can see it again. So that is a better size. But now if I drag this around, because we multiplied the values, it's going to be much more sensitive. Now if I go back into the node group here on the leather scale, I want the default to be 35 because I like that size. And then also here on the minimum value, I'll just turn this to zero. So now we can add the different custom colors. So I'm going to click on this group input. And let's press Shift-D to duplicate it. And I can drag it over here. And let's put it here above this color ramp. So then we can put color A right in here. And then also we can take color B and put that into the extra socket. And then we can rename these. So I'm just going to rename them color 1 and color 2. So now if I go outside of the node group, we have the different colors. Now I also want to be able to control some of the settings of the textures. So let's click on one of the group inputs. I can press Shift-D to duplicate it. And let's drop it here above the mapping. So I want to be able to control the detail of the textures. So right here on this first noise texture, we have this roughness value here. And I can turn this up and down to change the look of the leather. So let's take this roughness from this noise texture, put it in here. And then I want to rename this. And I'm going to rename this to leather detail 1. Now right here on this other noise texture, we also have this detail value. And I can drag this up and down. And that's going to change how the leather looks. And I like being able to control that value as well. So let's take the detail, put that in there. And then I can rename this to leather detail 2. So let's click on this group input here. I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it. Let's drag it down here. And then this hue saturation value is going into the roughness. And the value is going to make it lighter or darker, which will make it more rough or more shiny. So let's put the value into the extra socket here. And then I can rename this to roughness here on the side panel. And then I want to add the three layers of bump. So this first one here is going to make the leather look a bit more damaged or less damaged. So let's take the strength. And I can put that here into the extra socket. And then I can click on this to rename it. And I'm going to rename this one to damage bump strength. Now this second one here, this is just some overall noise. So let's put the strength into the extra socket. And then I can rename this to noise bump strength. And then this last one here is controlling the leather texture. So let's put the strength here into the extra socket. And I can rename this to leather bump strength. So now that we're finished, to make the node setup look a bit nicer, I can click on the group inputs. And I can press Control-H. So Control-H is going to collapse the nodes. So Control-H, drag that down, Control-H. And then this one here, Control-H. And so this way, it's only going to show the inputs that are plugged into it. So I can tab to go out of the node group. And here is the dark leather material. So we have the overall scale that changed the entire size of the material. Then we just have the noise scale. And then we also just have the leather scale. Then we have the two different colors. So we have color 1 and color 2. And then we also have these different detail levels. So leather detail 1. And then also leather detail 2. And this is going to change how the leather looks. Then we also have the roughness. And then finally, we have three layers of bump. So we can change the damage bump strength. We can also change the noise bump strength. And we can also change the leather bump strength. And that is it. So that is the dark leather material. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In9V4-ih16o,Procedural Generic Leather Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a generic procedural leather material. The tutorial is part of a series featuring three different leather materials, with links to the other videos provided in the description. The creator explains the node setup in detail, including how to manipulate the scale, color, noise, roughness, and bump strength to achieve the desired leather texture. Additionally, the video covers how to create a custom node group for easy adjustments and offers options to purchase the materials and others through Gumroad or Patreon. The tutorial also highlights supporting resources such as an ultimate Blender procedural material pack and a YouTube playlist for further learning.","In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this generic leather material in Blender. Now this leather material is one of three procedural leather materials which I've recently created, and I'm posting three separate tutorials on my YouTube channel on how to create these leather materials. So if you'd like to check out the other tutorials to learn how to create these other leather materials, I'll have the links in the description. But in this video, I'm going to show you how to create the generic leather. So here is the node setup, and after we create the procedural nodes, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group. So we have the overall scale to change the size of the material, and then we also have color 1 and also color 2. Then we have just the leather scale, and then we also have just the noise scale to change those specific textures. And then we also have this noise color just to change some of the noise on the leather. Then we also have the roughness of the material, and then finally we have three bump strengths, so the leather bump strength, and the noise bump strength, and also the folds bump strength. If you'd like to help support me and this channel and purchase these materials, then you can get them on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description.

So real quick, I'm going to show you my scene setup if you want to set up the blender file the same way that I have. But if you want to skip this part, then you can check out the timestamps in the video description, and just jump to the procedural material. So what I did is press Shift-A, I went here to Mesh, and I added an icosphere. Then I pressed Shift-A, I went here to Mesh, and I added a plane, and this plane is going to be the cloth object. So I'm going to move the plane up on the Z axis. Then I'm going to hit S to scale, and I'm going to type in 3 and then Enter so that the plane is bigger. Then I'm going to go into edit mode with the Tab key, and I'm going to use the object context menu, and I'm going to subdivide the mesh. Then right behind me, right after you subdivide the mesh, there's that little subdivide setting there, and you can turn up the number of cuts. So I'm going to turn this up to 60. And this way, when we add cloth physics to the mesh, it'll have more geometry to work with. And I can go back to object mode. So then to add the physics, you can click right over here on the physics properties. And on the plane here, we want to add the cloth physics. Now I'm going to scroll right down here. I'm going to leave all the settings at the default, except that I'm going to open up the collisions, and I'm going to turn on the self collision. And then also I'm going to click on the sphere here, and over here on the physics properties, I'm going to turn on the collision. And this way, because it has the collision, the cloth is going to interact with the sphere. So you can now press the spacebar to play the timeline, and you can let the cloth simulate. And right about there is pretty good. So I now want to apply the physics. So I'm going to click on the cloth object, and we can click right over here on the modifier properties. And you can see it's been added as a modifier. So you can click on the arrow here, and then click on apply. And then I also want to use the object context menu to shade the object smooth. And then also here, if you select the sphere, I'm going to click on this and just apply it as well, so it doesn't have the collision. Now, when modeling to the real life scale and blender, the default primitive objects are a little bit higher than an average human. So I'm going to select both of the objects, and then I'm going to scale them. And after I hit S to scale, I'm going to type in 0.15. So just 0.15. And that way, it is much smaller. And I'm going to bring this down into the center. And then I want to press Ctrl A, and I want to apply the scale of both of these objects. So this is now the object's new default size. Now to make the cloth look a little bit better, I'm going to select the cloth. And over here on the modifiers, I'm going to click on add modifier, and I'm going to add the subdivision surface modifier. And then here on the levels viewport and render, I'm going to turn this up to two. And that way, the cloth looks quite a bit nicer. I'm also going to click on add modifier. And here under generate, I'm going to add the solidify modifier. And that way, the cloth has a little bit of thickness, but then I'll just turn the thickness value down so that it is a very small thickness value. And then I also just added a camera, and I pointed the camera at the object. And if you select the camera, you can go over here to the object data properties, and I turned the focal length up to 100. And that way, it just kind of zooms the camera in, and it makes things look a bit more flat. And I do like that a bit better. Now for the lighting, I added these two area lights right here. So this first area light is over on this side. And right over here, if you go to the object data properties, I turn the power to 150. And then this light over here, I turn the shape to rectangle, and I turn the power to 50. And I put this a little bit behind the leather object. And this way, it's going to give a little bit of a rim light behind the object. Now to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections right over here on the world properties, I added in the reading room HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, links in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1k HDR version. So once you've downloaded the HDRI, you can click on the yellow dot here next to color on the world properties, and you can choose environment texture. And then just click on the open button, and you can open up the downloaded HDRI. Now if you want to make the background transparent so that you can't see the world in the background, you can go right up here to the render properties, and you can open up the film tab right here. And you can check mark the transparent button, and that way you can't see the HDRI in the background. And then also if you open up the color management right here, I set the view transform to filmic, and I set the look to very high contrast. And this will make the final image look more contrasty and saturated. So I'm in the shading workspace, and I've put the 3D viewport right over here. And I'm in the rendered mode, so I can preview the material. And then right over here, I have the shader editor to create the procedural setup. And then before we start, I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on edit, and you can go to the preferences. And then over there on the add-ons tab, just search for Node Wrangler, and you can check mark the Node Wrangler add-on. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So I'm going to click on the new button here to add a new material, and I will rename the material. And I'm going to call this material generic leather. So let's start by creating the base leather texture. So I'll press Shift-A. I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture. Let's drop the Voronoi here. And then to preview the Voronoi texture, we can hold down the Control and Shift key, and then select the Voronoi texture. That's using the feature of the Node Wrangler, and it will preview the node on the object. And make sure you're in the rendered mode here in the viewport, so you can preview the texture. Now also with the Voronoi texture selected, I'm going to press Control-T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I want to use the object coordinates, because the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. So let's put the object into the mapping here, and then the mapping can go into the Voronoi. And then I want to turn the scale down, so we can see the texture better. So right now the Voronoi texture is a bunch of little dots, but I want to make this look more like a leather texture, which has all of those little cracks. So I'm going to click on the F1 here, and I'm going to change this to distance to edge. So now you can see that we have these little white areas, and then there's all these little black cracks. And then I want to make the scale very, very big, because the texture should be very small. And I'm actually going to change this to a value of 530 here on the scale. So now we have this very detailed texture for the leather. Now if you zoom in very closely, you can see that these lines are very smooth, and they aren't very random, and they aren't very rough. And so I want to add a noise texture here between the mapping and the Voronoi, to distort the placement of the Voronoi texture, and add some noise to those lines. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And let's put the noise texture between the mapping and the Voronoi. And the vector is controlling how the Voronoi texture is going to be placed on the object, and so the noise texture, because it's going through the vector, it's distorting the placement of the Voronoi. So now you can see it looks kind of warped and random. Let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale way up to 40, so that it is much smaller. And then I also want to turn the detail up to the max of 15, so it's very detailed. And then I do want to turn the roughness up a little bit, so I'm going to turn the roughness to 0.6. And then I do want to add a little bit of distortion to make it look a bit distorted and wobbly, so I'm going to turn the distortion to a value of 0.2. Now the noise texture is distorting the Voronoi way too much, it kind of just looks like some white noise, and it's extremely noisy. So I want the Voronoi texture to have less of an effect on the Voronoi. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the mix node. Let's drop the mix node right up here, and then I want to click on the float, and I want to change it to color instead. Then I want to drop the mix node in between the noise texture and the Voronoi. And I'll drag this over so I have a bit more space. So I want the noise texture color to be going into color B, and then I want the original mapping vector to be going into color A. So now if I turn the factor all the way to 0, you can see the texture isn't distorted at all, but then as I drag it up, it's going to be more and more distorted, because it's using more of color B, which is the noise texture. Now you can see that when I drag this around, the texture is being moved around a lot, so to make it so it's not moving around so much, you can click on the mix here, and you can change it to linear light instead. And now you can see it's not being moved around quite as much, but it's still being distorted. Now I want it to be very, very subtle, so on the factor here, I'm going to turn this to a 0.005. So this way, you can still clearly see the Voronoi texture, but the edges are very noisy and random, and that's going to look much better. So now let's create the colors for the leather texture. So I'll press shift A, let's go to the search, and I can search for another mix node. Let's drop it here, and I want to click on the float, and I want to change it to color instead. And then we can drop the mix here after the Voronoi. Now I want the Voronoi texture to be going into the factor, and the factor is determining where it'll be color A and where it'll be color B. And so this Voronoi texture is black and white, and so the black and white values will tell it where it's A and where it's B, because the distance is going into the factor. So for color A, I want to make this kind of like an orangey-red color, and then I want to make it a bit darker. And then here on color B, I want to make this an even darker color, kind of more red and more saturated, and we'll make it darker. And if you want to use the exact same colors that I'm using, then here on color A, if you go to the hex value, you can punch in 6F3A1F. And then here on color B, if you click over here, go to the hex value, you can punch in 481F11. So those are the exact colors that I'm using. Now if you zoom in closely, you can see it is pretty subtle, and it's not very contrasty or sharp. So in between the Voronoi texture and the mix, I'm going to add a color ramp to make it more contrasty. So let's press shift A, I can go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and let's put it here after the Voronoi texture. So I can now drag these around, and you can see as I drag the tabs around, it's going to make those white and black values lighter and darker. Now I actually want to flip the values, so let's drag the black tab over here, and then I want to drag the white tab over here. And I'll drag the white tab pretty close to the end, but not all the way. And the black tab, I'm also going to drag it over, and I'll bring it to about here. So now you can see it is much more contrasty, so there are these very clear areas where it is the lighter brown, and then the cracks have the darker brown. You can drag this around depending on the contrast that you want. So this is definitely looking like a leather texture, but I also want to just add some noise all over the material to make a few parts look a bit different, make some parts look lighter and other parts darker. So we actually have this noise texture right here, we already have this noise texture, and so we can plug this into the color to add a bit of noise. So what I'm first going to do is click on this mix, and I'll press shift to duplicate it, and let's drop it down here. So I now want to take this mix result, and I want to put that into color A, and then I want to control shift and select the mix to preview it. So then we can add the noise into the factor, and that way color B can be the noise. So right over here, let's take the noise texture factor, and let's drag this over, and I want to stick it into the factor of the mix. So now you can see there's a bit of noise here and there, and it just makes it look a bit more organic and natural. And here on color B, you can change this, and this is going to change the color of that noise. So for this color here, color B, I'm going to make this kind of like a lighter brown. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, then here on the hex value, you can punch in 744327. So now you can see some parts are a little bit lighter because we have that noise mixing in with the color. So I can now take the mix result, and let's put that into the base color, and then I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now there is just one more thing that I want to do to the base color, and that is that I want to make the noise a little bit more contrasty. So let's click on this color ramp, and I can press shift D to duplicate it, and we want to drop it here on the wire between the noise texture and the mix. So drop it right here. And then I can hit the backspace, and the backspace is going to reset the color ramp. So I can now drag these tabs together, and that's going to make it more contrasty. If I control shift and select the color ramp, you can see if I drag this out, it'll make it more black or more white. So if I control shift and select this mix right here, now if I drag these together, you can see that noise is definitely more contrasty. So I'm going to drag the black tab to about here, and then also the white tab, I'll kind of drag it to about there. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader, and that definitely looks better. Now I want to make it a bit more rough, so we can turn this roughness value up, but I want to have some parts a little bit more rough and other parts a little bit more shiny. So I'm going to drag the principled shader back, and then I want to take this mix result, and I want to put this into the roughness. So this way, the lighter and darker values are determining if it's going to be more shiny or more rough. But I want to control this better, because it's super shiny right now. So I'm just going to click on this color ramp right here, and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it, and we're going to drop it here between the mix and the roughness. And then I can hit the backspace to reset the color ramp. So if the values are lighter, then it's going to be more rough. So if I click on this black tab here and click on the color, I can make this brighter, and you can see now it's going to be more rough because it is lighter. And if you want to use the same exact gray color that I'm using, then over here on the hex, you can punch in bf bf bf. Now when we join this together into a custom node group, I do want to be able to control the roughness. And to control the roughness, we just need to make the texture lighter or darker. So I'll press shift a, let's go to the search, and I can search for the hue saturation value. And let's put this in between the color ramp and the roughness. So this value here will make the colors lighter or darker. So when I drag this around, it's changing the roughness of the material. So we'll use that later in the custom node group. Now this leather material is very smooth, so I want to put some data here into the normal to give it some bump and make it look more realistic. So what I first want to do is make the leather look like it's a little bit folded or a little bit lumpy. So what I'm going to do is press shift a, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And let's put it here underneath the first noise texture. And then this mapping node is going to control the entire scale of the material. So I want to put the vector into the vector of the noise texture, and that way this noise texture will also be using the object coordinates. And then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So we're going to use this texture to make the leather look like it has a little bit of folds and make it look slightly bumpy. So let's change the settings of the noise texture. So I'm going to turn the scale to a value of 20. And then I want to leave the detail at 2. I don't really want to turn the detail up. I want to leave the detail at 2 because if it's too detailed, it'll just look very noisy. But I want this texture to look like folds or make it look like the leather is kind of moving around just slightly. Although on the roughness here, I will turn this to a 0.52 just so it has a tiny bit more roughness. So I can now take the factor from this noise texture. I'm going to bring out a wire and I'm going to drag this all the way over here. And I want to put this into the normal of the principled shader. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now there's some weird shading issues, and that's because we need to convert the black and white data from the noise texture into normal data that the principled shader can use. So let's press shift A and go here to the search. And I'm going to add the bump node. And we want to put the bump node in the wire here before it goes into the normal. And then we actually want to put the wire here from the noise texture into the height value of the bump. And that way it's going to convert it to normal data. So now you can see the leather looks all bumpy. Now that is way too strong, and I want to make it very subtle. So let's turn the strength to a 0.04. But you can still kind of see here, it looks just slightly folded. Now I also want to just add a little bit of noise all over the bump. So what I can do is click on this bump node, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it. And let's drop it down here. So we can put the normal into the normal of this bump. And so now we have another height value that we can add data into. So we can mix multiple bump maps together. So this top noise texture up here, let's take the factor. We're going to drag this all the way over, and we're going to put it into the height value of this second bump. And then we can turn the strength up of the bump, so you can actually see it better. But of course that is way too strong, so I want to make it much more subtle. So on the strength value here on this bump, I'm going to use a value of 0.06. And that way there is a little bit of noise all over the surface, but it is pretty subtle. Now I also want to add one more layer of bump, and that is going to be the texture of the leather. So let's click on the bump node, I can press shift D to duplicate it, and let's put the normal into the normal, and we can now put another value into the height. So let's take this mix right here, this mix is the color, let's take the result, and I can put that into the height value. And then I can turn the strength up, and you can see we now have that bumpy leather texture. But I do want this to be pretty subtle as well, so I'm going to turn this to a 0.23. And there we go, we now have the procedural generic leather material. So I now want to join this together into a custom node group. So what I'm going to do is click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output, and then you can press ctrl G to join it together into a node group. And then you can hit the tab key, and that's going to go in and out of the node group. So let's just drag the node group over here, and I can make it a little bit bigger, and then I want to click here on the material name, and I will copy that with ctrl C, and then I can click here on the node group, press ctrl V, and hit enter. So it's now called generic leather. So let's now hit the tab key to go into the node group, and you can press the N key to open up the side panel. And if you click here on group, we have inputs and outputs. So right here on the outputs, I want to double click on this, and I want to rename this to shader because I like that better. So let's now go over here, and we're going to take the group input, and we're going to drag this down here under the texture coordinate. And then this mapping node here, it is connected up to all the textures. So we can use the scale values of the mapping to change the size of the entire material at once. So we can take the mapping scale, and let's put that here into the group input. And then it's going to show up right here. But I want to make it one single value, not three values. So here on the type, I want to click on the vector, and I want to change it to float instead. And that way, it's going to use number values. Now here on the default value, I just want to turn the default back to one because one is the default scale. And then you can see the texture disappeared. That's because I need to go out of the node group, and I just need to turn the scale value to one. But now we have the scale value that we can drag around to change the entire size of the material. So let's go back into the node group. Now also right here on the scale, there is a minimum and a maximum value. And I want to take the minimum value, and I just want to turn that to zero. That way, zero is the smallest value. So outside of the node group, I can only drag this down to zero, I can't drag it any further. But then I can also turn it up over one if I wanted to. So let's go back into the node group. So I'm going to click on this group input now, and I want to press shift D to duplicate it, we're going to drag it over here, and I want to stick it above this color ramp. And so now we can plug the colors up to this other group input node. So let's take this color, drag this in here, and then take this one here, color B, and we're going to put that into the extra socket here. And then this last one here, let's take B and put that into the extra socket. Now if I go out of the node group, this last color here, if I change this around, you can see that is the color of the noise. So I'm going to go back into the node group. And here on the last color, I can rename this to noise color. But then here on color A and color B, I'm just going to call this color one. And also here, I'm going to rename this to color two. So let's click on this group input, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it. And let's drop it right down here next to these textures. So I want to have custom values for some of these textures here. And this Voronoi texture scale, this is going to change the scale of just that leathery texture. So I can take the scale and let's put that here into the extra socket. And then I can double click on this to rename it and I will rename it to leather scale. Now if I hit the tab key to go out of the node group, you can see here's the leather scale, but it's a really big number. And so I have to drag it around a lot in order to see anything taking effect. So I'm going to hit the tab key to go back into the node group. And I want to make this value more sensitive. So I'll press shift A, let's go to the search. And I want to search for the math node. And let's drop the math node here after the leather scale and all the leather scale to actually be going into the bottom socket. And then I want to multiply the values so that it is more sensitive. So on the ad here, I want to change this to multiply instead. And then here on the multiply amount, this top value, I'm going to multiply it by 20. So now if I go outside of the node group, because we've multiplied this value, it's really big. So I want to make the leather scale much smaller now. So I'm going to turn the leather scale to just a value of 30. And that way it is back to its normal size. And then if I go back into the node group, this leather scale right here, I don't want the default value to be 530. I want to change it just back to 30 because that's a better default scale. And then I also don't want to be able to scale it any smaller than zero, because I don't want it to be negative. So right here on this minimum value, I can just turn this to zero. And then the max can just be at 1000 because that's very big. So if I now go outside the node group, because of that math node that we added, we can just drag this way down. And you can see it's quickly going to be much smaller, or we can drag it way up. And so this value is much more sensitive. So I'll turn the leather scale back to the default of 30. And then if I go back into the node group here on this leather scale, I actually want to click on the arrow here just to bring it up. So it is right here after color two. Now I also want to be able to control the noise scale. So this first noise texture here, I can drag the scale around and you can see it's going to change the size of the noise. So let's put the scale into the extra socket here. And then if I click on this to rename this, I can rename it to noise scale. And then if I click on the noise scale here, here on the minimum value, I also want to turn this to zero because I think that'll just be better. So we can't go into the negative values. So let's click on one of the group inputs and I'll press shifty to duplicate it. And I want to drag it right down here, kind of under this mix, because I now want to add the roughness. So this hue saturation value, this value is going to control the roughness. So let's put the value here into the extra socket. And then if I double click on this, I can just rename it to roughness. And then let's also drag the group input down here. And we can also add the bump strengths. So let's take this first one here and I can put the strength into the extra socket here. And then I can rename this and I'm going to rename this to leather bump strength. And then let's do the second one here. So this one will go in here to the extra socket. And this one I want to rename to noise bump strength. And then the last one here, let's take the strength value, let's put that into the extra socket. And then I can click on this to rename this. And I want to rename this to folds bump strength. And then one more thing before I finish up the material, I want to click on this noise scale. And I actually want to click on the arrow here to bring it up just because I prefer the noise scale to be above the noise color. So then to make the final node setup look a little bit cleaner, you can select the group inputs and you can press Ctrl H. Ctrl H is going to collapse the group input so that it is smaller. And you can only see the values that are actually plugged into it. So I'll click on this one, Ctrl H, this one here, Ctrl H and Ctrl H. So we can hit the tab key to go out of the node group. And here is the generic leather. So we can change the overall scale of the material. And then we can also change color one. And we can also change color two. Then we also have just the leather scale. And then we have just the noise scale. And then we also have this noise color as well. Then we can change the roughness of the material. And then finally, we have three bumps strength. So the leather, the noise and also the folds. So there we have it, there's the procedural generic leather material. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial. And thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCw7mgSNrGk,Procedural Cracked Ice Material 🧊 (Blender Tutorial),"This Blender tutorial guides viewers through the process of creating a procedural cracked ice material using a node setup. The instructor demonstrates how to customize various aspects of the material, such as scale, crack color, ice color, crack thickness, distortion, detail, jaggedness, and bump strength. They also show how to assemble these elements into a custom node group for ease of use. Additionally, the tutorial provides tips on setting up the 3D viewport with lighting, HDRI, and objects for previewing the material. The tutorial concludes with information on purchasing the material and other procedural material packs from the instructor's Gumroad store and Patreon page.","In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural cracked ice material in Blender. So here is the procedural node setup, and after we create the node setup, I'm going to show you how to join the material together into this custom node group. So we have the scale to change the entire size of the material, and I actually think the material looks really cool when it is much smaller, that does look pretty cool. Then we also have the cracks color, so you can make it a different color if you want to. Then we also have the ice color, so you could make it more of just like a gray color, you could also make it brighter or darker. Then we also have the cracks thickness, so I can drag this down or drag it up to change the size of the cracks. Then we also have the cracks distortion, so if I turn this up, it's going to make the cracks much more distorted or less distorted. Then we also have the cracks detail, so I can turn this down, you can see now it's very smooth, or I can turn this up, and you can see it's very, very detailed. Then we also have the cracks jagged, and I think this value is really cool, so if I turn this up, you can see now the cracks are kind of moving all around, and it looks very jagged. Then we also have the material roughness, so you can make this more shiny or more rough. And then finally, we have the cracks bump strength, and then also the ice bump strength.

So before we create the material, I'm going to show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I pressed Shift-A, I went here to Mesh, and I added an icosphere, and I like adding an icosphere because it's nice and smooth and round, and it's a nice object to preview the material on. Now right behind me, if you click here on the Add Icosphere Settings, I just turned the subdivisions up to 6 so that it is a nice smooth icosphere. And then you can use the Object Context menu and shade the object smooth. And then I also wanted a more interesting object to preview the material on, so if you press Shift-A, you can go to Mesh. I'm going to add a monkey head, and I'm going to bring the monkey head over, and I'll bring it back a bit and kind of rotate it over. And then using the Object Context menu, I'm going to shade the object smooth. And then I want to give it more geometry, so I'm going to press Ctrl-2. That is the shortcut key to add the Subdivision Surface modifier. Now when modeling to the real-life scale in Blender, the default primitive objects are a little bit higher than the average human. So these objects are a little bit large. So I'm just going to select both of these objects. I'm going to hit S to scale, and I'm going to scale them by 0.2 and then Enter, just so that they are much smaller. And then after you've scaled this, just press Ctrl-A, and you can apply the scale, so this is now the object's new default size. And then I also added a camera here, and I pointed the camera at the objects. And if you select the camera and then click here on the Object Data Properties to go to the camera settings, I turned the focal length up to 90, and that way it just zooms the camera in and makes everything look a bit more flat. Now for the lighting, if you go over here to the World Properties, I added in this Birchwood HDRI. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, links in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So just add a new world, and then you can click on the yellow dot here next to Color, and you can choose Environment Texture, and then you can click on the Open button and just open the downloaded HDRI. So this world will give us some nice lighting and reflections to light up the scene, but I do just want to add some more lights to really light up those scenes, so I added these two lights here. So these are both area lights, and so this first one over here is on this side, and on the area light settings, I turned the power to 1000, and I turned the color to a slight blue color. And then this one here, this is kind of like a rim light on the back, so this is again an area light, and the shape is set to Rectangle, and I made it really long, and I turned the power to 200, and this also has a very slight blue color. Now also, if you want to make the background transparent so you can't see it in the background, you can open up the Film tab, and then you can just checkmark the Transparent button, so that way the background isn't quite as distracting. And also, if you go down here to the Color Management, I'm using the View Transformer Filmic, and I'm setting the look here to High Contrast, and this is going to make the colors more saturated and contrasty. So I am in the Shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the Rendered mode, and then I have the Shader Editor right over here. So I will click on New to add a new material, and I can just rename the material to Cracked Ice. And then what you can do is you can click right here, and you can drag and drop the material onto the other object, or just select the other object, and then from the dropdown, you can select the Cracked Ice material. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes, so if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit, and you can go to the Preferences, and then over there on the Add-ons tab, just search for Node Wrangler, and you can checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So let's start by creating the Cracked texture. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the Search, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's drop the Voronoi here, and then with the Voronoi texture selected, I'm going to press Ctrl-T, that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler, and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then also using the feature of the Node Wrangler, you can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key, and then select different nodes, and that is going to preview the node on the object. Now I want to use the object coordinates, because the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly, so let's take the object, and I'm going to put that into the vector of the mapping. Now I can change the scale of the Voronoi texture, and I can make this smaller, and you can see we have all these little dots. But we don't really have that Cracked texture. So what I'm going to do is click on the F1 here, and I'm going to change this to Distance to Edge. And now we have this really cool Cracked texture. And also right here on the 3D, I'm going to change this to 4D instead. And now that we have the 4D, we have this W value, and you can drag this around, and this is going to kind of randomize the Cracks. And I actually forgot to put this into the Custom Node group in the introduction of this video, so I'll be adding this into the Custom Node group. So right here on the scale, I want to turn this to 10, because I think 10 is pretty good for the Cracks. Now if you look here on the edge of the Cracks, the Cracks aren't very random, they're very straight. And so I want to distort the placement of the Voronoi texture so that it is very random. So to do that, I'll press Shift-A, let's go to the Search, and I can search for a noise texture, and let's put the noise texture between the mapping and the Voronoi. So because the noise texture is going through the vector, it's distorting the placement of the Voronoi texture. So now you can see it's very random. So let's now change some of the noise texture settings. So here on the scale, I want to turn this to like a 10, so it is bigger. Let's also turn the Detail all the way to the max of 15, so it's very detailed. And here on the Roughness, to make it even more detailed, I'm going to turn this up to a 0.6. And you could also turn up the Distortion if you want to, but I'll just keep it how it is. Now this noise texture is distorting the Cracks so much that you can't really even see the Crack texture. It just looks like a bunch of noise. And so I want to make the noise texture less strong. So I want the noise texture to have less of an effect over the distortion of the Voronoi. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the Search. And I'm going to search for the Mix node. Let's drop the Mix node up here. And here on the Float, I don't want to use the number values, so I'm going to click on this. And I'm going to change it to Color instead. And then I'm going to just drop the Mix node here in between the noise and the Voronoi. Let me drag this over so I have a bit more space. So I want the noise texture Color to actually be going into Color B. And then this mapping node here, this Vector, this is the mapping which isn't distorted at all. And so I want to put this into value A. So now the Mix is mixing between not being distorted at all and being very distorted with the noise texture. So I can now drag the factor back and forth, and you can see if it's 0, it's not distorted at all. And then as I turn this up, it's more and more distorted. Now as I move this around, you can see the texture is moving around a lot. So to make it so it's not moving around so much, you can click on the Mix here, and you can change it to the Linear Light instead. And I can now drag this, and you can see it's just distorting it, but it's not actually moving the texture. Now I want the Factor to be very, very small, because I still want to be able to see the cracks, but I just want the cracks to be a bit noisy. So I'm going to turn the Factor value to a 0.024. So a 0.024, and now you can see it is pretty subtle, but it is definitely noisy. Now I want to make the cracks much smaller, because they are quite thick right now. So right here on the Voronoi texture, I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the Search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and let's drop the color ramp right here after the Voronoi texture. And then I can drag these values together, and you can see as I drag it together, it's going to be more contrasty, and so it's going to make the cracks much smaller. So I'm going to drag the white tab way over here so that it is very small. Now later on when we create the customizable node group, I do want a value which is going to change the size of those cracks. And if the values are darker, if they're less saturated, you can see the cracks are bigger, but if I drag this over, they're going to be more sharp. A really easy way to create a custom value for this is to press Shift-A, go to the Search, and you can search for the Hue Saturation Value node. And let's put this in between the Voronoi and the color ramp. And so the Hue Saturation Value node has the value, and the value is going to change it from white to black. So if you turn the value down, it's going to make it darker, or if you turn the value up, it's going to make it lighter. And so that will change the size of the cracks. So we can use this in the customizable node group. Now I also want to mix in a noisy texture to give it more detail. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the Search, and I'm going to search for the Musgrave Texture, and let's put the Musgrave Texture here under the Noise Texture. And then I want to use the object coordinates, so here on the mapping, let's take the vector, and I can put that into the vector of the Musgrave Texture. And also, I want all the textures to be going into this mapping, and that way, this mapping node can be used to change the size of the entire material with the scale values. Now to preview the Musgrave, let's hold down the Ctrl and Shift key, and then select it to preview it. So I now want to change some of the Musgrave Texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to, like, 3, and then I also want it to be very detailed, so let's turn the detail all the way to the max of 15. And then right here on this dimension, I want to turn this all the way down to 0, and now that it's down to 0, you can see we have this really cool noisy texture. So I now want to put this noisy texture into the base color, which we have right here. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the mix node, because the mix node will allow us to mix two colors together. So let's drop the mix node up here, and let's click on the float, and I can change it to color instead, because we are mixing color values. So I now want to go back here to the Musgrave Texture, and I want to take the height value, I want to drag this over, and I want to put it into the factor of the mix. Then I want to take this color ramp here, and I'm going to put it into value A. And then I can Control-Shift and select the mix to preview it. So the factor is determining where it's going to be value A and where it's going to be value B, and so that is the black and white texture of the Musgrave. So now the color ramp here, this is the cracks, and this is going into A, and so now B right here, this is going to be the color of the Musgrave. So I just want to make this fully black so that it is darker, and so now it is the same color as the cracks. So now I actually want to make the customizable colors. So I'm going to drag the material output back here, and then I want to click on this mix, and I want to press Shift-D to duplicate it, and I'm going to drop it right here after the first mix. Now this mix result, this can go into the factor, so now we can change color A and B to be the cracks color and the ice color. So here on color A, I just want to make this fully white, and then here on color B, you can really make this any blue color that you want, but I found that kind of a grayish, kind of dark blue and a not very saturated blue looks pretty good. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using here on color B, you can go to the hex value, and you can punch in 586A76. That is the exact color that I'm using. Now if you take a look at the material, you can see most of it is actually that white color, and there's just some blue here and there, but I want more of the blue color. So I'm going to make this Musgrave texture more contrasty so that you can't see quite as much of it. So I'm going to click on this color ramp right here, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it, and let's drop it right down here between the Musgrave and the mix, so just drop it right there. And then I can hit the backspace button with the color ramp selected, and that is going to reset the color ramp. So now to make the Musgrave less visible, I can click on the black tab and I can just drag it over, and I'm going to drag it over to about here, you can drag it over more if you want. I just want to drag it to about here, I think that is pretty good. So now you can see much more of the blue, you can really see the difference. Right back up here, this mix, this is our final base color. So I'm going to drag the principled shader over here, and then I want to take the mix result, and I want to put that into the base color of the principled shader, and I can drag the material output here, and then I will Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And there we go, it's starting to look like cracked ice. Now ice is very reflective and shiny, so I want to turn this roughness value way down. And I'm going to turn the roughness to a .073, just a .073, so it is very shiny, and now you can see it's reflecting the HDRI. Now obviously you can see through ice, and so I want to turn this transmission value up, and the transmission value is going to make it act like glass or water. Because now if I go inside this object, you can see it actually is transparent. If I go in here, you can actually kind of look around, and you can see the light is passing through it. Now I don't want it to be transparent all over the place, I want it to be more transparent when you're looking straight at the material, but then over here on the side of the object, I want it to be a bit less transparent. So I'm going to press Shift-A, I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for the layer weight node. Let's just drop the layer weight here, and then I'm going to Ctrl-Shift and select it to preview it. So the layer weight node is going to make the edges of the material a bit lighter, but then it's going to make the center of the material darker. And you can see even if I move around my view, it's actually changing where it is light, because it's actually changing depending on the angle that we are looking at the faces. So if I go right over here, kind of look at this face here, you can see it is darker, but then if I navigate over here to the side, now because we are looking at this face on an angle, it is more white. So I want to take the Fresnel here, and I want to put the Fresnel into the transmission. So this way, some parts will have more transmission, and other parts will have less transmission. But if I Ctrl-Shift and select the principal shader, it is very hard to see, and that is because this layer weight is very gray. However, if I drag this blend value, you'll be able to see it better. So if I Ctrl-Shift and select the layer weight, if I turn the blend value up, it's going to be a bit lighter. So if I Ctrl-Shift and select the principal shader, now you can see if I turn the blend value up, it's going to be more transparent. Or if I turn it down, it'll be darker, and so it'll be less transparent. But I want to have even more control over this value. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for another color ramp, and let's put the color ramp here between the layer weight and the transmission. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the color ramp to preview it. So what I first want to do is make it more contrasty. So I'm going to drag this over here, and I actually want to flip the values. So I'm going to drag the black tab over here, and the white tab over here. So now you can see it's very contrasty. So on the sphere, we basically have this dark circle, and it is white in the middle. So I'm going to drag this white tab to about here, and then I'll drag the black tab over to about here. Now, if I Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader, that is going to be way too contrasty, because you can see right in here, it's like super transparent, and then there's kind of like that weird circle there, and then it's like not transparent over here. It's just very reflective. So to fix this, I can turn this black value up. So if I go to the color ramp, click on the black tab, I can click here on the color, and I can turn this up, and now it is going to be a bit more subtle. And if you want to use the exact same gray color that I'm using, you can click on the gray color and go to the hex, and you can punch in a hex value of B7, B7, B7. Now, where the cracks are, I want that to have less transmission. So I want to take the cracks texture, and I want to mix that here into this transmission value. So I'm just going to select this mix node right here, and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it, and let's drop it here in between the color ramp and the transmission. And so I'm going to use this mix to mix in the cracks. So this color ramp right here, I'm going to put it into value B. And then this color ramp right up here, if you Control-Shift and select this color ramp, this is the cracks texture. So I'm going to take this color, and I'm going to put it into the factor. And then I can Control-Shift and select this mix to preview it. Now, I want to be able to see the cracks a bit better. So here on A, on this color, I'm just going to make this a bit darker, and now the cracks are a little bit darker. And for color A, the hex value that I'll be using is going to be E6 times. You can punch that into the hex value if you want to use the same color that I'm using. Now, if you Control-Shift and select the principled shader, you can take color A, and you can make this darker. And if it's darker, you can see the cracks better because they don't have any transmission. But if you turn it up to fully white, then you can see through the cracks. So that's why I want to just turn it down a little bit so you can see the cracks a little bit better. All right, so we are almost done with this material, but this material is very smooth. And so I want to put some data into the normal to give it some bump. So I want the cracks to be a bit bumpy. So we can take this color up here on the cracks. I can take the color, and I can put that into the normal. Now, you can see there's some weird shading issues, and that's because we need to convert this color data into normal data that the shader can use. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the bump node. And let's put the bump node here before it goes into the normal. And then I want the color of the color ramp to actually be going into the height value of the bump, and this way it'll convert it to normal data. So now you can see those cracks are bumpy. But that is a bit too strong, so I want to turn this down so it's less strong. And I actually want to turn it to a value of 0.25. So that way, if you zoom here into the cracks, you can see they're bumpy, but it is kind of subtle. And then I also want just some overall noise over the entire ice. So we have this noise texture right here, and we can use this noise texture, and we can put it into the bump to add a bunch of noise. So to mix two bump maps together, you can click on the bump. You can press Shift-D to duplicate it and drop it down here. Now, the normal can go into the normal. So now we've mixed the two bump nodes together, and we now have this height value that we can add data into. So let's go here to the noise texture, and we want to take the factor value. Let's drag this over, and I want to put it into the height of the bump. So now you can see the ice is very bumpy, but it is way too strong, so I want to make it much less strong. So I'm going to turn the strength to a 0.07. And that way, now there is some bump over the surface, but it is quite subtle. And there we have it. So that is the procedural cracked ice. So let's now join this together into a custom node group. So what I'm going to do is click and drag just to box select all these nodes except the material output. And then I want to press Ctrl-G. Ctrl-G will join it together into a node group, and you can press the Tab key with the node group selected to go in and out of the node group. And let's just drag this over here. And then I also want to drag it out so it's a bit bigger. And then if I click here on the name Cracked Ice, I can press Ctrl-C to copy that. And then I can click here on the node group and press Ctrl-V just to paste that name. So now we have the Cracked Ice shader. So let's hit the Tab key to go into the node group. And if you press the N key, that's going to open up the side panel here. And you can click over here on the groups tab. And here we have the inputs and the outputs. Now right here on the outputs, I like to rename this to shader because I like that better. So if I click on this, I can just rename it to shader. So now outside of the node group, you can see it says shader. So let's hit the Tab key to go into the node group. And we can now add all the different values, all the custom values into this group input. So the first value that I want to add is the overall scale. So we have the mapping right here. And because all the textures are going into the mapping, this scale value is going to change the size of the entire material. So let's take the scale and I can put that into the group input. Now right up here, you can see it's the group input. So you can rename this if you want to, but I want to leave it at scale. But you can see that's a purple dot there. And so that is going to have all three values, but I just want to have one scale value. So right back here in the group input, if you click on the scale, I want to change the type here to float. And that way it's going to use one single value. Now also the default value, I just want to turn this to one. And then you can see it's gotten rid of the texture. That's because I need to go out of the node group and here on the scale, I just need to turn that to one. And then I can go back into the node group. So let's now add the custom colors. So I'm going to drag the group input over here and I'm going to drag it over, way over to this mix. And I want to take value A, let's put that here into the group input and also value B, put that in here. And then I can rename these. So I'm going to rename this to cracks color and then also the ice color. Now I also want to control the thickness of the cracks. So I'm going to drag the group input over here to the hue saturation value. And this value is going to make it lighter or darker. And so it'll change the size of the cracks. So let's put the value into the extra socket here and I can click on this to rename this and I will rename it to cracks thickness. Now, if I drag the group input back here to this linear light, this mix, this factor here is controlling the distortion of the cracks. So I want to put the factor into the extra socket here and then I can rename this and I will rename this to cracks distortion. Now let's drag the group input right down here under the mapping. And I want to put the roughness and distortion into the group input because on the noise texture, if I turn up the roughness, that's going to make it more detailed. And also if I turn up the distortion, that's going to make it look more jagged. So let's take the noise texture roughness, put that in here. And also the noise texture distortion, I can put that in there. And then this first one here, I want to rename to cracks detail. And then the second one, I want to rename to cracks jagged. Now right here on the Voronoi texture, we also have the W value and that's just going to randomize the cracks. So let's take the W value and I can put this in here. And then I can rename this to cracks randomize. And then I also want to be able to control the roughness of the ice. So let's go over here to the principled shader. I just want to take the roughness. Let's drag this way over and I can stick this here into the group input. And then finally, to finish this off, I want to have the bump strengths. So if I go right here to the first bump, this is controlling the bumps of the cracks. So let's take the strength value. I can drag this over, stick it in here, and I can rename this to cracks bump strength. And then finally, let's do the last one here. So let's click on this bump. We can take the strength. I can drag this over and let's put this here into the last one. And then this one is going to be ice bump strength. So I can now hit the tab key to go out of the node group and the node is finished. And I'll press the N key to close that side panel. So we have the overall scale. Then we also have just the crack color. Then we also have the ice color. So you can make this like a brighter blue if you wanted to. And then we also have the cracks thickness. You can make that bigger or smaller. We also have the cracks distortion. And we also have the cracks detail. And we also have the cool cracks jagged value to make the cracks really jagged and bumpy. Then we also have the cracks randomized. You can just randomize that if you want to. And then we also have the roughness value to change the roughness of the ice. And then we have the cracks bump strength and the ice bump strength.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1T8H58EP70,Procedural Pixel Shaders (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create procedural pixel shaders using node setups and custom node groups. The video covers creating a basic pixel shader with adjustable scale and color options, setting up a driver to control color ramps, and creating materials that randomly generate pixel patterns when duplicated. Additionally, the tutorial explains how to make Minecraft-style shaders, including sand, dirt, and stone blocks, and how to add bump maps to these materials for a more textured appearance. The project files are available for free on the creator's Gumroad store and Patreon page.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create these procedural pixel shaders in Blender. So I'm going to start by showing you how I created this basic pixel shader, and then here is the node setup, and after we create the node setup, I'll show you how to join it together into this custom node group. So we have the scale of the pixels, then we also have color1 and also color2, and then we also have this color factor, and this is actually controlling the color ramp in the material. So I'm actually going to show you how to set up a basic driver, and the driver is actually going to edit the position value of this black tab here on the color ramp. And as well as that, I'll also show you how to set up the materials, so that whenever you duplicate the material, it's going to randomly generate different pixels. So you can see as I'm duplicating this, the pixels have random positions. And then after that material, I'll also show you how to create some Minecraft-style shaders. So I'll show you how to create a sand block, a dirt block, and also a stone block. And then I'll also show you how to give these materials some normals to make them look bumpy and make them look like they're some sort of advanced texture pack with a bump map. And the project files of this tutorial are completely free on my Gumroad store and Patreon page, so links are in the description if you'd like to download these materials. And if you're downloading on Gumroad, you can just type 0 into the price box and then download for free. But if you'd like to send me a little tip and help support this channel, you can punch in a few dollars into the price box before purchasing, and that's a great way to send me a little tip and help support this channel. So real quick, I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I press Shift-A, I went here to Mesh, and I added a cube. And then the default primitive shapes in Blender are a little bit higher than an average human when modeling to the real-life scale in Blender. So what I'm just going to do is scale this by 0.5 and then hit Enter, so it's only half the size. And then I can press Ctrl-A, and I can apply the scale, so that's now the object's new default size. Now for the lighting, if you go here to the World Properties, I added in the AbandonedTankFarm04, and this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, links in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So when you download the HDRI, you can add a new world, and then next to Color, you can click on the yellow dot, and you can choose Environment Texture, and then you can just click the Open button and open up the downloaded HDRI. And then if you want to make the background transparent so you can't see the HDRI in the background, you can go here to the Render Properties, and you can open up the Film tab. And then you can just checkmark the Transparent button, just to hide the world from the viewport. And then also to make the colors look a bit nicer, if you open up the Color Management, I'm using the View Transform of Filmic and the Look at Very High Contrast, just to pop out the colors and make everything look more contrasty and saturated. So I'm in the Shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right over here, and I'm in the Rendered mode. And then I have the Shader Editor right over here, and I'm just going to select this object. Let's click on New to add a new material. And then I will also be using the NodeWrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the NodeWrangler enabled, just click on Edit, and then go to the Preferences, and then over there on the Add-ons tab, just search for NodeWrangler, and you can checkmark the NodeWrangler add-on. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So I'm going to press Shift-A, I'm going to go to the Search, and I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture, and let's drop it down here. And then I can Control-Shift and select the Voronoi texture. That's using the feature of the NodeWrangler. So if you Control-Shift and select different nodes, that'll preview the node on the object. Now I want to Control-Shift and select the Voronoi texture twice, because I want to preview the color values. And as you can see, it's giving us this colorful, cracked texture. Now I can take this Randomness value, and I can turn this to zero. And already we have something close to a pixel texture. Now the colors are all random, but we already have all of these little squares with different colors. Now with the Voronoi texture selected, I'm also going to press Control-T. That'll add the texture coordinate and mapping. And I want to use the object coordinates, so I'll put the object into the vector. And the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. And then we can also use the scale values of the mapping to scale the entire material. Now I want to have more pixels, so I'm just going to scale this up by turning up the scale value on the Voronoi. And specifically, I'm going to use a scale value of 37, because I found that 37 looks good. If I zoom way in here to the corner, you can see that 37 makes it so that the pixels all have an even size. Because if it's a little bit offset, like something like that, then some of the pixels on the edges of the cube will be smaller or bigger. But of course, that will depend on what object you're adding this onto. So this pixel shader does look cool, and if you like the rainbow colors, you can leave it how it is. But I want to be able to control the colors better. So I'll press Shift-A, let's go to the search. And I can search for a color ramp, and let's drop the color ramp here after the Voronoi texture. So now it is just black and white. So you can now drag these values around, and that's going to make it more contrasty. Now what you could also do is you could just change the colors here. So if you just want to make it some different colors, you could maybe make this blue. You could also hold down the Ctrl key and click right here in the color to make a new tab. And you could just make it whatever colors that you want. But what I'm going to do is select the color ramp and then hit the backspace because I want to reset the color ramp. So what I want to do instead is click on the linear here, and I want to change it to constant. Because I don't want any blending within the colors, so I'm not going to use linear. You can see linear has some different gray values because it's blending black and white. So I'm just going to change it to constant. And now if I drag this out, you can see it's only going to be white or black. And so now we have this really cool pixel shader. And again, if you wanted to, you could do the same thing by holding down the Ctrl key, adding some tabs. You could make some different colors, and you could kind of drag this around. I'm not going to do that though, but you could totally customize this how you want. Now I actually want to flip the color ramp values, so I'm going to drag the black over here and then drag the white over here. So now I can drag this black tab around, and it can either be fully white or it can turn more and more black. Now when we join this together into a custom node group, I want to be able to control these color ramp colors. So I'll press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a mix node. Let's drop this up here. And then I want to click on the float, and I want to change this to color instead. And then I can drop the mix node after the color ramp. Now we actually want the color ramp color to be going into the factor. And so the factor is controlling where it's going to be color A and where it's going to be color B. So now I can make the two colors. So on color A, I'm just going to make this black, and then on color B, I can just make this fully white. But of course, you could change this to whatever colors you want. And then I'm going to drag the principled shader right here, and I'm going to take the result from the mix, and I can just put that into the base color, and then I can Control-Shift and select the base color to preview it. And then you could also play around with the roughness if you want it to be more rough or more shiny. Or you could also turn the specular down if for some reason you didn't want any reflection. You can see if I turn the specular all the way to zero, there still are some shadows, but there isn't any reflection. I'm going to leave the specular at a 0.5. Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of this video, I want to be able to duplicate these objects and have the pixels be randomized every time I duplicate the object. But you can see right now it's not actually doing that, so I'll press Control-Z to undo that. So what I want to do on this Voronoi is I want to take the 3D and I want to turn it to 4D instead. Then I can change the W value, and the W value is just going to randomize the pixels. Now, if I duplicate this, you can see it's still not randomizing the pixels. You can see it's the same, so I'm going to press Control-Z. So what I can do is press Shift-A, I can go to the search, and I can search for the Object Info node. Now I'm going to drop the Object Info right down here. Now, if I Control-Shift and select the Object Info, I'm going to continue to Control-Shift and select it, and I'm going to continue to keep on clicking on it until we get down here to the Random value. So this Random value is going to randomly generate colors from white to black every time you duplicate the object which has that material. So because this cube object has the same material, every time I duplicate this, you can see that the cubes are going to randomly be different colors. So I'll just press Control-Z to undo that. So what we can do now is we can take the Random, and we can put the Random into the W value. So you can kind of think of the white and black values as being values from 0 to 1. And so the Random values are randomly going to generate values from 0 to 1 in the W value. So let's plug the Random from the Object Info into the W value, and then I can Control-Shift and select the Principle Shader. So I can now duplicate this, and you can see every time it's going to randomly generate different pixels in different locations. And this is the base of the material, but now let's join this together into a custom node group. So I'm going to click and drag to box select all these nodes except the material output, and then I can press Control-G, and that'll join it together into a node group. And if you press the Tab key with the node group selected, that'll go in and out of the node group. So I'm going to drag this over here, and I can also drag it out to make it a bit bigger, and let's rename this to Pixel. So now I can press the Tab key to go into the node group, and if I press the N key to open up the side panel, I can click here in Group, and there are Inputs and Outputs. Now right here on the Output, I'm going to double-click on this to rename it, and I just want to rename it to Shader because personally I like that better. So let's now add all the custom values into the group input. So the first value that I want to add is the Scale to change the size of the entire material. So let's take the Scale from the Mapping, and I can put that into the group input. And then if you click right up here on Scale, right now if I Tab to go out of the node group, you can see there are three different values, but I just want one value to control the scale of the entire material. So I will Tab to go into the node group, and right here on the Type, I want to click on Vector, and I want to change it to Float instead. Then I just need to Tab out of the node group, and on the Scale here, I can change it back to the default of 1. And then I can just drag this around, and that'll change the size of the pixels. So let's go back into the node group. Now I also want to add the colors, so let's take the Mix right here. We'll take A and put that here into the group input, and then also B, we'll put that into the group input as well. And then right here, we can click on this to rename this. So I can just rename this to Color 1, and then this one right here, I can rename this to Color 2. So I'm now going to show you how to add a simple driver, and the driver is going to control this position value. And this driver is actually pretty simple to set up. So what I'm going to do right here on the inputs is I'm going to click on the plus here, and that's going to add a new input. You can see the new input is right down there, but it doesn't have anything plugged up to it. Now I want to double-click on this to rename it, and I want to rename it to Color Factor, but you can rename it to whatever makes sense for you. And then right here on the type, I don't want this to be a color value, I want this to be a number value instead. So I'm going to change it to Float. Now we actually don't want to plug anything into this Color Factor, so I'm going to Tab to go out of the node group. Now we need to copy the data of this Color Factor. So what I'm going to do is right-click on this Color Factor value, and then I'm going to click on Copy Data Path. And real quick, just to show you what this is doing, I opened up a text file on my computer, and I'm just going to press Ctrl-V, and that's going to paste the value that we copied. So this text here is the data that Blender needs to know which value that we're using. So when I right-clicked here, and then clicked on Copy Data Path, that copied that bit of text. So I'm now going to hit the Tab key to go into the node group, and I now want to add a driver to this position value, because that is controlling where the black tab is. So I'm going to right-click on this, and then I can click on Add Driver. And you can see it's going to have some driver settings, and it might look pretty complex, but we're actually only going to be changing a few of the settings. Now if for some reason you move your mouse away, and the driver settings go away, that's totally fine. You can just right-click on the position value, and then you can click on Edit Driver, and the driver settings are back up here. And you can also see the position value has turned purple, or kind of a pink color, and that is telling us that there is a driver applied to it. So again, I'm going to right-click on this position value, and I will click on Edit Driver. Now we want to change the type of the driver. So if you click here on Type, I want to change this to Some Values, because Some Values is just going to give us a number value. So now we need to give it the data that we want the one value outside of the node group to control this value. So what I actually want to do is get rid of this variable here, and I want to add a new variable. So right here, I want to click on this X button, and that'll get rid of the variable. And then I want to click here to add an input variable. So we've added a new one. Now that we've added a new one, you can see that there is this button right here. And if I click on this button, it's going to give us these different ID types. Now I am using a material, because this is a procedural material that we're creating. So if I click here on the type, I want to change this to Material. And then right here, you can see this is red. And so basically, we need to tell it what material we're using. So if I click right here, you can see here is the pixel material. And if you have a bunch of materials, you can just look right up there to see what the name is. And then you can just select the material that you're using. So you just want to select this current material. Now we have a path. And this path is where we're going to put the other data which we copied. So if you click here on the path, you can then just press Control-V, and that is going to paste the text which I showed you earlier. And then just to make sure it's working, you can click on the Update Dependencies button, and then move your mouse away so that goes away. So now I can hit the Tab key to go out of the node group. And we have told this value here that it's going to control this position value. So if I turn this factor value up, you can see now it is changing the factor of those colors. And then the last value that I want to add is a roughness value. So I'll hit the Tab key to go back into the node group. And I will just take the roughness here from the principled shader, and I will put that here into the bottom one. And then I can Tab to go out of the node group. So there we go, we have the basic pixel shader. So we have the overall scale. And then we also have the different colors. Then we also have the color factor. And then we also have the roughness of the material. So that is the first shader. So I'm now going to show you how to create those Minecraft-style shaders. So what I'll do first is just select this cube object, and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it. I'll just bring it over here. And then I can also just bring it up here, because I want some more space to make more of them. Now I'm going to click on this object here, and I'll click on the X button just to delete this material. And let's click on New to add a new material. And I can just rename this Sand. So I'm going to use the same base setup to create the pixel texture that I used in the first material. So I'll press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I can search for the Voronoi texture. Let's drop this here. And then with the Voronoi texture selected, I'm also going to press Control-T. That's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And I want to use the object coordinates, so I'll put the object into the vector. And then I can Control-Shift and select the Voronoi texture. And I want to Control-Shift and select it twice so that we can preview the color value. And then just like we did before, I want to take the random value, and I want to turn that to 0. And this way, it's going to give us these colorful pixels. And then I can also play around with the scale. Now on the scale value, I'm going to use a scale value of 17 because I like the size of that to kind of make it look like a Minecraft block. And also, I want to make sure it is a value which puts the edges of the pixels on the edge here of these blocks. Because if I turn this up a little bit, you can see there are some more pixels there on the edge, but they're too small. So I'm going to use a value of 17. Now I want to be able to control the colors, so I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I can search for a color ramp, and let's put that after the Voronoi texture. And then I can drag these back so I have more space. And I can actually just take the color, and I can put that into the base color of the principled shader. And I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. So we can now make the colors to make it look like a sand block. So on the black tab here, I'm going to click on this color. And I'm going to make this a bit brighter. I'm going to make it kind of a yellowish, tannish color. And if you want to use the same color that I'm using, you can go to the hex value, and you can punch in a hex value of C0 9E 6C. Then I'm going to hold down the Control key, and I'm going to click right about here to add another tab. And then this one, if I click on this, I want to make this kind of a pale yellow color. And the hex value that I'll be using for this color is going to be EA D7 9 3. And then this last color here, this one is going to be a very slight yellowy color and slightly green. And if you want to use the same color that I'm using, the hex value for this is FF FF DD. And now it kind of looks like a Minecraft sand block. Now, I also want to be able to duplicate this object. And I want to have the pixels be randomized each time I duplicate it. So what I'm going to do on the Voronoi texture is I'm going to click on the 3D, and I'm going to change this to 4D. And this way, we have the W value. And the W value will randomly generate different pixels. Now, when I duplicate this, I want the W value to randomly be changed from 0 to 1. And that way, the pixels will be randomized. So I'm going to press Shift-A. I'm going to go to the search. And I'm going to add an Object Info node and just drop this down here. And we're going to set this up the same way that we did with the other material. So we have this random value on the Object Info. And if you Control-Shift and click a bunch of times on the Object Info, that'll go all the way down to the random. And if I duplicate the object, the random value is randomly going to generate colors from white to black every time I duplicate the object. So I can take the random value, and I can put that into the W value of the Voronoi. And so the white and black values of the random are basically telling it different random values from 1 to 0. So this way, if I Control-Shift and select the principled shader, I can now duplicate this object. And you can see it's going to randomize the pixels every time. So now what I'm going to do to save some time is I'm going to use the same material to create the dirt block and the stone block. So with this object selected, I'll press Shift-D to duplicate. And I'm just going to bring this down on the z-axis. And then I'm just going to click on this button right here. It looks like two little pieces of paper. And that's going to duplicate the material, but it'll keep the same data. And then I can click on this to rename it. And I'm going to rename it to dirt. So the only thing that we need to change now is the colorant values. So what I'm going to do is drag this tab over a little bit. And then I'm going to make this a orangey color. And then I will make it darker so that it is brown. And the hex value that I'll be using for this material is 4b3525 if you want to use the same color I'm using. Now, I'm also going to drag this color very close because I want to make it look like there are little stones in the dirt. So I'm going to click on this color. And I'm going to click here on the RGB. And I'm going to turn these all to 1. And that way, there won't be any color. And then I can just make it a darker color. And the exact color that I'm going to be using over here on the hex value is going to be 717171. And then I'm going to hold down the Control key and click to add another tab here. And I can drag this tab over. And then this one, this is also going to be a brown color. So we're going to make it in the orange and then make it a bit darker. And the hex value that I'll be using for this color is 674b35. And then finally, I just want to add one more lighter brown right here. So I'm going to click on this color over here. And I'm going to leave it where it is over here. And I'm going to click on this color. And I'm going to make it just a bit darker and a bit more brown. And the hex value for this color will be 9b704f. And there we go. We now have a nice dirt block. So let's do the same thing and create a stone block. So I'll select this block. I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it, drop it down here. And then I can click on this file icon right here to duplicate the material. And I can rename it to stone. And then if I select the color ramp, I will hit the Backspace button. And that is going to reset the color ramp. And then I'm going to hold down the Control key. And I'm going to click right here to add a tab. And this one, I'm going to make kind of a mid-gray color. And the hex value for this one is 686868. And then this one right here, I actually want this to be a lighter color. So I'm going to make it a lighter gray. And this color is going to be 7e7e7e. And this white one over here, I'm just going to make this kind of a light gray. And this color is going to be a hex value of 8e8e8e. And there we go. We now have a nice-looking stone block. So now I'm going to show you how to edit these materials to make it look like one of those Minecraft texture packs, which look a bit more realistic and have a bit of a bump map. But they still have the original vanilla look of Minecraft with the pixels. So what I'm going to do is click and drag to box select all these objects. And I'll press Shift-D to duplicate. And I can just drop them right here. So then I can click on this object here. And I want to click on this button right here to duplicate the material but keep the same data. And then I can click here to rename the material. And I'm going to rename this to sand with bump, so sand with bump. So now we just need to add this color value into the normal to give it some bump. So let's take the color value. And I can put that into the normal. And then you can see there's some weird shading issues. That's because we need to convert the color data into normal data. So I can press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I can search for a bump node. And we want to drop the bump node in between the color and the normal. And then the color needs to be going into the height value. And now it's converting it to normal data. So now you can see the edges look a bit bumpy. Now, there is a problem with this. And that is that the edges are super sharp. And that doesn't actually work very well for a normal map. So what I want to do is make the edges a bit more smooth. And that'll actually look much better for a bump map. So what I can do is click on this F1 here on the Voronoi texture. And I can change it to smooth F1 instead. Now, if I just Control-Shift and select the Voronoi texture twice, we can see what it's doing. So F1 is going to be very sharp. But smooth F1 is the same thing, although it is very blurred. And so if we set it to smooth F1, there is also this smoothness value. So I can turn the smoothness value all the way to 0. And now it's sharp. Or I can turn it up to make it more blurry. And so if we make this more blurry, the edges won't be quite as sharp. And that'll look much better for the bump map. So I'm going to Control-Shift and select the principal shader. And I can now just drag around the smoothness value to change the sharpness of that. So I actually want to make the smoothness value very small. So I'm going to turn the smoothness value to a 0.03. So it is very small. But that is much better than having the smoothness value at 0. And then also right here on the bump node, this is a little bit bumpy. So I want to make it less strong. So I'm going to turn the strength value just to a 0.3. And there we go. So now I have that cool little bump there. And also, you could turn the smoothness value up a bit more if you wanted to. You could turn it up to maybe a 0.1 or a 0.2. But I'm going to leave it at a 0.03. So that is really it. So I'm now just going to quickly do the same exact thing for these materials. So I'll select the dirt material. I'll click on this button to duplicate the material. And I can rename it to dirt with bump. And then I want to click on the F1 here. And I want to change it to smooth F1. And I found that a smoothness value of 0.03 looks pretty good. And then I want to take the color. And I want to put that into the normal. But then I need to press Shift-A, go to the search. And I just need to search for a bump node. And I'll drop that there. And then the color can go into the height value. And then that is a bit strong. So I'll just turn the strength to a 0.3. And I'll do the same thing for this object. So I'll select this object. I'll click on this to duplicate it so it's separate from the other material. And I can just rename this to stone with bump. And then I can click here on the F1. I'll change this to smooth F1. And the smoothness I'll turn to a 0.03. And then I can take the color. And I'll put that into the normal. And then I can press Shift-A. And I can search for a bump node to convert the color value into normal data. So I'll just drop that there. And then I want to put the color into the height value. And then again, I will just turn the strength down to a 0.3. And there we have it. So there are all of the pixel shaders.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBcT4V4FLdo,Procedural Buffalo Plaid Fabric Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural buffalo plaid fabric material and combine it into a custom node group with adjustable sliders for various properties such as texture scale, colors, weave scale, checker scale, checker noise, sheen, roughness, and bump strength. The tutorial also covers setting up a basic cloth simulation and applying physics properties for more realistic interactions. Additionally, the creator offers their procedural materials for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon, and provides links to a comprehensive material pack and a playlist for learning how to create various procedural materials in Blender.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural buffalo plaid fabric material in Blender. And then after we create the procedural material, I'll show you how to join the material together into this custom node group with all of these different sliders. So we have the overall scale of the texture, then we have the different colors, so we have color 1, 2, and 3. Then we also have just the weave scale, so that's just going to scale the texture of the little weaves there for the fabric. And then we also have the checker scale, just to change the size of the checkers. Then we also have this really cool checker noise, so you can turn this up if you want the edges to be more noisy. And then we also have the sheen value, because the sheen makes materials look more like fabric. And then the roughness, and also the bump strength. If you'd like to purchase this material and help support the channel, you can get that on my Gumroad store, links in the description. And also you can get access to this material by joining my Patreon page. If you'd like to purchase more of my materials, you can also check out my Ultimate Blender Procedural Material Pack.

And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Procedural Material playlist here on YouTube. Alright, so real quick, I am going to show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport, if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I'm going to be doing a very basic cloth simulation. And if you'd like to learn the basics of cloth physics for beginners, then I have a complete tutorial on cloth physics. You can check that video out with the links in the description. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go here to Mesh, and I'm just going to add a UV sphere. And then I can shade this object smooth. Then I'm also going to press Shift-A, let's go to Mesh, and add a plane. And I can bring the plane up. I'm now going to scale the plane up, and I'm going to scale it up by 2.5. 2.5, and then hit Enter. And that way it's a little bit bigger, and we're going to be dropping the cloth on this sphere. I'm also going to press Control-A and apply the scale, so this is now the object's new default size. So I'm now going to go into Edit Mode, and then using the Object Context menu, I'm going to hit the Subdivide button. And then right above me on the little Subdivide settings, right after you subdivide this, I'm going to turn the number of cuts to 100, and that way it is very high detail, and the cloth physics now have lots of geometry to work with. Now before I actually simulate the cloth, it is very important that you UV unwrap the object, because we want the procedural texture to move along with the shape of the cloth. And so in order to do that, we're going to need to use the UV mapping to place the procedural textures on the object. So you can click right over here on the UV editing layout, and you can see the default plane was already UV unwrapped, so you can probably just leave it like that. If you need to, you can press the U button and then unwrap. And you can also check out my UV unwrapping for beginners tutorial with the link in the description if you'd like to learn more about UV unwrapping. But the default UV unwrap of this plane will be great for this material. So I can go back over here to the layout. So we can now add the cloth physics by clicking right over here on the Physics properties. So on the plane, I'm going to add the cloth physics. And then if I click on the sphere, I'm going to add the collision physics. And this way, the plane is going to interact with the sphere. Then also on this plane, I'm going to scroll down here. And there are a bunch of different settings that you can learn about in my cloth physics for beginners tutorial. But I'm just going to go down here, and I'm going to checkmark the self collision. This way, the cloth will collide with itself, and it'll look a bit more realistic. So I'm just going to press the space bar to play the timeline. And we're just going to let the cloth physics simulate. You can see it is a little bit laggy, but we'll just wait for that to finish. And if it's acting very laggy, you could also bake the simulation. So right up here, you can see that there is a cache tab. And so you can choose a simulation start and end, and then you could bake the simulation if you want to. But I'm just going to play it here. It is kind of laggy, but I will just wait until it is finished. All right, and I'm going to stop it right about there, a little after 100. So there is the simulation. So I can now just apply this. So to apply it, I'm going to go here to the modifier properties. And you can see it's been added as a modifier. So I can click on the dropdown and click on apply. And then I also just want to select the sphere here. And right over here on the collision, I can click on this button. And this is going to jump us over to the physics properties. And I can just click on the X to get rid of the collision. So I can now select this object here, the cloth object. And using the object context menu, I will shade it smooth. Now, when you're modeling to the real-life scale in Blender, the default primitive shapes are a little bit higher than the average human. So these objects are actually quite big. So I'm just going to select both of these objects. And I'm going to scale them by 0.1 and then hit enter. And I can just bring this down more into the center. So now this object is maybe around the size of a towel. And I will also press Ctrl A and apply the scale. So this is now the object's new default size. And then I do want to add some modifiers to make the cloth look a bit nicer. So if you go here to the modifier properties, let's click on add modifier. And I can start by adding the solidify modifier. And I'm just going to make the thickness very small, just something like that. So now the cloth has a little bit of thickness. And then also I'm going to click on add modifier. And I'm going to add the subdivision surface modifier. And this will subdivide it so it looks much higher quality. And then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera at the objects. Now for the lighting, I added these two area lights right here. And on both of these area lights, I turned the shape to rectangle. And then I scaled them up just so that they kind of give some nice rim lights to the edge of the fabric. And then I also gave them a power of 50. And I turned the color to a slight blue color. And then also right over here on the world properties to get some nice realistic world lighting, I added in this Machineshop 02 HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. The link will be in the description if you'd like to download it. And then what you can do is add a new world. And here on color, you can click on the yellow dot and you can choose environment texture. And then you can click on the open button and open up the HDRI. And again, I downloaded the 1K HDR version on polyhaven. And then if you want to make the background transparent, what you can do is click right here on the render properties. And you can open up the film tab. And you can checkmark the transparent button just so that the background is transparent. And also if you open up the color management, I'm going to be using the view transform of filmic and also the look to high contrast just to make things more contrasty and kind of pop out the colors. So we can now go right over here to the shading workspace. So in the shading workspace, I have the 3D view put right over here in the rendered mode. And I'm just going to select this object here. And then over in the shader editor, I can click on new to add a new material. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the node wrangler enabled, you can go to edit and go to the preferences. And then over there on the add-ons tab, just search for node wrangler and checkmark the node wrangler add-on. So to start off, I'm going to press shift A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to add a wave texture. Let's just drop the wave texture here. And then using the feature of the node wrangler, you can hold down the control and shift key and select different nodes. And that is going to preview the node on the object. Now with the wave texture selected, I'm also going to press control T. That's using another feature of the node wrangler. And this is going to add the texture coordinate mapping. Now it's going into the vector. And the vector is basically telling it how the wave texture is going to be placed on the object. Now for many procedural materials, I use the object coordinates because that works really well. But if we use the object coordinates for this fabric, it's not going to really look correct because this fabric is all curvy and it's rotated. And I want the weave of the fabric and the texture of the fabric to go along with the rotation of the cloth. And so this is why I'm using the UV mapping instead. So here on the texture coordinate, we can take the UV and we can put that into the vector. And then this mapping node is going to be used to change the location, rotation, and scale of the entire material. So now let's change some of the wave texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale down to 2. And then I also want to turn the detail to 0 because I don't actually want any detail. And then I will leave the other settings at the default. Now as well as having a texture which is going up and down, I also want a texture which is going back and forth. So I'm going to select the wave texture and I'm going to press Ctrl-Shift-D. So Ctrl-Shift-D is going to duplicate the node, but it'll keep the wires plugged up. So I now want to Ctrl-Shift and select this wave texture to preview it. Now this wave texture, I want to be going in the opposite direction. So let's click on the X here and I can change this to Y instead. So now we have one going back and forth and up and down. So now that we have these two wave textures, I want to join them together into one texture. But before I do that, I do want to make the edges look a little bit rough and make it look a little bit like fabric. So I'm going to add a noise texture and I'm going to use the noise texture to distort the edges of those waves. So I'll press Shift-A, I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's just drop the noise texture up here. And then I actually want to bring the text recording and mapping back. And then what I'm going to do is hold down the Shift key and I'm going to right-click and drag over these two wires and then let go. That is going to add a reroute and so now we just have one wire here that we can put the noise texture into. So let's drop the noise texture here in between the mapping and the reroute and then this reroute is going into both vectors. So now the noise texture is going through the vector and so it's distorting the placement of the wave textures and so it looks really distorted. So let's now change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 1 and then I will turn the detail all the way to the max of 15 so it is very detailed. And I'm also going to turn the roughness up to 1 and that way it is even more detailed. Now that is of course not what we want, it kind of looks like some sort of rusty metal texture and so what I want to do is just have the noise texture have less control over the vector. So I basically want the noise texture to be less strong. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the mix node. Let's drop the mix node up here and then I want to click on this float value and I want to change this to color instead. And then I can drop the mix after the noise texture. So I now want to take the color of the noise texture and I want to put that into value B. And then I want to take the mapping vector and I want to put that into color A. So now this factor is going to blend between using A or using B. And so I can drag back and forth, you can see it's not distorted at all but then as I turn it up it's being more and more distorted by the noise texture. Now when I do this you can see that it's moving around a lot, you can see those black lines are kind of moving around. So I'm going to click on the mix here and I'm going to change this to a linear light. This way I can drag it around and it's going to distort the edges but it's not going to move those waves around. Now I want to make the factor very small so I'm going to turn the factor to a value of 0.01. Just a 0.01, so now if I zoom in here you can see it is just a little bit distorted on the edges. Now before I join the two wave textures together into one texture I do want to sharpen them because right now you can see they don't really look like the buffalo plaid fabric. The black waves are very small and then there's kind of like this gray area right here before the little white area. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A, let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a math node and let's stick the math node right up here. And I can Control-Shift and select the math node to preview it. Now right here if you click on the type I want to change this to the greater than and it's under the comparison so change it to greater than. Then I want to take the color from this wave texture and I'm going to put that into the top value and then the threshold you can leave at 0.5. So basically the greater than is sharpening up the values. If I Control-Shift and select the color ramp you can see it's just kind of black and then it kind of has this kind of gray area. But then if I Control-Shift and select the greater than it's taking any of those gray areas and it's making it fully black and then where it's white it's making it fully white. So it's basically sharpening up those edges. So I can take this greater than, I can press Shift-D to duplicate it, drop it down here and then I can take the wave texture color and we can put that into the same one. So put it into the value. So now I can Control-Shift and select between these and we have the two different waves. So I now want to join them both together. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search and I can search for a mix node, let's drop this down here and I can click on the float and let's change this to color instead. And then I want to take the first value here from the greater than and I want to put that into value A and then let's take the second value and I can put that into B. So now you can see we are mixing them together and it's starting to look like that buffalo plaid fabric. Now it's just white and black right now so I want to make some different colors. So to make the different colors I first want to add some color ramps and we're going to use the color ramps to control which values are going to be the different colors. And then to create the different colors we're going to be using some mix nodes. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search and I can search for a color ramp and let's put the color ramp here after the mix. So I first want to create a value which is only this really black square here. So to do this I'm going to click on the white tab and I'm going to drag this over and you can see as I drag it over it's making it more contrasty so now we can just see that black square. And specifically I'm going to put this white tab at a position of 0.44. So that is the first value but I want to create another value so I'm going to click on this color ramp and I'm going to press Control-Shift-D and I'll just bring it up here and stick it there. And then I can Control-Shift and select this color ramp to preview it. So on this color ramp I actually want to leave this white tab at the same value of 0.44 but I'm going to click on this and I'm going to make it fully black. Then I can click on the other black tab and I can instead make this one fully white and then I actually want to drag it over here so it's on the opposite side. So now we have some white squares and some gray squares and some black squares. So now I can make the different colors by using mix nodes and we can mix them together. So I'll press Shift-A, let's go to the search and I want to search for a mix node. Now let's drop the mix down here and then I want to click on the float here and I want to change this to color because we're working with color values. So I can now take the bottom color ramp and I'm going to put the color into the factor and the factor is going to control where it's going to be color A and where it's going to be color B. So I can Control-Shift and select the mix to preview it. So let's take color A and we're going to make that fully black. But then here on color B, I want that to be the dark red color of the buffalo plaid fabric. And if you want to use the same exact dark red color on color B, you can go to the hex and you can punch in a hex value of 4E100E and then A will be fully black. So I now want to add this color ramp into the other colors and we're going to add the light red. So I can click on this mix, I can press Shift-D to duplicate it and let's stick it here after the first one. So now I want this color ramp here, I want that to be going into the factor and again the factor is controlling where it will be color A and where it will be color B. So then here on the mix, we can put the result into color A. So then color B can be the light red. So I'm going to make it a red color and then I'm going to make it much brighter. And if you want to use the same color that I'm using for the light red here on color B, you can punch in a hex value of CC2F2A. And there we go, so now we have the texture of the buffalo plaid fabric. So we can now take the result and we can put that into the base color of the principled shader and I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader. And let's just bring these nodes up here. So that is looking very cool, although it is looking way too shiny and cloth usually isn't that shiny. So let's take the roughness and I'm going to turn that up to like a 0.7. And then also to make it look more like fabric, let's turn the sheen all the way up to 1 and the sheen tint, I will turn that up to 1 as well. And the sheen will make it look a bit more soft and make it look a bit more like fabric. So now I want to create the weave texture and I want to put the weave texture into the normal to give it some bump. So back over here, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search and we can search for another wave texture. Let's drop the wave texture down here and then I can Control-Shift and select it to preview it. I want this mapping node to be able to control the entire scale of the material. So I want to take the vector of the mapping and I want to put that into the vector of this wave texture. And then let's change some of the settings of the wave texture. So right here on this X, I want to change this to Y. So it's going the opposite direction and then I want the weaves to be very small. So let's turn the scale up really high to like 300 and then I do want to add some more detail. So let's turn the detail to the max of 15. And then I do want some distortion because I do want the weave texture to be a little bit random. So let's turn the distortion value to 7. And now you can see it looks a bit more random. Now I also want some weaves which are going the opposite direction. So I'm going to select the wave texture and I will press Control-Shift-D and let's drop it down here. So when you press Control-Shift-D, that'll duplicate the node but keep the wires plugged up. And then I can Control-Shift and select this wave texture. And on this one, I want to click on the Y and I want to turn it back to X. So now you can see we have two weaves going in opposite directions. So I now want to make these weaves more contrasty before we join them together. So I'll press Shift-A, let's go to the search. And I can search for a color ramp and let's stick the color ramp here after the wave. And then I want to drag the black tab over and you can see it's going to make it more contrasty if I drag that over. And I'm just going to drag the black tab to about here. Then I can click on the color ramp, I can press Shift-D to duplicate it. And let's take this other wave texture and I can put that into this color ramp. So now we have two weave textures and I want to join them together. So I can actually just select one of these mix nodes and I can press Shift-D to duplicate, drop it down here. And then I can take the color ramp, let's put that into A. And then the other color ramp and I can put that into B. And then I can Control-Shift and select the mix to preview it. Now this factor is going to blend between using color A and color B. But I actually want to leave it at 0.5 and that way it's kind of evenly blending between them. So now we have this really nice fabric weave texture. So I can now put this into the normal to give it some bump. So let's take the result and I can put that into the normal. And then I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader. Now you can see there's some weird shading issues and it's not working properly. But that's because this is normal data and then this is color data. This is a yellow dot so it's color data but then this purple dot is normal data. So to convert the color data into normal data, I can press Shift-A, let's go to the search. And I can search for the bump node and let's put the bump node in between the mix and the normal. And then I want the mix to be going into the height value. And now it actually is converted to normal data so it's all bumpy. But that is a little bit too strong so I want to make it a bit less strong. So let's just turn the strength to like a 0.3. And that is it. So that is the procedural buffalo plaid fabric. So we can now join this together into a custom node group. So what I'm going to do is click and drag just to box select all the nodes except the material output. And then I can press Control-G. Control-G will join it together into a node group. And then I can press the Tab key to go out of the node group. And I'm just going to drag this up here. I'm going to zoom way in. And I can also drag this out to make it bigger. And then I can make it the same name as the material. So I'm going to copy the name of the buffalo plaid fabric. And I'm going to paste that here into this node group. So now it's called buffalo plaid fabric. I can now press the Tab key to go into the node group. And if I press the N key that will open up the side panel and I can click right over here on group. So we now have inputs and outputs. And here on the outputs I'm just going to rename this to shader just because personally I like that a bit better. But you can really rename this to whatever you want or you can leave it at the BSDF. So now right over here we have this group input. And so we can put all the values into the group input to create all of the custom values. So the first value that I want to add is the overall scale of the entire material. So let's take the scale from the mapping and we can put that into the group input. And then right here if you click on the scale I want to make this one single value. So if we click here on type instead of it being vector I can change it to float instead. And that way it'll be one single value. Now if I tab to go out of the node group we just need to turn the scale back to one which is the default. And now we can just change the scale and that'll change the size of the entire material. So let's tab to go back into the node group. So the next values that I want to add are the color values. So I'm going to drag the group input over here. And then I can put this color here into the socket. I can also take this red color put it into the socket. And then the black value I can put that into the socket. And then right over here we can click on these to rename these. So I'm going to rename these to color 1 and also color 2 and color 3. So the next value that I want to add is the weave scale. So right over here we have the wave textures here these two bottom wave textures. And we can use the scale values to control the scale of the weave. So let's take the scale from this first one. And I'm going to stick this into the extra socket here. And then if I double click on this to rename it I can just rename it to weave scale. And then I want to take this other wave texture. And I want to put the same scale value into the same socket here. And this way this single weave scale is going to change the scale of both of these wave textures at once. And then I also want to add the checker scale. So let's drag this back over here. And this wave texture here and this wave texture here this is controlling the scale of the checkers. So let's take the scale I can put that in here. And then we want to take the scale from this other wave texture. And we want to put that into the same socket. And then if I drag this down to make it bigger I can rename this to checker scale. And then I thought it would also be cool to add the checker noise. So we can take this factor right here and we can put the factor into the extra socket here. And then I can rename this to checker noise. And so if I tab to go out of the node group this checker noise is going to make the edges more and more noisy of those squares. Let's go back into the node group. Now I also want to add the sheen. So right over here if you go to the principled shader I can take the sheen value. Let's pull this out drag it over here and I can stick it in here for the sheen. Let's also add the roughness. So back over here on the principled shader I can drag the roughness value. Let's drag this over and I can stick it in here for the roughness of the material. And then the last value that I want to add is the bump strength. So we can take the bump node here. Let's pull out a wire from the strength and I can drag this over here. And we're going to stick it right up here to the final socket. And then if I click on this to rename it I can just rename it to bump strength. So we can now tab to go out of the node group. So there we go. There is the finished procedural material with all the custom values. So just to recap we have the overall scale of the entire material. Then we also have the different colors. So color one two and three. We then just have the weave scale. So to actually see this taking effect I could turn it way down to like 10. You can see there's the actual weave. But I want to leave it very big at 300 because it should be very small. Then we also have just the checker scale to make the checkers bigger or smaller. And then we also have this cool checker noise. So we can make the edges of those squares more noisy. Then we also have the sheen value to make it look more like cloth. We also have the roughness. And then finally the bump strength of those weaves. So there is the finished procedural material. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMFHaW74Zts,Procedural Caution Stripes Material 🚧 (Blender Tutorial),"In the video tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural caution stripes material in Blender. The process involves creating a custom node with adjustable sliders to modify the material's attributes such as color, scale, stripe size, offset, stripe distance, noise scale, roughness, bump strength, and rotation. The tutorial also includes instructions on setting up a 3D scene with lighting and camera adjustments. Additionally, the creator provides information on purchasing the material and supporting the channel through Gumroad, Patreon, and YouTube memberships.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural caution stripes material in Blender. And then after I create the procedural material, I'm going to show you how to join the material together into this custom node with all of these custom sliders. And the sliders will also be right over here on the side panel. So we have color one and color two. And so you can change these colors to change the colors of the stripes. We also have the scale that change the entire scale of the texture. And then we also just have the stripe scale to change the size of the stripes, and also the stripes offset. Then we also have stripes distance. So if you want the stripes to be farther away or less far away, you can change that. And then also the noise scale to just change the roughness noise. Then we also have the roughness to make the metal more shiny or more rough, and also the bump strength. And then also if you want to rotate the stripes around, there's going to be x, y, and z values to rotate the stripes around.

And you can also use the Super Thanks feature here on YouTube to send me a little tip if you enjoy this video. So let me just show you how I've set up the 3D viewport if you want to set it up the same way that I did. So I pressed Shift-A. I went here to Mesh, and I added a plane. And then I also pressed Shift-A, and I also added an icosphere. And then right behind me on the Add Icosphere Settings, right after you add the icosphere, I'm going to open up the settings. And I'm just going to turn the subdivisions up to 5. And then I'm going to shade the object smooth just so that I have a nice, smooth sphere to preview the material on. Now, these default primitive objects in Blender are pretty big. They're a little bigger than the average human height. And so I want to make these smaller. So with both objects selected, I'm going to scale the objects by 0.2 and then Enter. So now this is maybe roughly the size of a beach ball. And then with both of these objects selected, I'm going to press Control-A, and I'll just apply the scale. So this is now the object's new default size. And then so that the plane catches the light better, with both of these objects selected, I'm going to rotate them on the x-axis. And I'll type in 90 and Enter. And then I also added a camera. And I just pointed the camera at the objects. Now, for the lighting, if you go over here to the World Properties, I added in the Machineshop 02 1K HDRI. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Link's in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. And then once you download the HDRI, right here on Color, you can click on the yellow dot. And you can choose Environment Texture. And then just click on Open and open up the HDRI. And the HDRI will give us some nice realistic lighting and reflections on the material. And then I also wanted to add some more direct light. So I added this area light right here. And I kind of pointed the area light on the side. And I turned the power up to like 25 and just left it as a white color. And this will just add a bit more light to the scene. Now also, if you want to make the background transparent, you can click right over here on the Render Properties and open up the Film tab. And you can checkmark the Transparent button. And that way, if you checkmark the Transparent button, you won't be able to see the HDRI in the background. And then also, to make the colors a bit nicer, if you open up the Color Management, you can use the View Transformer Filmic. And the look here, I set this to very high contrast to pop out the colors and make everything more saturated. So I am in the Shader Editor. So I have the 3D viewport right over here. And then I have the Shader nodes right here. I'm just going to select the object and click on New to add a new material. And then I can just rename the material. And then I can also click and drag on the Material dropdown. And I can add the same material to this other object so they both have the same material. And then I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit and go to the Preferences. And then over there on the Add-ons tab, just search for Node Wrangler and enable the Node Wrangler add-on. So the add-on is built in a Blender. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So we're now going to start by creating a gradient. And we're going to use the gradient to create the stripes. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the Search. And I'm going to start by searching for a math node. Let's just put the math node right here. And then I want to hold down the Control and Shift key and select the math node. And that is going to preview it. So that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler. If you Control-Shift and select different objects, it's going to preview the node on the object. And then also with the math node with the Add selected, I'm going to press Control-T. And that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And it's also given us an image texture. But I don't want the image texture. So I'm going to select it and press X to delete it. And then let's take the vector. And I'm going to put that into the first value here on the Add. Now to create the gradient, we are going to use the object coordinates. So let's put the object into the vector of the mapping. And I can bring these kind of down here. So if I Control-Shift and select the mapping node, you can see that the mapping node is going to have the vector coordinates. And it's going to have x, y, and z values. But to turn this into a black and white gradient, we're going to use the math node. So the vector is going into the value on the math node. And so if I Control-Shift and select the math node, it's going to turn it into a black and white gradient. Because these gray dots here, that is black and white data. But then this purple dot here, that is vector data. Now you can't really see the gradient. And that's because I need to move the gradient over. So what I'm going to do is select this mapping node. And I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it. And let's stick it after the first one. And we're going to use this mapping node to move the gradient up so you can actually see it. But then this mapping node is going to be used to change the entire scale of the texture. So right here on the second mapping, I can just change the scale. So if I click on the x scale and then drag down, I can then drag back and forth. And you can see I can just bring that up. So now you can see it. And I'm actually going to click, drag down, and then let go. And then I'm going to type in 20 and then Enter so that all the scale values are at 20. So now you can see we have a nice black and white gradient. Now I don't just want one stripe. I want many different stripes. So I'm going to click on the Add node. And I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it. And let's stick it here. So we're going to put it after the first one. And then I'm going to click on Add. And we're going to change this. And under Rounding, I want to change this to the ping pong. So the ping pong sort of acts like a mirror. It kind of mirrors the texture. And so you can see it's black, then it goes to white, and then it goes to black. And if I change the scale here, that's going to change how many times it's ping ponging the values. And then if I change the value on the Add node, that is going to change the offset of the stripes. But for now, I'll just leave them both at 0.5. Now you can see it's not very contrasty. It's very gray. And it's kind of blurred. So I want to make it more contrasty. So I'll press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I can search for the color ramp. And let's put the color ramp after the ping pong. So I can now drag these two values together. And if I drag them closer, it's going to make them more contrasty. So I can just drag this one to about here and the white one over here. And I want them to be about the same size. So I don't want to drag it over here or over here, because you can see it's not going to be the same size. I want the white and black stripes to be about the same size. So I'm just going to eyeball it and just place them about there. And I'll bring them pretty close to each other. Not super close, but pretty close. So something like that's pretty good. So we now have the stripes texture. So what I can do is take the color ramp color. And I can put that into the base color of the principled shader. And then I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now, there is one problem. And that is that I don't want white and black. I want yellow. So what I could do is just take the color ramp here. And I could just turn this to a yellow color on this white tab. But I want to make this a custom node. And I want to have custom values. So instead, I'm going to use this color ramp as a factor in a mix node. And we're going to mix two different colors together, instead of just changing the color ramp colors. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for the mix node. Let's just drop the mix node down here. Now, I don't want it to be set to float. I want to click on this. And I want to change this to color, because we're working with color values. And then I can drop the mix right here between the color ramp and the principled. Now, I want the color ramp values to control what parts are going to be color A and what parts are going to be color B. So I can take the color. And I can put that into the factor. So now we have A and B. And then the factor is controlling where it's going to be A and where it's going to be B. So now I can just change the colors of A and B. So for A, I want to make that a very dark gray. And I don't want it to be fully black, because if it's fully black, I just find that it's too dark. So I'm just going to make it a very dark gray. And then here on B, I'm going to make this kind of a bright yellowish color, but slightly towards the orange. And if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, color A is going to be a hex value of 303030. And then color B is going to be a hex value of FFBE00. Those are the colors that I'm using. So now it looks like some caution stripes at maybe like a construction site, or some equipment, or something like that. Now, it isn't actually metallic right now. So let's take the metallic value and turn that all the way up to 1. Now, if you don't want it to be metallic and you just want to look more like a plasticky material, you could leave the metallic down. But I do want this to look like metal, so I'll turn the metallic to 1. And then I can also turn the roughness down, and that'll make the metal more shiny. And that is looking really cool. Now, right now, the roughness is all even all around. And so the roughness is the same all over the metal. But I want some parts to be a little bit more rough and other parts to be a little bit more shiny. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for the musgrave texture. And we're going to put the musgrave texture into the roughness to make some parts more rough and more shiny. And then also, I want to take this mapping node here, the first one, and I want to put the vector into the musgrave texture. And that way, this mapping node can be used to scale the entire material. So then I can Control-Shift and select the musgrave texture to preview it. Now, right here on the FBM, I want to change this type. And I want to instead make it the multi-fractal. And then I want to turn the dimension down. So let's turn the dimension to 0. And you can see that a bit better. And then I also want to turn the detail up. So I'll turn the detail to the max of 15. And now you can see we have a really cool texture. And also, I'm going to turn the scale down to just like a 0.5 because I do want it to be smaller. So I can now take the height of the musgrave. And I can put that into the roughness of the principled shader. And I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. So now if I zoom in here, you can see some parts are really rough, whereas other parts are really shiny because the black and white values are controlling where it's rough and where it's shiny. Now, I want to control this better. So I can actually just click on the color ramp. And I can press Shift-D to duplicate it. And I'm just going to drop it here in between the musgrave and the roughness. And then with this other color ramp selected, I can hit the Backspace. And that's going to reset the color ramp. So if I click on the white tab, if I make the white tab darker, you can see it's going to be more shiny. So if the colors are darker, they're going to be more shiny. But if they're lighter, they're going to be more rough. So now I can just play around with these values. I can play around with the two tabs. And I can make it more rough and more shiny. So I'll make this color over here kind of like a light gray. And this one is going to be a hex value of 9, 5, 9, 5, 9, 5. And then this one right over here on this side, this is going to be a slightly darker gray. And this hex value is 7, 3, 7, 3, 7, 3. If you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using, you can punch in those values. So now if I kind of zoom in closely there, you can see it does look kind of rough, but it still looks like a shiny metal. And then I also want to add just a tiny little bit of bump on the edges of the stripes. So let's take the color here from the color ramp. And I can put that into the normal. And then we need to convert this to normal data. You can see it's all black. And there's some weird shading issues. That is because this is color data. But then this is normal data. So to convert it to normal data, let's press Shift-A. I can go to the Search. And I can search for the bump node. And let's put the bump node in between the color ramp and the normal. And then we actually want it to be going into the height value. So you can put the color ramp into the height value. And that'll convert it to normal data. So now you can see the edges look kind of bumpy. And that's a bit too strong. So on the bump strength here, I'm just going to turn that to like a 0.1 so it's less strong. But now it looks like those stripes are kind of bumping up a bit. And there we go. So there is the finished material. So if you want to end the tutorial here, you can. But I'm now going to show you how to put this together into a custom node with custom sliders. So what I can do is click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output. I'm now going to press Control-G. And Control-G is going to join them together into a node group. And you can press the Tab key to go in and out of the node group. So I'll press Tab to go out of the node group. And I can drag this over here. I'm also going to drag this out a bit to make it a bit bigger. And then right here on the name, I can click on this and press Control-C to copy the name. And on the node group here, I can press Control-V to paste that. So now it's called Caution Stripes. So we can now add all the different custom values. So if I press the Tab key with the node group selected, that'll go into edit mode of the node group. Now, if I press the N key to open up the side panel, you can click here on the Group tab. And you can see there are inputs and outputs. And here on the outputs, I'm just going to rename the output to Shader, just because I like that a bit better. So right over here, you can see there is a group input. And so we can add all the values into the group input that we want to control. So the first thing that I want to control is the scale of the entire material. So let's take the scale here from the mapping. And let's put that into the group input. And it's going to show up right here in the inputs. Now, this is a purple dot here because it is vector data. But I don't want it to be using vector data, because that's going to give us all three values, so the x, y, and z. I just want it to be one value. So right here, if you click on the scale, I want to click on the type. And I'm going to change this to float. So this way, it's going to be one single value. Now, you can see the stripes have disappeared. That's because if I press the Tab key to go out of the node group, you can see the scale has been changed to 0. So I just need to click on the scale and turn it back to 1, which was the default. And now you can see that. And if I change the scale, you can see it's going to change the size of the material. So I can now Tab to go back into the node group. So the next value that I want to add is the scale of just the stripes. So to do that, we can put this scale from the second mapping node into the group input. So let's put the scale into the group input. And then again, I can click on this scale here. I can click on the type. And I can change it to float, so it is one value. And then if I double-click on the scale here to rename this, I want to rename this to stripes scale. Now, you can see the stripes have disappeared again. So I just need a Tab to go out of the node group. And then on the stripes scale, I want to turn this back to the value that it was. And it was a value of 20. So now you can see the stripes. And I can just change this to change the stripes scale. Let's Tab to go back into the group. So the next value that I want to change is the stripes offset. And this add node here is going to control that. So let's take the value of the add. And I can put this in here into the group input. And then I can double-click on this to rename this. And I can rename this to stripes offset. Now, if I change the ping pong scale, that is going to change the distance of the stripes. So I can take the scale. Let's put that here into the group input. And then I can double-click on this to rename this. And I can just rename this to stripes distance. Now, I also want to change the noise scale. So we can take the muskrape texture scale. We can put that into the group input. And then I can click on this to rename this. And I'm going to rename it to noise scale. And then I also want to control the roughness. But if you look right here, you can see that the color ramp is already going into the roughness. So we can't take the roughness and directly put that into the group input. But as I mentioned earlier, if you make the values lighter, they're going to be more rough. And if they're darker, they're going to be more shiny. So what I can do is press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for the hue saturation value. And let's put the hue saturation value after the color ramp, but before the roughness. So if I change the value, I can turn the value up and down. And that'll make it lighter or darker. So I can take the value. And I can bring that over and stick that in there. And then if I double-click on this to rename this, I can just rename this to roughness because it's controlling the material's roughness. And then I also want to control the bump strength. So let's take the bump here. I can take the strength. And let's put that into the group input. And I can rename this one to bump strength. And then just in case I want to rotate the stripes, I want to be able to control that. So this mapping node here, before the add, this rotation is going to control the rotation of the stripes. And we have x, y, and z. So I can take the rotation. Let's put that into the group input. And then I want to double-click on this to rename this. And I can rename it to stripes rotation. So if I press the Tab key to go out of the node group, we have the x, the y, and the z. And you're probably mostly just going to use the z because you'd probably put this on a flat object. But just in case you want to change the x and y, that's going to be right there. And then the one thing that we haven't added yet is the different colors. So let's tab to go back into the node group. And we have a and b here on the mix. So I can drag a. I'm going to put that here into the group input. And also, we can take color b. And I can put that into the group input. And then I want the colors to be on the very top. So I'm going to click on a here. And then I can click on the arrow. And I can bring it all the way up to the top. And I can click on b. And I can click on the arrow to kind of bring it up to the top. And then I can also just double-click on these to rename these. So I'm going to rename it to color 1 and color 2 there on the inputs. So I can now tab to go out of the node group. And there we have it. So we now have the different colors to change the stripes. We also have some different scale values and the stripe offset. And we also have the stripe distance. Then we have the noise scale if you just want to change the size of the noise. And you can also change the roughness of the metal and also the bump strength. And then you can also rotate the stripes around. So that is it. That is how you turn this into a custom node. So thank you for watching this tutorial. I hope you found it helpful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7Uc00uCWSo,Procedural Desert Camo Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the presenter demonstrates how to create a procedural desert camo material. The process includes setting up a custom node with adjustable values for colors, scale, detail, roughness, and saturation, allowing for customization of the camo pattern. The tutorial also covers creating a 3D setup with realistic lighting using an HDRI texture and explains how to organize and preview nodes using the Node Wrangler addon. Additionally, the presenter offers the material for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon and invites viewers to explore more procedural material tutorials on their YouTube channel.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural desert camo material in Blender. And then after we create the procedural material, I'm going to show you how to join it together into this custom node with these different values. So we're going to add these different color values here that you can use to change the colors of the camo. And we also have a scale value to change the entire scale. We also have the detail amount, and we also have a second detail amount to make it even more detailed. We also have a roughness slider to change the roughness, and even the saturation of the colors. So I'm going to show you how to set this up in the video. If you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this material, then you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description. You can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my materials. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. All the links are in the description. Now before we create the procedural material, I thought I'd show you the 3D setup just in case you want to set it up the same way that I have. But you can really add this procedural desert camo material to lots of different objects. You could, for instance, add it onto some fabric, maybe mix it with a fabric material to get a desert camo fabric. You could also add it to a tank or a military truck, or just add it to really any object. So I like to preview my procedural materials on spheres. So I pressed Shift-A, and I went here and added an icosphere. And then right behind me on the add icosphere settings, I just turned the subdivisions up so that it is nice and smooth. And then using the object context menu, I shaded it smooth. Now the default primitive objects in Blender are a little bit taller than the average human height. So this is a really big sphere. So what I did is scaled the sphere, and then I typed in 0.2 and Enter. Just so that the sphere is a bit smaller. And then you can just press Control-A and apply the scale. So that's the object's new default size. And then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the sphere. Now to get some nice, realistic lighting right over here on the world properties, I added in this Chinese Garden 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, links in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So once you download the HDRI, you can go here to the world, just add a new world. And then on the color here, you can click on the yellow dot, and you can choose environment texture. And then you can click on the open button, and just open up the downloaded HDRI. And this will give us some nice, realistic lighting and reflections. Now also to make the background transparent, you can go here to the render properties, and you can open up the film tab, and you can checkmark the transparent button. And that way you can't see the HDRI in the background. And then also to make the colors look a bit nicer, right here on the color management, I used the view transform of filmic, and I set the look to very high contrast. So I'm in the shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right here, and I'm in the rendered mode. And then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'm just going to click on new to add a new material, and I can rename the material. And then I will also be using the node wrangler addon to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the node wrangler enabled, you can click here on edit, and you can go to the preferences. And then over there on the addons tab, just search for node wrangler, and you can checkmark the node wrangler addon. So to start off, I'm going to press shift A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the voronoi texture, and let's just drop the voronoi texture here. And then using the feature of the node wrangler, you can control shift and select different nodes, and that is going to preview the node on the object. And also with the voronoi texture selected, I'm going to press control T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I'm going to use the object coordinates, so let's put the object into the vector. And the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. And then also the mapping node will be used to scale the entire material. So right here on the voronoi texture, I'm going to turn the scale up, so I'm going to turn it up to like a 20, so you can see more of those dots. But now I want to distort this texture, because I want to make it look more random and kind of noisy. So I'm going to press shift A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And we can put the noise texture in between the mapping and the voronoi. And so if we put it in between the mapping and the voronoi, the noise texture is going to distort the placement of the voronoi texture. So you can now see it looks much more random. And then I actually want to take the factor value, we're going to put the factor into the vector of the voronoi. And then let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to click on the 3D here, and I'm actually going to change it to 4D instead. And then the W value, you can just drag that around, and it'll kind of randomize the placement of the noise. I'm just going to turn the W value to 1. Let's also turn the scale up, so I'm going to turn the scale up to like 15, so you can see it better. And then also I will turn the detail up to the max of 15 as well, so now you can see it has much more detail. And then I will also turn the roughness up, so I'm going to turn the roughness up to like a 0.7, so it has even more detail. And then I also want to give it a little bit of distortion, so I'm just going to turn the distortion value to 0.1. And then also right here on the voronoi texture, I want to take this randomness value, and I want to turn the randomness all the way to 0. Now I'm not actually going to be using the voronoi texture distance, I'm going to be using the color instead. So if I CTRL-SHIFT and select the voronoi texture again, it's going to go down all the values, and so I want to preview the color value, and that is the texture that I'm going for. Now these are not the colors that I want, so I want to change the colors to desert camo colors, and I also want these colors to be customizable in the node group. So I'm going to press SHIFT-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the mix node. Let's drop the mix node up here, and then on the float here, I can just change this to color, because we're working with color values. And I can put the mix here after the voronoi, and we want the color to be going into the factor. So the factor value is going to control what parts are color A and what parts are color B. So we can now change these colors. So I'm going to click right here on the white tab, and I'm going to start by just making this kind of like a tan color, and then here on B, I'm going to make this kind of like a brown color. Now I actually want to edit this color value, because I want to be able to see more and less of these values. So I'm going to press SHIFT-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and we're going to put the color ramp in between the voronoi and the mix. So I can now play around with the color ramp colors, and that is going to affect the factor, and so that'll control where it's going to be color A and where it's going to be color B. So I want to be able to see these colors a little bit better. If I zoom way in here, you can see that there are more colors in there, but you're not able to see them very well. So right here on the color ramp, I'm going to hold down the CTRL key and then click in the middle, and that's going to add another tab. And then I can make this a little bit lighter. You can see if I make it lighter, now we're able to see a bit of those colors a bit better, and they're a bit darker. And if you want to use the same light gray color that I'm using, you can go over here to the hex value, and you can punch in DA, DA, DA. And then to make it even more contrasty, I can kind of drag this around. So I actually want to drag this more towards the black. And if I drag it more towards the black, now there's quite a bit more contrast. So you can see those different chunks of color. And then right back over here on the mix, if you want to use the exact same colors that I'm using, color A is going to be a hex value of B1, A4, 6, 8. And then color B, that is going to be a hex value of 5E, 4, 1, 2F. So this is the first texture in our desert camo, but I actually want to create a different texture which has a few different colors, and I want to place the texture a little bit differently, and then I want to overlay it on top of this texture. And that way it'll be a bit more random, and there'll be a few more colors. So what I'm going to do is click and drag to box select the noise texture, the Voronoi, the color ramp, and the mix. And I'm going to box select these four nodes. Then I'm going to press Ctrl-Shift-D. So Ctrl-Shift-D is going to duplicate the nodes, but it's going to keep the wires plugged up so that it's still using the mapping and texture coordinate. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the mix to preview it. So I now want to change some of the settings. So I want to take this W value here, and I want to change this, and I'm actually just going to turn it to 0, and that way it's going to move the texture around. So by changing the W value, it's basically randomizing where the texture is. And then also if I select this bottom color ramp, I want to reset it. So with the color ramp selected, I'll just hit the backspace and that'll reset it. And then I also want to change the colors of the mix. So on this second mix here, I'm going to change the colors. So the first color that I want to make is kind of like a grayish green. So I'm going to make it kind of like a very desaturated green color and a bit darker. And the hex value that I'll be using for color A is going to be 403E29. And then for color B, I want to make this kind of like a tan color. So I'm going to make it a bit brighter and kind of a yellowish tannish color. And the hex value that I'll be using for color B is going to be C49F76. So now I can control shift and select this mix and control shift and select this mix. You can see we have two different textures. So I now want to mix them together. So I'm going to select one of the mix nodes and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and let's drop it here. And I can drag this over so I have a bit more space. And then to mix these two colors together, I'm going to take the result from the first mix and I'll put that into color A. And then here on the second mix, I'll put the result into color B. And then I can control shift and select this mix to preview it. Now the factor value is going to determine how much of A it's using and how much of B it's using. And we could put a texture into the factor, but if we don't put a texture into the factor, you can see it's just going to evenly blend between one or the other. Now I actually want to click on the mix here and I instead want to change this to darken. This way it's just going to add the dark values. So now as I turn the factor up, it's going to use more and more of the other texture, but it's just adding the dark values. And so now you can see that we can see the texture underneath it. So if I control shift and select this mix, we have this texture. And then this texture here, if I control shift and select the mix, this one is being overlaid over the first one. So I can control shift and select the darken. And so you can see by dragging the factor up, we're basically overlaying this mix over this mix, and we're just adding the darker values. So now we can take the result of this darken and we can put it into the base color. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now I also want to make the textures just a tiny bit lighter. So I'm going to press shift A, I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for the hue saturation value node. And I want to put the hue saturation right here after the darken, but before the principled shader. And we can also use the hue saturation value later when we're setting up the custom material. So right here on the value, I'm just going to turn the value to a 1.5 and that way it's going to be a bit brighter. And then I also want to turn the roughness down. So on the principled shader, I'll just turn the roughness down to like a 0.3. And also if you wanted this to look like metal, you could also turn the metallic value up. And now it looks like metal, although if you turn the metallic value up, you might also want to turn the roughness up. But also if this is like a painted metal, like if you want to add this onto like a tank or a military truck or something, then because the metal is painted, you would probably want to keep the metallic value turned down. Or you could also mix this material with like a fabric texture and make it look like a camo fabric. So that is it. That is the procedural desert camo. But I'm now going to show you how to join the nodes together into a custom group with custom values. So I'm going to click and drag and box select all the nodes except the material output. And then I'm going to press Ctrl G. Ctrl G is going to join them together into a node group and you can press the tab key to toggle in and out of the node group. And also right here, I'm going to select the desert camo, press Ctrl C to copy the name, click here on the node group and press Ctrl V to paste it. So it's called desert camo. And I can also drag it out so it's a bit bigger. And also let me bring the material output over so we can now add all the custom values. So I'm going to select the desert camo and I will tab to go into the group. Now if I press the N key to open up the side panel, you can click here on group and you can see there are outputs and inputs. Now here on the output, I want to double click on this to rename this and I'm just going to rename it to shader. I like that a bit better. And then right here you can see there is a group output so you can put any values into this group output to add the outputs. And the same thing right back here. So there's also a group input and we can put values into the input. And then if I tab to go out of the group, we'll be able to see the values right here if they're in the input. So let's tab to go back into the group. And I first want to add a scale value. So we can take the mapping scale and we can plug that into the group input. And so this way we can change the scale value and that'll change the scale of all the textures. Now right here on the inputs, we have the scale right here and you can double click on this to rename it. If you want to rename it, I'm just going to leave it as scale. But if I tab to go out of this group, you can see we have an X, a Y and a Z value, but I want all of these to just be one single value. So if I tab to go back into the group, I want to click on the scale value right here on the inputs and I want to change the type from vector instead to float. So changing it to float is going to use a single value. Now you can see the texture is gone now. And if I tab to go back out of the group, you can see the scale has just been turned to zero. So we just need to turn the scale back to the default of one. So just change it to one and now you can see the texture. Now I also want to add all the colors. So let's hit the tab key to go back into the group and we can add all the colors up to the group input. So I can drag wires from A into the custom group and also B and then also here on the bottom mix, A and also B. So I'm just going to drag wires all into the group input. And then I also want to click on the scale value here on the inputs and I want to click on the arrow to bring it down. So it's at the bottom and then I can rename all these. So I'm going to double click on this to rename it and I'm going to rename this to color one. Double click on this color two and color three and color four. All right. So I've renamed all the colors. So now if I tab to go back out of the group, you can see we have all these different custom colors and I can drag this around to change the colors. So that is great. Let's hit tab to go back into the group. Now I also want to add two different sliders for the amount of detail. So what I can do is take the noise texture detail and let's put that into this extra one here. And then right here on the detail, I can double click on this and I'm just going to rename it to detail one. And then I also want to take the other noise texture and I'm going to put the detail into detail one as well. And because they're both going into the same socket, if I tab to go out of the group, I can drag around the detail and that's going to control both of them at the same time. So I will go back into the group. Now I also want to add a second value of detail. So let's take the roughness from the noise texture and let's put that into the extra socket here. And then the roughness here, put that into the extra socket. And then right here on the roughness, I can just rename this to detail two because it's not actually controlling the roughness of the material. It's controlling the detail amount. So if I tab to go back out of the group, we now have detail two and I can drag this around to give it even more detail because we added the noise texture roughness into detail two. And then I also want to add the roughness value into the custom node. So we can just take a wire from the roughness and I can drag this over, put this in here and it has already renamed it to roughness. And then the last one that I want to add is the color saturation. So we can take the hue saturation value node and we can take a wire from the saturation. Let's drag over and I'm going to put that into this extra socket here. And now that's called saturation and I'm actually going to just rename this to color saturation. And then I can tab to go out of the group. And there we have it. So the custom node is finished. So we have the scale. We also have two different layers of detail. So detail one and detail two. We also have the roughness to make it more rough or more shiny. And then also the color saturation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtUDs6sxgaw,Procedural Tile Floor Material (Blender Tutorial),"This Blender tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural tile floor material and convert it into a custom node with adjustable settings, such as overall scale, noise scale, tile scale, roughness, and bump strengths. The instructor provides a detailed step-by-step process, including setting up the 3D scene, adding lighting, and using the Node Wrangler add-on for efficiency. The tutorial also covers grouping nodes into a custom shader and adding controls for easy adjustments. The video concludes with information on purchasing the material and supporting the instructor through Gumroad, Patreon, and YouTube memberships.","In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural tile floor material in Blender. And also after we create the procedural material, I'm going to show you how to turn this material into this custom node with all of these different settings. And all of these settings are also right over here on the side panel. So we have the overall scale to scale the entire material. We also just have the noise scale and just the tile scale. Then there's also a roughness value to make it more shiny or rough. And then there's also tile bump to change the bump of the tile and noise bump as well. And making these custom procedural material nodes is something that I plan on doing from now on in the future in all of my procedural tutorials. If you'd like to purchase this material and also help support me and this channel, I will have links in the description to where you can purchase this material on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. You can also purchase more of my materials by checking out my Blender procedural material packs. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can also check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. All the links are in the description. So before we start, I thought I'd show you the 3D setup if you want to set it up the same way that I have. Or you can add this object really onto any object, like a floor object. So what I did is press Shift-A, I went to Mesh, and I added an Icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click on the Add Icosphere Settings, I just turned the subdivisions up to 6 so that it is very smooth. And then I shaded the object smooth. And then I also rotated this object over on the X-axis by 90 degrees. And that way you'll be able to see the tiles on this side instead of the top. And then I also pressed Shift-A, and I went here to Mesh, and I added a plane. And I just scaled the plane up pretty big and brought it down. And then after I scaled the plane, I pressed Ctrl-A, and I just applied the scale. And then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. Now for the lighting, I added in this Machineshop 02. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Links in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So once you download the HDRI, you can go over here to the World Properties. And you can click on the New button to add a new world if you don't already have a new world. And then right here on Color, you can click on the yellow dot. And you can choose Environment Texture under Texture. And then you can click on the Open button and open up the HDRI. And then also down here on the Strength of the HDRI, I just turned this to a 0.8, so it's a bit less strong. And then I also pressed Shift-A, and I went down here to Light, and I added the Area Light. And then once you add the Area Light, I turned the shape to Rectangle. And I turned up the Size Y and the Size X to make it very long. And then also right here on the Color, I made it a very, very slight yellow color, so it's a little bit warm. And also on the Power here, I turned this to 400. And that way, we get some nice, bright lighting shining on the objects. Now also, if you go right up here to the Render Properties, if you want to make the background transparent so you can't see the HDRI in the background, then you can open up the Film tab here, and you can checkmark the Transparent button just so that you can't see the HDRI in the background. But it's still going to light the scene. And then also to make the colors a bit nicer, right here on the Color Management, I turned the View Transform to Filmic. And the Look here, I turned to Very High Contrast just to pop out the colors and make everything look nicer. And then I'm in the Shading workspace, so I have the 3D viewport right here, and I'm in the Rendered view. And then I have the Shader Editor right here. So I'm just going to click on the New button to add a new material, and I can rename this material to Tile Floor. And then I can just click right here, and I can drag and drop this material onto the other object. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit, and you can go to the Preferences. And then over there on the Add-ons tab, you can search for Node Wrangler, and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, I want to make a base texture for the tiles. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the Search, and I can search for the Musgrave texture. Let's stick the Musgrave texture right here. And then I can Control-Shift and select the Musgrave texture. That's using the feature of the Node Wrangler, and it's going to preview the node on the object. And then also with the Musgrave texture selected, I'm going to press Control-T, that's using another feature of the Node Wrangler, and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I want to use the object coordinates, so let's put the object into the vector of the mapping, and the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the objects more evenly. And then this mapping node can be used to scale the entire material. So we're going to plug all the textures up to the mapping node, and then we can change the scale of the mapping, and that'll change the texture size. So now let's change some of the Musgrave texture settings, because I want to make it more detailed. So I'm going to turn the scale to like a 2.5, I think that is pretty good, and then I'm going to turn the detail all the way to the max of 15, so you can see now it has much more detail. And then to make it even more detailed, I can turn the dimension all the way to 0, and now it is very grainy, and that looks a lot better, it has way more detail. So I can now take the height, and we can put the height into the base color of the principled shader, and then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader. Now I want to change the colors because I want to make this look more brown, so I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I can search for a color ramp. And I want to put the color ramp in between the Musgrave and the principled. So we can now change the colors of the color ramp to change the actual color of the material. So if I click on this white tab here, I want to click on this color, and I want to make this kind of just like a dark brown color, not super saturated. And then this color right here, if you click on the black tab, I want to make this kind of like a light brown, so it's going to be a bit brighter, but not too bright. And if you want to use the same colors that I'm using, then right over here on this side, this color is going to be a hex value of 3F2819. So you can punch that in if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using. And then right over here on this tab, if you click on the color here, if you want to use the same value that I'm using, you can punch in a hex value of 564839. That's the exact color that I'll be using. So that is looking pretty cool. Now I want to add a little bit more variation to this texture. So I'm going to press Shift-A, I'm going to go here to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And we want to put the noise texture underneath the Musgrave. And then let's take the mapping vector, and I can put the vector into the vector of the noise texture, and then I can Control-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So we can now change the noise texture settings. So I'm first going to turn the scale value to 3, and then I also want to make it very detailed, so let's turn the detail all the way to the max of 15, so it's more detailed. And then also the roughness here, I'm going to turn that to 0.7, so it is even more detailed. So I now want to take the noise texture, and I want to combine it with the base color that we already have. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the Mix node. And I want to bring the Mix node right up here. And if you're using older versions of Blender, then this is the Mix RGB node, but in the new version of Blender 3.4 and future versions, this is now just the Mix node. But it'll work exactly the same whether you're using the Mix RGB or the Mix node. Now right here on the Mix node, we're using color values, so I want to click on the float here, and I'm going to instead change this to color. And then I want to drop the Mix node right here between the ColorRamp and the Principled shader. So just drop it right there. And then I want to take the noise texture factor, and I want to put that into the factor of the Mix here. And then I can Control-Shift and select the Mix node to preview it. So the factor is going to determine where it's going to be color A and where it's going to be color B. And again, if you're using the Mix RGB node, A and B is just renamed to color 1 and color 2, but it works exactly the same. So right here on color B, we can click on this and we can make it any color that we want. So I want to make it kind of like a light brown color. Now you can see it's kind of affecting the entire material, and that is because this noise texture isn't very contrasty. So I want to make the noise texture more contrasty before it goes into the factor. So I'm going to click on this ColorRamp right here, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it. And I'm going to stick it in between the noise texture and the factor. And then if I select the ColorRamp, I can hit the backspace, and that's going to reset the ColorRamp. So I can now drag these two tabs together, and that's going to make it more contrasty. And to see what it's doing, I can Control-Shift and select the ColorRamp to preview it. So you can see that as I drag these values together, the black is getting darker and the white is getting lighter. So I'm going to drag the black tab to about here, and then the white tab to about there. And then I can Control-Shift and select the Mix node to preview it. So now you can see it's much more contrasty. So I can now click on color B, and I can change this to whatever color that I want. So I'm going to make this kind of an orangey color, but then make it dark. And the hex value that I'm using for color B is going to be a hex value of 58442D. So now if I Control-Shift and select the ColorRamp, and Control-Shift and select the Mix, and go back and forth, you can see it's adding a bit more variation to the color, and I do like that better. So now I can Control-Shift and select the Principled shader, and I want to bring the material output back. Now I also want the roughness to be slightly different along the texture, because I want some parts to be a little bit more shiny and other parts to be a bit more rough. So I'm going to take the noise texture factor, and I'm going to put that into the roughness of the Principled shader. Now I want to have more control over it, so what I'm going to do is select this ColorRamp right here, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it, and let's put this ColorRamp in between the noise texture and the Principled shader. And then I can hit the backspace to reset the ColorRamp. So we can now drag the values around, and we can change these colors to change how rough the material is. So I'm going to click on the black tab, and I'm going to click on the color, and I'm going to make this a bit brighter. And you can see as I turn it up, if the colors are lighter, it's going to make the tiles more rough. So I'm just going to make it kind of like a mid-gray color, or a bit darker. And if you want to use the same hex value that I'm using for this gray color, I'm going to use a hex value of 333333. So this material is looking pretty cool, but we don't have the tile pattern, so let's now make the tile pattern. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the wave texture. And let's put the wave texture underneath the noise texture. And then again, I want this mapping node to be able to control the entire scale of the material, so we want to put the vector into the vector of the wave texture. And then I can Control-Shift and select the wave texture to preview it. Now if you click here on the bands direction, I want to change this instead to Y, so that the bands are going in the opposite direction. And then I'm actually going to leave all of the other settings at the default. Now to make this actually look like tiles, we need another wave texture which is going in the opposite direction. So I'm going to click on the wave texture, and I'm going to press Control-Shift-D. So Control-Shift-D will duplicate the node, but it'll keep the wires plugged up, and that way the mapping node is still plugged up to the wave texture. And then this one, if I Control-Shift and select it to preview it, I want to change the Y instead back to X, so that it is going in the opposite direction. And I'll leave the other settings at the default. Now I do want to be able to change the size of the wave textures to change the tile size, but I don't want to scale the scale values on this mapping node, because that's also going to change the scale of the Musgrave and Noise. So I want to put another mapping node here before the wave textures. So what I'm going to do is select this mapping node, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it. And I'm going to stick it here in the wire going between the mapping to one of the wave textures. And then I want to take the vector of the mapping, and I want to put that into the other wave texture. So now this mapping node is just controlling the size of these wave textures. Now before I change the size of the waves, I want to join them together, because right now they're not actually joined together, they are both separate. So I'm going to press Shift-A, I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for the mix node. And let's drop the mix node here. And then we are working with color values, so I want to click on the float here, and I instead want to change that to color. And then I can take both of the wave texture colors, and I want to put that into A. And this wave texture, I want to put that into B. And then I want to Control-Shift and select the mix node to preview it. Now I just want to add the dark values, because the dark values are the stripes of the waves. So on the mix node here, I can click on this mix, and I can change the type to darken instead. And then right here on the factor, that's going to control how much it's using. So if I turn the factor up, it's going to add more and more of the texture. So I'm going to turn the factor all the way up to 1, so it is using both of the dark values of the wave texture. And now you can see that looks like tiles. So now if I go back here to the mapping node behind the wave textures, I can change the scale, because right now these are way too small. So on the mapping scale, I'm going to click on the X, and then I'm going to drag down, and then I can drag back and forth, and this will change both values at the same time. And I actually want to type in a specific number, so I'm going to click, drag down, and then let go. And I'm going to change this to a 0.17, just a 0.17, I think that is a pretty good size. Alright, so I now want to take the darken here, and I want to put that into the normal to give the material some bump. So let's take the result here from the darken, and I'm going to put that into the normal. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now you can see it's not really doing anything, it has these little dark areas, and that is because this is color data, but then this is normal data. So we need a node in here to convert the color data into normal data that the material can use. So I'm going to press shift A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the bump node. And let's put the bump node in between the darken and the normal. And then I want to take the result here, and I want to put that into the height value. And that way it's going to convert it to normal data, so you can now see it looks like we have all these little bumpy pyramids. Now I want to make the edges more contrasty, because I don't want them to be bumpy all along here, I just want them to be bumpy where the end of the tiles are. So to make it more contrasty, I'm going to press shift A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the map range node. Let's click on the map range, and I'm going to put the map range in between the darken and the bump. And then I can control shift and select the map range to preview it. So if you zoom in here, you can see there's some gray values, and so that's what's causing that pyramid shape. So what I can do is change the map range values, and then that'll make the colors more contrasty. So if I hold down the shift key, I can drag the from max, and you can see if I drag this down, it's going to make it much more contrasty. And I'm going to turn the from max to a specific value of 0.002. So just 0.002, and then hit enter, and you can see now it is very, very small. And then I also want to turn the to max up, and if I turn the to max up, it's going to brighten up those light values and make it even stronger. So I'm going to turn the to max to a value of 11. So now if I zoom out here, you can see that those edges in the tiles are very, very small. So if I now control shift and select the bump, you can see it's just going to be bumpy in those little areas. So I can now control shift and select the principal shader, and you can now see we have a really nice tile pattern. Now I also want to add just a little bit more bump over the entire surface. So I'm going to click on this bump node, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it, and let's stick it here after the first bump. So the normal can go through the normal, but we now have this other height value that we can add data into. So I want to take the noise texture factor here. I want to put the wire into the height of this new bump, and that's going to convert to normal data, and so this way we can mix multiple bump maps together. Now that is way too strong, so I'm going to turn the strength way down to make the tile much more smooth. And I'm going to use a strength value of 0.07 on the bump. So now if you kind of zoom in closely, you can see it is bumpy, but it is much more subtle. And then one more thing that I forgot to do, the roughness isn't very contrasty, and I do want to make it a bit more contrasty so that some parts are a little bit more rough and other parts are a bit more shiny. So I'm just going to drag this gray tab out a bit, and so you can see it's more contrasty now. So I'll just drag it to about there, something like that. And there we have it, so there is the procedural tile material. So if you want to end the tutorial here, you can, but I'm now going to show you how to group this into a custom node and add different values that you can change to change the procedural material. So what I'm going to do is click and drag, and that's going to add a box select, and I'm just going to box select all the nodes except the material output. So with all the nodes selected, I can press Ctrl-G, and Ctrl-G is going to join them together into a group, and then you can press the Tab key to go in and out of the group if the group is selected. So I'll press the Tab key to go out of the group. I can just bring this up here and then kind of zoom into it. And right here, if I make this bigger, I'm going to make this pretty big. We have a name here, so I'm going to rename this to Tile Floor. Now, we don't have any custom values, so I want to add some custom values to this shader. So I'm going to select the Tile Floor group, and I will press Tab to edit the shader. And you can see right over here, it's added a group input. And so we can plug values into the group input, and then that'll show up on the shader. So I'm first going to take this first mapping. I'm going to take the scale and put that into the group input. So now, if I press the Tab key to go out of it, you can see we have X, Y, and Z values. But I just want one value to change the entire scale at once. So with the Tile Floor selected, I'm going to press the Tab key again, and I want to turn this into a single value. So I'm going to press the N key to open up the side panel, and then I'm going to click right here on the group tab. And you can see there are inputs and there are outputs. And also on the outputs right here, you could leave this to BSDF, but I want to double-click on this to rename this, and I'm just going to rename this to Shader because I think that's a bit nicer. So that way, if I press the Tab key, you can see this now says Shader. So I will press the Tab key to go back into the group. So right here on the inputs, we have a scale value, and I'm going to click on this. Now, if you want to rename it, you can, but to make it one single value, I don't want it to be a vector type. So on the type here, I'm going to change this instead to Float. And Float is going to be a single value. Now, when I do that, you can see it kind of gets rid of the entire material, and that's because, on default, it's set to zero. So we basically scaled the entire material way down. So I can press the Tab key to go back out of it. And then right here on the scale value, I can turn this back to what it was, which was one. So change that to one, and now I can change the scale value, and that'll change the entire scale of the material. So I can now press the Tab key to go back into the group. So if I go back here to the group input, I can add extra values into the socket to control more values. So another value that I want to control is the noise scale. So right here on this noise texture, let's take the scale, and I can put that right in here to the extra slot. And then right up here on the inputs, I can rename this. So I'm going to double-click on it, and I'm going to rename this to Noise Scale. I also want to be able to change the tile scale. So right here on the mapping, we can change this scale value here to change the tile scale. So let's take the scale here from this second mapping. We can put that into the socket. And then right here, if we click on this, we can double-click on it to rename it. And I'm going to rename it to Tile Scale. And then right now, you can see it's a purple dot because it is vector. But I want to click on the type here, and I want to change this just to float so that it is a single value. And then you can see it goes away. You can see the tiles that have disappeared. That's because it changes it back to zero. So if you just unplug the scale here, you can see the value was 0.17. So on the tile scale, I can put this back up to the scale, and then I can press the Tab key, and the tile scale was 0.17. And now you can see that the tiles are back. So I can now click on the group and press the Tab key again. Now, I also want to be able to change the roughness. But if you go right up here to the color ramp, you can see there aren't any values that we can put here into the group input because this is a color ramp. So instead, we can add a node in here to change the light values and dark values, and then that'll change the amount of roughness. So I can press Shift-A, I'm going to go to the search, and I can search for the hue saturation value node. And let's put the hue saturation value in between the color ramp and the principal. So right now, it's not doing anything on default, and that's what we want. If I Control-Shift and select the hue saturation value, we can change this value, and the value is going to make it lighter or darker. And if the values are lighter and darker, it's going to be more rough or more shiny. So I'm going to Control-Shift and select the principal shader again. And what I want to do is take the value from the hue saturation value, and I want to bring that all the way over and stick it into the socket here. And then if you click on this to change the name, I'm going to rename it to Roughness. And then I also want to be able to control the strengths. So I want to take the first bump, and I want to bring a wire out from the strength, and I'm going to drag all the way over, put this in here, and then right here, I can click on this to rename this, and I'm going to rename it to Tile Bump Strength. And then if you go back here, we have this one here. So I'm going to take the strength, and I'm going to drag this all the way over, and I'm going to put this into this socket here. And then this one is going to be Noise Bump Strength. Noise Bump Strength. And that is it. Those are all the values that I'm going to add. So I can now press the Tab key to go out of the group, and you can see we have the temporary viewer. So to get rid of that, you can just Control-Shift and select the shader, and that'll get rid of it. So now I can change the scale. That'll change the overall size. I can also change the noise scale and the tile scale. Also the roughness. You can see if I turn this up or down, it's going to make it more rough or more shiny. And then we also have the Tile Bump Strength and the Noise Bump Strength. So there we go. That is how you turn this into a customizable procedural material. And as I mentioned at the starting of this video, I do plan on doing this from now on in all of my future procedural material tutorials because it makes the material a bit more easier to use and a bit more useful.

The tutorial covers setting up the environment with HDRI lighting, creating a lava shader with a noise texture and emission, and a rock shader with a noise texture and bump mapping. The tutorial also explains how to combine these shaders using a Voronoi texture for a realistic effect and concludes with rendering tips. The creator offers the material for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon and mentions their procedural material packs available online.","In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural rocky lava material in Blender. If you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this material, then you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description. And as you may know, I do create a lot of procedural materials, and so every time I create another 10 procedural materials, I compile them together into a procedural material pack. And so I've just recently released Blender Procedural Material Pack number 12. So if you'd like to purchase any of my procedural material packs, I'll have a link in the description where you can purchase on my Gumroad store. And I'm also selling all of my procedural material packs on the Blender market as well as some other online marketplaces. And you can also get access to all of my procedural materials if you join my Patreon page. Or if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can also check out my Blender Procedural Material Tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D space if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I want to preview the material on a sphere. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go here to Mesh, and I'm just going to add an Icosphere. And then right after you add the Icosphere, right behind me, if you click on the Add Icosphere Settings, just open that up, I turn the subdivisions to 6 because I want a very nice smooth sphere, and I also want lots of topology because we are going to be using the displacements in the Node Editor to actually displace the rock. So I'm going to set the subdivisions to 6, and then I can close this. And then using the Object Context menu, I can shade the object smooth. Now I want this to be much closer to the real-life scale in Blender, and the default primitive objects are about an average human height. So I'm going to hit S to scale, then I'm going to type 0.5, and then Enter. And that way, this sphere is about half the size of a human. And then with this object selected, I can press Ctrl-A, and I can apply the scale, so this is now the object's new default size. And then using the Object Context menu, you can also shade the object smooth. Then I also added a camera, and I just pointed the camera at the sphere. Now for the lighting, I added in this Skylit Garage HDRI, and this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. I'll have a link in the description if you'd like to download it. And I just downloaded the 1K HDR version from Polyhaven. So once you've downloaded the HDRI, you can go to the World Properties, and you can click here on Color, click on the yellow dot, and you can choose Environment Texture, and then you can click on the Open button and open up the downloaded HDRI. And this is going to give us some nice, realistic lighting and reflections on the object. And then also, if you want to make the background transparent like I have, if you go up here to the Render Properties and open up the Film tab, you can checkmark the Transparent button, and that way you can't see the HDRI in the background. And then also, to make the colors a little bit nicer, if you open up the Color Management here, you can set the View Transform to Filmic, and on the look here, I'm going to set this to High Contrast, and this will pop out the colors and make everything more contrasty and saturated. Now, as I mentioned, I am going to be using the displacements in the Node Editor, so if you want to use the Node Editor displacements, then you will need to be using the Cycles rendering engine, because the Node Editor displacements aren't supported in Blender Eevee. So make sure you're using Cycles if you want to use the displacements. Now, this sphere is already pretty high detail, but I want to give it even more geometry so that it has more detail for the displacements. So if you click right over here on the Modifier Properties, I'm going to click on Add Modifier, and I'm going to add the Subdivision Surface Modifier. And so this will subdivide the mesh and give it even more geometry. And then right here on the Levels viewport and Renderer, I'm going to turn these both up to 2. And then I'm in the Shading workspace, and I have the 3D viewport right here, and I'm in the Rendered mode, so I can preview the material, and then I also have the Shader Editor right here. So I'm just going to click on New to add a new material, and I can just rename the material. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit, and then you can go to the Preferences, and then over there in the Add-ons tab, just search for Node Wrangler, and you can checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So we're going to be creating two different shaders. We're going to be creating a Lava shader and a Rock shader, and then we're going to join the two shaders together and add the displacement. So first, let's create the Lava. So I want to create a texture for the Lava, so I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the Search, and I'm going to search for the Noise Texture, and let's drop the Noise Texture down here. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the Noise Texture to preview it. And that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler, so if you hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and select different nodes, it's going to preview the node on the object. And then also, with the Noise Texture selected, I'm going to press Ctrl-T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now, we don't actually need the mapping node, so I can just select the mapping node and then press X to delete it. And then I want to use the object coordinates, so let's take the object and put that into the vector. And the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the object more evenly. So now let's change some of the Noise Texture settings. So on the scale here, I'm going to turn this up to, like, 10, so you can see more of the texture. And then I'm also going to turn the detail all the way to the max of 15, so there's more detail. And then I also want to give it a bit more roughness, so there's even more detail. So I'm going to turn the roughness to, like, a 0.8. Now, this is a hot liquid lava, and so I want to make it a bit more like liquid and make it look like it's moving around. So to do that, I'm going to turn up the distortion. So I'm going to turn the distortion to just, like, a 0.5, and now it looks a bit more like a liquid, which is moving around. So I can now take the Noise Texture factor, and I want to put that into the emission so that it is actually going to be emitting light, like hot lava. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the Principled shader. Now, I want to make the base color so that it's not interfering with the emission color. So I can take the base color, and I can turn that to fully black. And then right here on the emission strength, I want to make this brighter, so I'm going to turn the emission strength to, like, a 5, so it's much brighter. Now, that doesn't look like lava, and that's because it's very white. So I want to change the colors in the Noise Texture before putting it into the emission. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the color ramp, and let's put the color ramp in between the Noise Texture and the emission. So we can now change the colors of the color ramp to change the colors of the lava. So I first want to make it more contrasty because I can't really see the texture. So I'm going to click on the black tab here, and I'm going to drag this out, and if I drag it over, now it's much more contrasty. And then I'm going to click on this color, and I'm going to make it fully white, and then I'm going to make it a very bright red color for the lava. And then also right here, if you click on the white tab, this color, I want to click on the color, and I'm going to make this kind of a yellowish-orangish color, something like that. Now, I also want the lava to be pretty shiny, so let's take the roughness right here, and I'm just going to turn the roughness to a 0.2. So now if you look right up here, you can see there's that reflection, and it is much more shiny. Now, this lava is very smooth, and so I want to put some data into the normal to give it some bump. So let's take the factor, and I'm going to put that into the normal of the principled shader. Now, we need to convert this to normal data because this is black and white data. It is a gray dot, but then this normal data is a purple dot. So to convert it to normal data, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the bump node, and I want to put the bump node in between the noise texture and the normal. And let's take the factor, and I'm going to put that into the height value of the bump. And then it is pretty hard to see because it's in Emission, but let's just Control-Shift and select the bump to preview it. And I want to take the strength here, and I just want to turn it to like a 0.5 so that it is not quite as bumpy. So now I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And that is it for the Lava shader. So what I'm going to do is just click and drag to box select all these nodes here, and then I can press Control-J. And that is going to join them together into a frame. And then if you click on the frame, you can press F2 to add a node label, and I'm just going to rename this to Lava. It is totally optional. You don't need to add a frame, but I do just want to add a frame to keep my nodes nicely organized. And then I can also drag these together to kind of compress them a bit. So that's the Lava shader. So I now want to make the rock shader down here. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for another principled shader, and let's drop it down here. And then I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now I want to make this shader look like a bumpy rock. So to do that, I'm going to add another noise texture. So let's press Shift-A. I can go to the search, and I'm going to search for the noise texture, and let's drop the noise texture down here. And then I can Control-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And just like we did for the other noise texture, I want to use the object coordinates. So let's drag the texture coordinate down, and then I can put the object into the vector. And the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. So now let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I want to turn the scale to like 10, so that it is smaller. And then let's also turn the detail all the way to the max of 15. And then I do just want to add a little bit more roughness, so it has a bit more detail. So I will turn the roughness to just like a 0.6. And then I do want to add some distortion, but not very much. So I'm just going to turn the distortion to like a 0.2, and that way there's just a tiny bit of distortion. So I can now take the noise texture factor, and I want to put that into the base color of the principled shader. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader. Now that doesn't look like rock, because it is just black and white. So I want to add a color ramp in between the noise texture and the principled to change the colors. So I can press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I can search for the color ramp. And I want to put the color ramp in between the noise texture and the principled. And we can now change the colors here to make it look more like rock. So I'm going to click on the white tab here. And for this white color, I'm going to just make it like a gray color, kind of a mid gray, so it looks more like rock. And then I also want to make this rock look slightly brown. So I'm going to hold down the Ctrl key and then click right here in the center, and that's going to add another tab in the center. And then if I click on this color right here, I want to make this just very slightly brown. So I'm going to bring it over just a little bit towards the orange. And then if we turn this down, it's going to be kind of like a grayish brown. Now this still doesn't look very much like rock, and that is because it is very smooth. So I want to take the factor here. I'm going to bring out a wire and put that into the normal of the principled shader to give it some bump. Now we have some weird shading issues, and it's very dark right there. And that is because we need to convert the black and white data into normal data that the shader can use. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the bump node. Now let's put the bump node in between the noise texture and the normal. And then to actually convert to normal data, we want the factor to be going into the height value. So now it actually looks much more like rock. Now it is a bit strong, so I'm just going to take the strength here, and I'm going to turn it down to like a 0.3, so it's not quite as strong. So there we go, there is the procedural rock. So I'm just going to click and drag to box select all these nodes here, and then I can press Ctrl-J. And Ctrl-J is going to join them together into a frame. And I'm just going to kind of bring these in to compress them a little bit, make them a little bit more compact. And then if you click on the frame, you can press F2 to add a label. And I'm just going to rename this to rock, just to keep my nodes nicely organized. So I can now Ctrl-Shift and select the two different shaders, and we have the lava shader and the rock shader. So I now want to join them together. So I'm going to select the principled shader, then I'm going to hold down the Shift key and select the other shader. I can now press Ctrl-0. And Ctrl-0 is going to add this mix shader, and it's going to join both of them together. And I can just box select these nodes and kind of bring it into the center. Now the factor is going to control how much of each shader it's using. So if I turn the factor all the way up to 1, it's just using the rock. Or if I bring the factor all the way to 0, it's just using the lava. But I don't want to evenly blend between the two shaders. I want there to be some chunky parts which are the rock, but then I want the rest to be the lava. So to do this, we're going to be creating another node setup here in the center. And we're going to be putting the node setup into the factor to control where it's going to be rock and lava. So I'm going to drag these two frames out of the way a little bit, so there's some more space here in the center. So the first thing I'm going to do is press Shift-A. I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture. And let's drop the Voronoi texture right down here. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it. Now to make the Voronoi texture look like chunks of rock, I'm going to click on the F1 here and I'm going to change it to distance to edge. So you can see these white parts here, that is where the chunks of rock are going to be popping out of the lava. But then these black lines here, that is where the lava is going to be. Now I also want to use the object coordinates just like with these other textures. So I'm going to take the object and let's put that into the vector of the Voronoi. And then I also want to scale the Voronoi texture. So I'm going to turn the Voronoi scale to like a 2.25. I just find that a 2.25 looks pretty good. Now right now those chunks of rock are pretty large, but what we're going to be doing is adding a noise texture in the vector to distort the placement of the Voronoi. And then they will look smaller. And I also want to add a noise texture in here to distort it, because right now these black lines are very smooth and they don't look very organic or natural. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the noise texture. And let's put the noise texture in between the object coordinate and the Voronoi. And so if I put this in here, it's going to distort the placement of the Voronoi, and now it looks much more random. So let's also change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to like a 6, so that it is a bit smaller. And then I want to give it lots of detail, so let's turn the detail all the way to the max of 15. And that is looking a lot better. Now it's distorting it way too much, and I can't really see what the original Voronoi texture looked like. It's just distorting it a lot. And so I want to make the noise texture have less control over the vector of the Voronoi. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the mix node. And let's just drop the mix node right up here. And I actually need to take the lava shader and bring it up so there's a bit more space. And then I can bring the mix right over here. Now if you're using an older version of Blender, this is the mix RGB node instead. So if you're using an older version of Blender, you can follow along and just use the mix RGB. Or if you're using Blender 3.4 or a later version, you can add just the mix node. Now we want to use color values, because right here this noise texture, it is using a color value. So let's click on the float here, and I'm going to change this instead to color. And then I can drop the mix node in between the noise texture and the Voronoi. So now what I can do is I can mix the noise texture with the original object coordinates. So I'm going to take the noise texture, and I'm going to put that into B. And let's take the object, and I'm going to put that into A. And again, if you're using the mix RGB node, A and B is just going to be renamed to color 1 and color 2. But it'll still work exactly the same. So now this factor is going to control how much of A it's using and how much of B it's using. So as I turn up the factor, it's going to be distorting it more and more. Now you can see when I drag the factor, it's moving the texture around a lot. So to make it so it's not being moved around quite as much, I'm going to click on this mix here, and I'm going to change the mix instead to the linear light. So this way I can drag the factor, and it's still going to distort the Voronoi, but it's not going to move the texture around quite as much. And then I have found that a factor of 0.7 looks pretty good, so it is still distorting it a lot, but it's not distorting it quite as much. So where the white parts are, that's where the rock is going to be popping out of the lava, and then where the black parts are, that's where the lava is going to be. So I can now take the distance, and I can put the distance into the factor of the mix shader, and then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the mix shader to preview it. Now right now it's just the lava, and that is because this Voronoi texture isn't very contrasty. So to make it more contrasty, I can press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I can search for the color ramp, and I want to put the color ramp in between the Voronoi and the factor. And so I can now click on the white tab, and I can drag the white tab over, and as I drag it over, it's going to make the light parts brighter, and so where the white parts are, that is where the rock is going to be. So if you want lots of rock, you can drag this way over, and you can see now it's mostly rock, or if you want to be mostly lava, you can drag this way back, and just have a few bits of rock here and there. I want to bring this over so that it is about here, so that there are some big chunks of rock, but then there's lava all around it. Now the rock isn't actually being popped out of the mesh. If you look here on the side, you can see it's very smooth. And so I want to put a value into the displacement of the material output, so that the rocks are actually being displaced, and they're popping out of the mesh. So I'm going to take the Voronoi texture distance, and I'm going to put that into the displacement of the material output. So now you can see it is doing something, and the rock looks like it's kind of popping back in, but it's not actually working correctly, and it's not actually displacing the mesh, because on the edge here, you can see it still is smooth. And that's because we need to convert this black and white distance value into displacement data. So to do that, I can press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the displacement node, and I want to put the displacement in between the Voronoi and the distance. And I can just drag it right down here, underneath the mix shader. And then you can see it's still not doing anything, but that's because I want the distance value to be going into the height value of the displacement. And as I mentioned at the beginning of this tutorial, if you're using Blender EB, then the node editor displacements won't work, the node editor displacements only work in the Cycles rendering engine, so make sure you're using Cycles if you want to use the displacements. Now you can see it is doing something, the rock does appear as though it's popping out, but again, if you look here on the edges, you can see it's not actually displacing the mesh. And that is because we need to tell the material that it can use the displacements. So if you bring out the side panel, and click right over here to the material properties, I want to open up the settings tab here in the material settings. So in the displacement settings under surface, the displacement right now is set to bump only, and so it does make it look like it's bumping out of the mesh, but it's not actually using the displacement. So let's take this setting, and we're going to turn it to displacement and bump. And this is telling the material that it can use the displacements. So now you can see that it is actually displacing the mesh, and it looks very spiky. Now that is way too strong, so I'm just going to hold down the shift key and then drag the scale value, and that's going to make my movements more sensitive, and I can just make it much more subtle. And so now you can see that it is actually displacing the mesh. And I found that a scale value of 0.04 looks pretty good. So you can change that to 0.04 if you want to use the same value. Now if you look here on the edges of the displacement, you can see it's not very clear where the rock is and where the lava is, because I want the rock to be popping out a lot, but then I don't want the lava to be popping out at all. So to fix this, we need to make it more contrasty. But I don't want to use this color ramp, because if I put the color into the height value of the displacement, you can see that doesn't look very good at all. The rock is very flat, and it's also popping out way too much, and also some parts of the lava are popping out. So I'm going to take the distance from the Voronoi and put that back into the height. So I'm now going to click on this color ramp right here, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it, and let's stick it in between the Voronoi and the displacement. And then with this color ramp selected, I can hit the backspace, and that is going to reset the color ramp. And then to preview it a little bit better and to actually see what it's doing, I'm going to control shift and select the color ramp. So if we bring the white tab out, it's going to make the light parts brighter, and where the light parts are, the mesh is going to be popping out. But then the black parts are going to be going back in. So if I drag the black tab over, the mesh will be going back in, but then if I bring the white tab over, the rock will be popping out. So we can use this to control the strength of the displacement. So I just want to bring the white tab back a little bit, because I don't want the rock to be popping out quite that much. So I'll bring the white tab to about here, and then I can also bring the black tab to somewhere about there. So I can now control shift and select the mix shader to preview the final material. And that is looking really nice. So I'll just give this a final render. And there is the final render. Now you can see that my final render has a little bit of glow, so to add that glow to the lava, I went over to the compositing tab, and in the compositor, I added these two glare nodes. And the glare nodes will give that little glow to the final render. So that's it for this tutorial, so I hope you found this helpful, and thank you for watching.

The tutorial involves setting up a 3D scene with a cylinder mesh to resemble a biscuit, then using various Blender tools and techniques to apply textures and lighting for a realistic appearance. The process includes manipulating nodes, adding noise, adjusting colors, and using displacement for texture. The video also includes promotional content, encouraging viewers to support the channel through purchasing project files on Gumroad or Patreon, and highlights additional resources such as procedural material packs and tutorial playlists.","In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural biscuit material in Blender. If you'd like to help support the channel and purchase the project files, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description. You can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my materials. And to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, you can also check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist. So let me just show you how I set up the 3D scene. So I press Shift-A, I went here to Mesh, and I added a cylinder. And then the default cube and the other default objects are about an average human height within the real-life scale in Blender. So what I'm going to do is scale this object, and I'm going to type in 0.1 and Enter. And this way the biscuit will be much closer to the real-life scale. And then I will press Ctrl-A, and I'm going to apply the scale, and that way this is now the object's new default scale. Then I'm going to press the Tab key to go into edit mode, and I'm going to select everything. And I'm going to scale everything, and I'm going to scale it on the Z axis. And I'm going to type in 0.2 and Enter, so that the biscuit is much more thin. Then I'm going to press the 3 on the top of my keyboard to go to the face select. I'm going to select this face, and I'm going to hit E to extrude, and then S to scale. And I'll do that a few more times, so E to extrude, just extrude it up a little bit, and then scale it down. And E to extrude, and S to scale, just kind of adding more geometry. And why I'm adding all of this geometry is because I'm going to be using the displacements in the node editor to actually displace the mesh. And so we do need some geometry for the displacements to use. And then I can also hold down the Alt key and select this loop right here. And then what I'm going to do is click right here to turn on the proportional editing, and I can press G to grab. I can bring it up on the Z axis, and I can also scroll my scroll wheel and scroll it way down so that the proportional editing is smaller. And I can just bring that up a little bit, so something like that. Then what I can also do is hold down the Alt key and select that loop of vertices there. And I can press Ctrl B just to give the edge a bevel there. And then also right in here, I'm going to press Ctrl R to add a loop cut. I can left-click and then right-click so it stays in the center. And also Ctrl R to add a loop cut, and left-click and right-click so it stays in the center. And then I also want to press the 3 on the top of my keyboard to go back to the face select, and I'm going to select this face. And I'm going to press I to inset, and I'm just going to scale this way down, place it there. But then I want to merge these together so that there's just one vertex in the center. So I'm going to press the M key, and then I'm going to merge at center. And now we just have one vertex there in the very center. And then also right down here on the bottom of the biscuit, I want to add a bit more geometry. So let's click right here to the face select, or you can press the 3 on the top of your keyboard. And I'm just going to select this face here, and I'll press the I key to inset that, place that there, and inset that a few more times. So just hit the I key to inset and add a bit more geometry. All right, I can press the Tab key to go back to object mode. And then right over here on the modifier properties, I want to give this a subdivision surface modifier to smooth it out. So let's click on Add Modifier, and under Generate, I can add the subdivision surface. And then I want to turn the viewport and render levels both up to 3 so that it has much more geometry. And then using the object context menu, I can shade this object smooth. And then I also want to sharpen up this bottom edge here on the bottom of the biscuit. So I'll press the Tab key to go into edit mode, and I can press Ctrl R to add a loop cut. And I'm going to click and then drag down and place it there just so that that edge is a bit sharper. So something like that, just some simple modeling for the biscuit. And then in object mode, I can press Shift A, and I can go down here and add a camera. And then I can just navigate to where I want the camera to be, and I can press Ctrl Alt Numpad 0. Ctrl Alt Numpad 0 will bring the camera to where we are. And then with the camera selected, you can press G to grab. You can hold down the Shift key to make your movements more sensitive and just move the camera around. And also right over here on the object data properties here on the camera, I want to turn the focal length up to 80. And this way, it'll make everything look a bit more flat, and I do think that looks better. And I can also press the G key to grab, and then I can double tap the Z key, and this will bring the camera in and out. So I'll just place the camera about there. And then if I hold down the Z button and go up into the rendered view, you can see that the lighting isn't very nice. And so I'm going to be adding in an HDRI to get some nice realistic lighting. So right here on the world properties, right here on the surface, if you click on the yellow dot next to color, you can choose the environment texture. And then you can click on the Open button and open up an HDRI. And I'm going to be adding in the Machineshop 02 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. I'll have the links in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K HDR version. So I'm just going to double click on this to open it up. And then right here on the strength, I'm going to turn the strength to a 0.8 so that the HDRI is a little bit less strong. Now to make the colors look a bit nicer, I'm going to go right here to the Render Properties. And I'm going to open up the Color Management tab. And I'm going to use the View Transform of Filmic. And then on the look here, I'm going to change this to Very High Contrast. And this will pop out the colors and make everything more contrasty and saturated. And also, if you don't want to see the HDRI in the background, you can open up the Film tab right here. And you're going to checkmark the Transparent. And that way the background will be transparent, but it will still add lighting to the scene. And then also, I am doing this in Cycles Render. And I definitely would recommend doing this in Cycles because I am trying to make this look very realistic. And also, I'm going to be using the displacements in the Node Editor. And the Node Editor displacements only work in Cycles. They don't work in Eevee. So I would recommend using Cycles. Now, I actually want to rotate the HDRI light around because right now, it's kind of blown out. And the lighting is actually going to look pretty flat. So I want to rotate the HDRI around because I found that the lighting looks better if it's coming at a different angle. So what I'm going to do is click right here to go to the Shading workspace. And then I have the Shader nodes right here and the 3D viewport over here. And I'm going to go into the Rendered view. And then to edit the World nodes, we can click here on Object on the Shader Editor. And we can change this to World instead. Now, I'm going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit and you can go to the Preferences. And then over there in the Add-ons tab, you can just search for Node Wrangler and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So once the Node Wrangler add-on is turned on, you can select the HDRI here in the World Shader nodes. And you can press Ctrl-T. And that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then we can use this mapping node to rotate around the HDRI because the mapping is going to control where the HDRI is placed. So right here on the rotation, we can rotate the Z value and that's going to rotate the HDRI around. So I'm going to type in negative 90 just to rotate that over by negative 90. And now you can see that there's a bit more contrast. There's kind of some shadow here and the light is kind of coming over at this angle. And that really will make the material look much nicer and you'll be able to see a lot more detail in the material. So I do like that better. And then let's click on World here and I'm going to change this back to Object so that we can edit the object material. So just select the object and then here in the Shader Editor, I'm going to click on New to add a new material. And I can rename the material to Biscuit. So to start off, I want to add a gradient texture because I want the bottom of the biscuit to look a bit darker and make it look like maybe it's a little bit toasted or more cooked. And then I want the top of the biscuit to look a little bit lighter. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the gradient texture and let's put the gradient texture right there. And then because we turned on the Node Wrangler add-on, you can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and then select different nodes and that's going to preview the different nodes on the object. So I'm just going to Ctrl-Shift and select the gradient texture. And you can see the gradient texture is black and then it goes to white. Now, I want to rotate the gradient texture because I want it to be darker on the bottom and then be lighter as it goes up to the top of the biscuit. So with the gradient texture selected, I can press Ctrl-T and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I want to use the object coordinates, so let's put the object into the vector of the mapping. So now I want to rotate the gradient texture around. So I can change the rotation Y and that's going to rotate the gradient. So I'm going to rotate it by 90 degrees and that'll rotate it over. So you can now see it's black here and then it looks a little bit lighter here. Now, it is kind of dark and it is hard to see, so I actually want to bring the gradient texture down. So right here on the location, we rotated the gradient over. So if we take the X location and move that up and down, that is going to move the gradient up and down. So I'm going to turn the X to a 0.025. Just a 0.025, I don't need to move it down very much, but now you can see it's a bit brighter. And then to make it even brighter, I'm going to be using a color ramp. So let's now add a color ramp to control the colors of the gradient. So I can press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the color ramp node. And let's put the color ramp after the gradient texture. And then I can drag the white tab and drag it over, and if it's closer to the black tab, it's going to be more contrasty. And I can also drag this black tab over if I want to, but I'm just going to leave the black tab over there. So now you can see it's lighter up here and then darker down there. Now, I also want to make a noisy texture for the biscuit surface. So I'm going to press Shift-A, I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to start by adding a Voronoi texture, and let's stick the Voronoi here under the color ramp. And then I can Control-Shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it. Now, I actually want to make this pretty small, so I'm just going to turn the scale to 1 here on the Voronoi. But then I want to distort this Voronoi texture with a noise texture. So I can press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the noise texture, and I can put the noise texture underneath the mapping. And I can Control-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Now, you can see there's a bit of stretching on the noise texture on the object here, and so I'm going to use the object coordinates to get rid of the stretching. So I'll put the object into the vector of the noise texture, and that's why we use the object coordinates for the procedural materials, because the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the object more evenly. So now let's change the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale up to, like, a 15 so that we can see more of it, and then I'm also going to turn the detail all the way to the max of 15, so it has much more detail. And let's also turn the roughness up a little bit, so I'm just going to turn the roughness up to, like, a 0.6, and now you can see there's even more detail. So I now want this noise texture to distort the placement of the Voronoi. So I'm going to Control-Shift and select the Voronoi texture, and then what I want to do is I want to take the noise texture factor, and I want to put that into the vector of the Voronoi, because the vector is going to determine the placement of where the texture is. You can see the mapping node is going through the vector, and so it's changing the placement of the gradient, so this noise texture is going to be put into the vector, and so it's going to distort the placement of the Voronoi texture. Now, it is very, very subtle, but if you look closely, there is some lighter areas and some darker areas, but you'll be able to see it better once we mix it with the gradient. So this Voronoi texture has all the noise for the biscuit, but then this gradient here and the color ramp, that's going to make it lighter and darker. So I want to mix these two together. So what I'm going to do is click and drag just to box select these nodes and bring them over so I have a bit more space. So now to mix these two colors together, I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the mix node, and I'll put the mix node right here. Now, in older versions of Blender, there was the mix RGB node, but in the new Blender version of 3.4, the mix RGB node has been changed to just the mix node. So if you're using an older version of Blender, you can just add the mix RGB node, but if you're using Blender 3.4 or a later version, you can just add the mix node. Either way, you can still follow along with the tutorial whether you're using the mix node or the mix RGB node. So on the mix node here, I'm going to click on the float, and I'm going to instead change this to color. And then I want to put the Voronoi distance into socket A, and then I want this color ramp here to be going into socket B. And if you're using the mix RGB node, instead of it saying A and B, it'll be color 1 and color 2, but it'll still act exactly the same. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the mix node to preview it. Now, right here on mix, I want to click on this, and I instead want to change this to the linear light. And now you can see that it's going to be darker on the bottom because of that color ramp, but then on the top here, it's going to be lighter. But you will still be able to see the Voronoi and the noise. And I'm actually going to turn this factor value all the way up to 1 so that we're using much more of the gradient. Now, you can see it looks really black right now. And so to make the gradient less strong, we can edit the color ramp. So if you click on the black tab here on this color ramp before the gradient, I'm going to click on the black color, and I'm going to turn this up. And so if we turn it up, it's going to make the gradient brighter. So now you can see that there's that transition. So it's darker over here, and then it's lighter up here. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using for this color ramp here on the dark color, I'm going to be using a hex value of 72, 72, 72. So you can punch in that hex value if you want to use the same color that I'm using. And then also for this lighter color here on the color ramp, this is going to be a hex value of F1, F1, F1. So you can punch that in here if you want to use the same color. And I'm going to drag this white tab over just a little bit more. So there we go. We now have a really nice black and white texture there for the biscuit. So I now want to take the mix node, and I want to put that into the base color of the principled shader. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now I want to change the colors because this doesn't really look like a biscuit. It doesn't really look like bread. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a color ramp, and we can put the color ramp in between the linear light, the mix node, and the principled shader. So let's put this in between the two nodes. So we can now change the colors of the color ramp, and that'll change the colors. So I'm first going to drag this tab over, and I'm actually going to drag it pretty close. And then I'm going to hold down the control key and click here to add another tab, and I'm going to bring this one over as well. So we're going to be creating three different colors for the biscuit colors. So if I click on the first one here, this white one, this one I'm going to make kind of a peachy color, something like that. And then also this one here in the middle, this one I want to be a brown color. So let's make this kind of an orangey peachy color. And then to make it brown, we can make it a bit darker. So something like that. And then also if you click on the black tab here, this one I also want to be brown, but I want it to be even darker. So let's just make this a very gray color, and then I can bring it towards the orange. So we now have kind of a peachy color or a tannish color. Then we have a lighter brown and then a darker brown. And if you want to use the same exact hex values that I'm using for the tan color, it's going to be a hex value of FFB97E. And then here for the light brown, this is going to be a hex value of 9E6A42. And then here for the dark brown, this one is going to be a hex value of 66340D. And then I also want to bring this over a bit, and actually I can control shift and select the color ramp to preview it. And I can kind of drag these around. So I don't want to drag them too close to each other because then it's too contrasty. So I'm just going to kind of play around with the placement. I think I'll bring this over a little bit and then maybe bring this back a little bit because I don't want it to be too contrasty. I do want to see a bit of a texture there. So that is pretty good. So I'll just control shift and select the principled shader. Now I also want to give this material a little bit of subsurface scattering just to allow a little bit of light through and make it look a bit more natural and organic and make it look a bit more like food. So right here on the subsurface, this is the subsurface scattering. I'm going to turn this value to a 0.007. So just a tiny little bit of subsurface scattering. And then right here on the subsurface color, I don't want this to be white. So I'm going to click on this color here and I'm going to make this kind of a orange color. And that'll make it look more like bread. And if you want to use the same subsurface color that I'm using, if you go to the hex value, you can punch in E76927. That's the exact subsurface color that I'll be using. And this is definitely going to make it look more natural and organic and more like food. Now I also want to put the mix node into the roughness so that some parts are more rough and other parts are more shiny. So let's take the result here from the mix, the linear light, and I'm going to put that into the roughness. Now this is way too shiny, so I want to make it more rough because this is a biscuit material, so it should be kind of dry and so it should be more rough. So what I'm going to do to control the colors is press Shift-A, go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's stick the color ramp in between the linear light and the roughness. So now we can change the color ramp colors and that'll change how rough and shiny the material is. So if the colors are lighter, then it's going to be more rough. So I'm going to click on this black tab here and I'm going to turn this up and so when I turn it up, you can see now it is much more rough. And that makes it look more dry, kind of like a biscuit. And also this light tab right here, I think I will click on the color and make this just a little bit darker. And if you want to use the same exact hex values that I'm using, over here, this slightly darker gray color, this is going to be a hex value of B4, B4, B4. And then here on the slightly lighter color, this is going to be a hex value of E5, E5, E5. So this is starting to look like a biscuit, but it is very smooth. And so I want to make it bumpy and make it look kind of crumbly. So to do that, I'm going to take this linear light here and I'm going to put it into the normal to give it some bump. Now we need to convert this color data into normal data. So to do that, I can press Shift-A. Let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the bump node. And let's put the bump node in between the linear light and the normal. And then to actually convert it to normal data, we want to put the result here from the linear light into the height value of the bump. And that way it's going to convert to normal data. So now you can see the biscuit looks bumpy. Now it is a bit too strong, so I'm going to take the strength and I'm just going to turn that down to like a 0.3 so it is more subtle. And also, I think it looks better if we invert it. So I'm going to hit the invert button just to invert the bump. Now I also want to add a bit more bump all over. So I want to take this noise texture and I also want to put that into the bump. So I'm going to click on this bump node right here and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it and let's stick it down here. Now the normal can go into the normal and so this way we can mix two bump maps together. And I'm also going to uncheck the invert. So now that we have this other bump node, I can take the noise texture factor and let's put that into the height value of the bump. And then right here on the strength, I do want this to be more subtle. So I'm just going to turn this to like a 0.15. Just a 0.15, I think that looks better. Alright, so that is definitely looking more like a biscuit but you can see the edges are still pretty smooth. And so I'm going to be adding this noise texture into the displacement to actually displace the mesh and make it look kind of bumpy and chunky. So let's take the noise texture factor and I'm going to put that into the displacement of the material output. And then just like these bump nodes, we need to convert this black and white data into displacement data. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the displacement node and I want to put the displacement node here in the wire between the noise texture and the displacement. So you can just stick it right there and it's going to connect it up. And let's bring the displacement down so it isn't overlapping. And then to actually convert it to displacement data, I want the noise texture factor to actually be going into the height value of the displacement. Now you can see it's still not actually displacing the mesh and that's because we need to tell the material that it can use the displacement. So if you go right over here to the side panel and go to the material properties, I'm going to minimize these tabs and I want to open up the settings tab right here. And then right here on the surface displacement, you can see it's set to bump only right now. I want to change this to displacement only. And this is going to tell the material that it can use the displacements. And then it is way too strong, so let's just turn the strength way down on the displacement. So to turn it down, I can turn the scale value to just like a 0.1 for now. Now right here on the displacement, you could change this to displacement and bump and that way it would be more detailed, but I actually prefer the displacement here just to be set to displacement only because we are using these bump nodes here to give the surface some bump. And so I think changing it to displacement and bump actually gives it a bit too much detail because I do want some parts of the biscuit to be a little bit smooth. So you could use displacement and bump if you want to, but I'm going to use displacement only. And this is still too strong, so let's turn the scale down to make it even more subtle. And I'm going to turn the displacement scale to a 0.025. I think that looks pretty good. So now if you look on the edges, you can see it looks bumpy. And that looks much more like a biscuit. And there we have it. So there is the procedural biscuit material. So I'll just give this a final render. So thank you so much for watching this tutorial and I hope you enjoyed it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jN6-7PwH7k,Procedural Abstract Sci-Fi Alien Material (Blender Tutorial),"In the tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design an abstract sci-fi alien material in Blender using procedural nodes, specifically focusing on displacements in the node editor with the Cycles rendering engine. They guide viewers through setting up a 3D scene with an Icosphere, adjusting lighting with HDRI and area lights, and modifying camera settings for a more zoomed-in appearance. The tutorial also covers using various nodes, like magic texture, noise texture, and wave texture, and employing the Node Wrangler add-on for previewing nodes. Additionally, viewers are shown how to control material properties, such as roughness, metallic appearance, and color using color ramps and bump nodes. The creator offers project files for purchase and provides links to their other materials and tutorials, while also mentioning Blender Grid, a render firm, as the video sponsor.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this abstract sci-fi alien material in Blender. So a few days ago, I was playing around with the procedural nodes and trying to create something cool, and I came up with this cool material, and I thought it was pretty interesting, so I thought I'd make a video on it. And if you'd like to purchase the project files, you can get that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. Links in the description. You can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my materials, and that's a great way to help support this channel. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist to watch all of my procedural tutorials. And then also before we start, I wanted to thank this video's sponsor, Blender Grid. Blender Grid is an easy-to-use render firm specifically designed for Blender. I've used the service, and I highly recommend it. Upload your Blender file or a zip file with the Blend file and textures. You can change the render settings on the website before rendering. Blender Grid will let you know the cost before you start the render. You can even choose when you want the render to finish if you're on a tight deadline. While it renders, you can check the rendered frames to make sure everything is rendering properly. Once it finishes, just download the files and compile the frames in a video editor. Use the link in the description to get $20 of render credit on your first render. Now, I will be using the displacements in the node editor to kind of give that wavy effect on the material, so if you want to use the node editor displacements, you will need to use the Cycles rendering engine because the displacements is not supported in Eevee. So let me show you what I have set up in the 3D scene if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I press Shift-A, I went here to Mesh, and I added an Icosphere. And then right after you add the Icosphere, right behind me, there's going to be a little Add Icosphere setting. You can just click on the arrow to open that up, and I'm going to set the subdivisions to 6, and that way it is a nice, smooth, round sphere, and it's pretty detailed. And I want a pretty detailed mesh so that the displacements have more geometry to work with. And then using the Object Context menu, you can shade the object smooth. Now, I want to scale this object to about the real-life size in Blender, and the default cube and the other default objects are roughly the size of an average human. So I'm going to press the Tab key to go into Edit Mode, press the A key to make sure everything is selected, and I'm going to scale this in Edit Mode, and then I can type in 0.3 and Enter. So this way, the object is much smaller, so maybe now it's roughly the size of a beach ball. I'm not trying to get the size perfectly accurate, but just closer to the real-life scale in Blender. And I can Tab to go back to Object Mode. And then I also added a camera, and I pointed the camera at the Icosphere. And then also, right over here on the Camera Settings, I turned the Focal Length up to 110, just so that everything looks a bit more flat and zoomed in. Now, for the lighting, if you go over here to the World Properties, I added in this Skylit Garage 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Links in the description if you'd like to download it. So if I hold down the Z button and move my mouse up into the rendered view, this is just going to give us some nice lighting to light up the sphere. And then I did also add three Area Lights. So if you press Shift-A, you can go to Light and add an Area Light. And so the first Area Light is just kind of pointed down at the sphere. And I set this to kind of like a bluish color and the power to 70. And then the second Area Light I have coming from this side. And for this one, I turned the shape to Rectangle and made it kind of a rectangular shape. I also turned the power up to 150 and made it a slight blue color. And then right over here, I have another one and this is a much longer one. And this one, I set the power to 350 and I made the color kind of a reddish-pinkish color. And then if you want to make the background transparent like I have, then you can go right here to the Render Properties. And if you open up the Film tab, you can checkmark the Transparent button. And this way, you won't be able to see the HDR in the background. So it won't be quite as distracting. And then also right down here on the Color Management, I use the View Transform of Filmic. And I set the look here to Very High Contrast. And this will pop out the colors and make everything more saturated. So now let's click right over here on the Shading tab to go to the Shading workspace. I'm going to hold down the Z button and move my mouse up into the rendered view so I can preview that. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit and you can open up the Preferences. And then over there in the Add-ons tab, you can just search for Node Wrangler and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So you can just select the object and then you can click on New to add a new material. So to start off, I'll press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a magic texture. Let's stick the magic texture right here. And then I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and select different nodes. And that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler. So when you Ctrl-Shift and select different nodes, it'll preview the node on the object. So I'll just Ctrl-Shift and select the magic texture. Now you can change the depth and that's going to change the magic texture. I am going to use a depth of 3. I think that looks pretty cool, but you can change this to your liking. And also on the scale here, I'm just going to turn that up to like an 8. And then also with the magic texture selected, I'm going to press Ctrl-T. And that is going to use the texture coordinate and mapping. But I don't need the mapping, so I can select the mapping and press X to delete it. And then let's put the object into the vector. And the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the object more evenly. So now what I want to do is I want to add a little bit of distortion to the magic texture to make it a bit more noisy. So I can press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a noise texture. And let's actually stick the noise texture in between the texture coordinate and the magic texture. And so this way the noise texture is going to distort the placement of the magic texture because it's going through the vector. And then also let's change some of the settings on the noise texture. So I want to turn the scale to 15. And also I want to turn the detail all the way to the max of 15 as well. And then I do want a bit more roughness, so I will turn the roughness to a 0.55. And then I do think it would be cool to add some distortion. So I'm just going to turn the distortion to 1. Now it's distorting the magic texture way too much, and so I want the noise texture effect to be less strong. So to do that, I can press Shift-A. And let's go to the search. And I can search for the MixRGB. And let's drop the MixRGB in between the two textures. And then I want to drag the noise texture down. And so I want to mix the original object coordinates with the noise texture. So I can take the object here, and I'm going to put that into color 1. And then this noise texture can be going into color 2. So now if I drag the factor, if the factor is all the way to 0, it's just using the object coordinates. But then as I turn the factor up, it's going to use more and more of the noise texture. And so it's going to distort the magic texture more and more. Now you can see that the texture is being moved around a lot. So to make it so it's not being moved around so much, I'm going to click on the mix here. And I'm going to change this to the linear light. And now we can just see the effect of the distortion much better. Now I do want this effect to be very subtle. So I'm going to turn the factor to just a 0.01, so it is much more subtle. But if you zoom in there, you can see there's lots of noise on the edges. So now right back over here on the magic texture, I can put the color into the base color of the principled shader. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now I want this material to be metallic. So let's turn the metallic value all the way to 1. And now it looks more like metal. And then also to make it a bit more shiny for now, we can just turn the roughness down a bit. Now I also want to change the colors. You could leave the colors how they are if you like. But I want to change the colors a bit. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for the color ramp. And let's put the color ramp between the magic texture and the principled shader. So I can now add colors here in the color ramp, and that'll change the magic texture colors. So I'm first going to drag the black tab out a bit so it's a bit more contrasty. And then for this color, I'm going to make it very bright. And I'm going to make it like a red color. And the hex value that I'll be using for this color is FF4B35. So you can punch that into the hex value if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using. Let's also drag this out to make the white a bit more contrasty. And then for this color, I think that a nice light blue looks pretty good. And this color will be a hex value of 529EFF. And then I do also want to add a little bit of pink or purple. So I'm going to hold down the Ctrl key and then click here in the center, and that'll add another tab. And then this one, I'm going to make a little bit more pink. And this color will be a hex value of C17AFF. So now we have some pretty cool colors. Now I also want to put this into the normal to give it some bump because right now the object is very smooth. So let's take the color and I'm going to put that into the normal. Now we need to convert this to normal data because this is a yellow dot here. This is color data. But then this purple dot here, this is normal data. So we need to convert the color data to normal data. So let's press Shift-A. I can go to the search. And I'm going to search for the bump node. And we just want to put the bump node in between the color ramp and the normal. And then to properly convert it to normal data, we want the color to be going into the height value. And now it actually looks like it is bumping out. And then also where those little circles are, they look like they're pushing back in. And then that is a bit too strong, so I'm just going to turn the strength down to like a 0.5. I think that will look much better. Now the next texture that I want to add is a texture that we're going to put into the roughness so that some parts are more rough and other parts are more shiny. So I'm actually going to select this noise texture here. And then I'm going to press Ctrl-Shift-D. So Ctrl-Shift-D will duplicate the node, but it'll keep the wire plugged up so that we're still using the object from the texture coordinate. And then I can also Ctrl-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Now I want to change some of the settings. So let's turn the scale up to like a 20. And then I want to turn the roughness back to the default of 0.5. And the detail I will leave at 15. And also I want even more distortion, so I'm going to turn the distortion up to a value of 2. So I now want these lighter and darker values to control how rough and shiny the material is. So I can take the noise texture factor and let's put that into the roughness. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. So now some parts are more rough and other parts are more shiny. But I want everything to be a bit more shiny, so I want to control these values better. So I can click on this color ramp and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate this color ramp. And then let's stick it in between the noise texture and the roughness. And then I can hit the backspace with the color ramp selected. And that's just going to reset the color ramp. So if you make the colors darker, it's going to make everything more reflective. So if I click on this white tab here, I can click on the color. And I can turn this down and you can see it'll be much more shiny. So I'm going to use a hex value of D4, D4, D4. So it's basically just a very light gray. And so now you can see that the material looks pretty shiny. So now I want to create the texture which is going to be used for the displacement. So to do that, I can press Shift-A and let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for the wave texture. And let's put the wave texture right here underneath the noise. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the wave texture to preview it. And also let's take the object here and I can put the object into the vector so it's placed more evenly. And then I'm going to click on the X right here and I'm going to change this to diagonal. And that way the wave texture lines will be rotated differently. And then what you can do if you want to change where the lines are is you can double tap the R key. And that will activate the trackball rotation. And I can just kind of rotate this around and kind of get it to wherever I want. So I want to bring this down and place it about there. I kind of like that the lines are going up, but then you can kind of see that top part right there. So I think that is pretty cool. Now I want to turn the scale down to make there be less of those lines. So I'm going to turn the scale to a 2.7. I think 2.7 is pretty good. And then also I want to turn the distortion up and that's going to make the lines kind of wobbly. So I will turn the distortion to a 4.3. And also let's turn the detail all the way to the max of 15 so it is very noisy along the edges. So I now want to put this wave texture into the normal to give it some bump. And I also want to put it into the displacement to actually make it popping out. So what I'm going to do is click on this bump node right here. And I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it and let's stick it down here. And then the normal from this bump can go into the normal of the next bump. So now that the normal is going through the normal, we now have this height value that we can add more data into. So let's take the color of the wave texture and I'm going to put that into the height. And then I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader. Now it's a bit too strong right now. So if I go to the bump, I just want to turn this bump strength to a 0.1. And then I also want to put this wave texture into the displacement so that it actually displaces the mesh. So let's take the wave texture color. I can bring out a wire here and I want to put this into the displacement of the material output. And then just like we did here for the normal, we need to convert this color data into displacement data that the material output can use. So I can press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search and I can search for the displacement node. And let's put the displacement node here in the wire before it goes into the displacement. And I can drag the displacement down here underneath the principled shader. And then to actually convert it to displacement data, we want the wave texture color to actually be going into the height value of the displacement. So now you can see it does kind of look like it's popping out, but it isn't actually displacing the mesh at all. You can see the sides here are actually smooth. And that is because we need to tell the material to use the displacements. So if you open up the side panel, you do need to make sure you're using cycles rendered if you want to use the material displacements. And then if you click right down here on the material properties, I'm going to close these tabs here and I'm going to open up the settings tab. And here under surface, there is a displacement and right now it's set to bump only, but we want to change this to displacement and bump. And so this is telling the material that it can use the displacements. So I can just make this smaller. So now you can see that it's actually displacing the mesh and that actually does look pretty cool. It almost looks like an alien mushroom or something like that, but it is way too strong. So I want to make it less strong. So right here on the scale for now, I'm just going to turn this way down to like a 0.1. And actually, I'm going to turn this to a 0.02 for now. So now if you zoom in here, you can see that it is actually displacing the mesh. Now I want to have more control over the shapes of those waves. So what I'm going to do is press shift A. I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for the RGB curves. And I want to put the RGB curves in between the displacement and the wave texture and I can drag it back. And then I want the RGB curves to also be controlling the bump for the waves. So let's put the RGB curves color into the height value of the bump and just replace it for the wave texture color. So now I can change the RGB curves and that'll actually change the shape of those waves. So I'm first going to click here in the center to add a dot and I'm going to bring it down. And then this dot here, I can drag this way down to the bottom. So you can see now it's actually affecting the shape of that. So I'm going to drag this down, bring it to about there. And then I want to click here to add another dot and I'm going to drag this one down a bit. And then I do also want to bring up these dots here on both sides. And that way the crevices won't be quite as sharp. And then I can also click here to add another tab. And let's drag this down there and maybe bring this up a little bit. And this shape is going to be the same shape as those bumps. So now that we've edited the shape with the RGB curves, it isn't very strong. So I'm going to go back here to the displacement. And I'm going to turn the displacement strength up to just like a 0.04. So you can turn the scale to a 0.04 or change it to whatever scale that you want. So there we go, there's the abstract alien material. Now there is just a few settings that I wanted to go over if you want to change the material and make it look different. So right here on the magic texture you can change the depth. And you can see just by changing the depth you can get a bunch of different variations. So I think a depth value of 8 actually looks pretty cool. But I will leave this at 0.3. You can also change the scale and that's going to change the size of those dots. And then you can also turn this distortion value up if you want to make it much more detailed. And of course you can also change the color ramp colors to change the colors of it. Now also right here on this MixRGB, the linear light, you can turn this factor up. And that's going to distort the magic texture more and more. So if you want it to be very detailed you can turn that up. You can also change the scale of the wave texture if you want there to be much more waves or less waves. And you can also change the distortion. So if you want those waves to be much more random you can turn this distortion way up. And that looks pretty cool as well. So thank you for watching this tutorial and I hope you enjoyed it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7Fxp-GzGLg,Procedural Brick Material 🧱 (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the instructor demonstrates how to create a procedural brick material in Blender. The tutorial covers steps such as setting up the 3D space, adding geometry, and using the node editor to create textures and displacements for a realistic brick appearance. The instructor also discusses how to adjust lighting and rendering settings for optimal results. Additionally, viewers are encouraged to check out related tutorials and support the creator through platforms like Gumroad, Patreon, and YouTube memberships for more content and resources.","In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural brick material in Blender. Now this isn't a brick wall material, this is just a single brick. But if you'd like to learn how to create a procedural brick wall material, then I have another tutorial on how to create a procedural brick wall material, and you can check that out with the link in the description. And if you'd like to help support me and this channel and purchase the procedural material, then you can do that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description. And if you like using procedural materials in your project, then definitely check out my Blender procedural material packs. So they're packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. And if you'd like to learn how to create more procedural materials, then you can also check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist with the link in the description. So before we start, I wanted to show you what I have set up in the 3D space if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I pressed Shift A, I went here to mesh, and I added a cube. And then I've been trying to remember to model things to the real life scale in Blender. So I'm going to do that. So I'll press the Tab key to go into edit mode. And when you add a default cube, the default cube is a bit higher than an average person height. So I'm going to tap into edit mode, I'm going to scale the entire thing down. And I'm going to make this much smaller to kind of the size of a brick. And I'm not trying to get the size exact, but just close to the real life scale. So I'm going to scale this down a bit smaller. And I could also scale this out on the y axis a bit. And then I'm going to scale it way out on the x axis so that it is a brick shape, just like that. Now I'm going to be using the displacements in the node editor. And so because I'm using the displacements, I want to give this object more geometry. So what I'm going to do is press Ctrl R to add a loop cut, and then I'm going to scroll my mouse wheel so there are two. And then I can just left click and right click so it stays in the center. And what I'm trying to do is get each face here to be about an even square. And that way the detail will be more even around the entire object. So I could scale this on the x axis, make it a bit smaller, I might also scale it down on the z axis a little bit, then I can press Ctrl R to add another loop cut. And I can left click and right click so it stays in the center there. So now each one of those faces are about an even square shape. So now that these are all an even shape, I can press the A key to select everything. And then I'm going to use the object context menu. So you can just right click to bring up the object context menu. I use the right click select mode in Blender. So I hit the W key to bring up the object context menu. And then I can just click on subdivide. And I'm just going to continue to do that. So I'll just subdivide this a few more times so that it's about that detail. And this way the displacements in the node editor will have more geometry to work with. So I can press the Tab key to go back to object mode. And then using the object context menu in object mode, I will shade the object smooth. So I now want to give this brick even more geometry. So to do that, I'm going to go over here to the modifier properties. And I'm going to click on Add modifier. And I'm going to add the subdivision surface. And I will set the levels viewport and render both up to two so that it has more geometry. So then what I did is I just duplicated some of these bricks and I made kind of like a brick pile to preview the material on. And then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera right down here at the bricks so that we can preview that. And also if you go right over here to the object data properties with the camera selected, I set the focal length to 80. I just like that a bit better so the camera looks like it's kind of zoomed in a little bit more. Now for the lighting, if you go right over here to the world properties, I added in this photo studio broadway hall. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Link will be in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1k HDR version. So on the world settings here, if you click on color and click on that yellow dot, you can choose environment texture and then you can click on open and open up the HDRI. And then I also turned the strength of the HDRI down to just 0.8 so it's a little bit darker than the default. And then I also added these two lights here. So these are just two area lights and I kind of pointed them at the bricks. And right over here on the object data properties, both of these lights I set to a strength of 200. And then I set the color of both of these lights to a very slight yellow color. Now, if you click right here on the render properties, if you want to use the displacements in the node editor, then you will need to be using the cycles rendering engine because the displacements will not work in Eevee. So I'm going to be using cycles. Now, if you also click right down here on the very bottom tab on the color management, I am using the view transform of filmic. And also on the look here, I set this to very high contrast and this will kind of pop out the colors and make things more contrasty and saturated. And then also if you want to make the background transparent, if you open up the film tab, you can click on the transparent button and that way you won't be able to see the HDRI in the background. All right, so I am in the shader editor. So I have the 3D viewport right here and I'm in the rendered mode. And then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'm just going to click on the brick here and I can click on new and I can just rename the material. And then I can click and drag and I can drop this material on to the other two bricks. And there is one more really important thing we need to do to make sure that the displacement works. We need to click right here on the material properties. And if you scroll all the way down or actually close this tab, we want to open up the settings tab and we want to go to the surface. And right here it says displacement. We want to set this to displacement and bump. And this is telling the material that it can use the displacement. So I'll just make this tab smaller. And then one more thing, I will also be using the node wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the node wrangler enabled, you can click on edit and you can go to the preferences. And then over there on the add-ons tab, you can search for node wrangler and just check mark the node wrangler add-on and it's built into blender. So I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, I want to add a little bit of noise on the bricks. So I'm going to press shift day. Let's go to the search and I'm going to add the noise texture and let's stick the noise texture right here. And then with the noise texture selected, I can press control T and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And that is using a feature of the node wrangler. And then also let's hold down the control and shift key and select the noise texture. And that is going to preview the texture on the object. And you can see the texture looks a little bit stretched. So I want to use the object coordinates. So let's put the object into the vector of the mapping. And so now you can see that the noise texture is placed more evenly. And I'm going to leave the mapping node because we can plug the mapping node into each of the textures. And then we can use the scale value here to actually scale the entire material. So now let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale up to like a 20, I think 20 is pretty good. And then I do want it to be very detailed. So let's turn the detail all the way to the max of 15. And then if you kind of zoom in here, if I turn up the roughness a little bit, you can see it looks a bit more rough and kind of has even more detail. So I'm going to turn the detail to like a point seven. And then also just to give it a little bit more randomness, I will turn the distortion to like a point one. So I now want to take the factor of the noise texture, and I'm going to put that into the base color of the principled shader, and I can Ctrl Shift and select the principled shader to preview that. Now that doesn't really look like brick because it's not like a reddish or brownish color. So to change the colors, I can press Shift A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the color ramp node. And let's stick the color ramp in the wire between the noise texture and the principled shader. And then I can kind of drag these two tabs together if I want to make them a bit more contrasty. And then I want to make this kind of like a red brick. So on the white tab here, I can click on the color. And I'm going to make this kind of a red color and then also a little bit darker. And if you want to use the same exact hex value that I'm using right here on this color, if you go to the hex, you can punch in 8E3020. That's the exact color that I'll be using. And then for this black tab here, I'm going to drag it out a little bit. And then instead of it being fully black, I'm going to click on the color. And I'm going to make this a bit brighter. And I'm going to make this a pretty strong kind of like orangey reddish color. And then I'll make it very dark. So it's basically going to be a very dark brown. And the hex value that I'll be using for this color will be 190E05. Now, these bricks are a little bit shiny, and I do want to make them a bit more rough. So let's take the factor here. And I want to put that into the roughness. And that way, the roughness value won't just be a single value, but some parts will be a little bit more rough, and other parts will be a bit more reflective. Now, I want to control this, because if you look here on the side, you can see it still is pretty shiny, and bricks are very rough. So I'm going to click on this color ramp, and I can press Shift D to duplicate it. And let's stick it in between the noise texture and the roughness. And then I can hit the backspace, and that is going to reset the color ramp. So make sure the color ramp is selected, and then you can hit the backspace. So now I can change the colors of the color ramp, and that's going to change how rough and shiny the material is. So if the values are darker, they're going to be more shiny. But if they are lighter, they're going to be more rough. So I can click on the black tab and click on the color here, and I can turn this up. And you can see as I turn it up, it's going to be much more rough. And the hex value that I'll be using is going to be D1, D1, D1. So now you can see the bricks look very rough. Now, I also want to put this noise texture into the normal to give it some bump. So let's take the factor here, and I can put that into the normal. Now, we have some weird shading issues here, and that's because this is black and white data, but then this is normal data. So we need to convert the black and white data into normal data that the principled shader can use. So let's press Shift-A. I can go here to the search, and I can search for the bump node. And let's put the bump node in between the noise texture and the principled. And then I can take the factor, and let's actually put that into the height value, and that way it'll convert it to normal data. So now you can see the bricks look very bumpy. And then the strength value is a bit high at one, so I'm going to turn it way down to just like a 0.2, so it is less strong. Now, I also want to add a texture for some cracks along the bricks. So to do that, I can press Shift-A. Let's go to the search, and I can search for the Voronoi texture. And let's put the Voronoi underneath the noise texture. And I can click and drag to drag a box around these nodes and bring them back a bit. And I want to take the vector and put that into the vector of the Voronoi so that it's using the object coordinates. And then I can Control-Shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. Now, if I click on the F1 here, I want to change this to distance to edge. And this texture here is what we're going to use for the cracks. Now, the cracks are a little bit big, but we actually want to distort the cracks to make them look a bit more noisy and natural. And so I'm going to leave the scale at 5, because when we distort them, they'll be a bit smaller. So you can see these cracks are very smooth and straight, but I want to make them more random. So we're going to distort the placement of the Voronoi. So let's press Shift-A. I can go to the search, and I'm going to search for another noise texture. And let's just stick the noise texture down here. And then I want to take the vector of the mapping here, and I want to put that into this noise texture as well so that they're all using the object coordinates. And then I can Control-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Now, I'm going to leave the scale at 5, but I am going to turn the detail all the way to the max of 15 so it's very detailed. And then I want to take the factor, and I actually want to put that into the Voronoi. And then I can Control-Shift and select the Voronoi texture. So now the noise texture is distorting the placement of the Voronoi. But you can see it's distorted way too much, so I want it to have less of an effect or be less strong. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the MixRGB. And let's stick the MixRGB in between the noise texture and the Voronoi. And then I want to take the original object coordinates from the mapping, and I'm going to stick that into color 1 of the mix. And then I actually don't want to use the factor, I want to use the color of the noise texture. So let's put the color into color 2. So basically what we're doing is we are using this mix to mix between the noise and the original object coordinates, which aren't distorted. And then once that is mixed together, the mix is going into the Voronoi. So if I drag the factor, if I turn the factor all the way to 0, it's just using color 1, which is the original object coordinates. But if I turn the factor up, it's going to use more and more of the noise. So if I turn the factor all the way up to 1, now it's very distorted. And I actually want to click on the mix here, and I want to change this to the linear light, and that way it's going to work a bit better. So if I turn the factor down now, you can see that the texture is being distorted, but it's not moving around quite as much. And then also, let's turn the factor all the way up to 1, because I do want the cracks to be very distorted and noisy. So now they look a bit more random and a bit more natural. I don't want there to be cracks all over the place, I just want a few little spots here and there where there's some small cracks. So what I'm going to do is click and drag, just to box select all these nodes, and I'm going to bring them back so we have a bit more space. And so I'm going to mix this noise texture with the Voronoi, and we're going to make it so that the Voronoi cracks are just in some places here and there. So I'm going to click on this linear light here, and I can press Shift-D to duplicate it. Let's drop it down here. And then I just want to change it back to mix. So if we click on the type here, I can just click back to mix, which is the default. And so I'm going to drop the mix after the Voronoi distance. And then I want to mix it with the noise texture. So I'm going to take the factor here, and let's put that into the factor of the mix. And then we're going to take the Voronoi distance, and we're going to put that into color 2. Then color 1 right here, I just want to make fully white. So the factor is going to control where it's going to be color 1 and where it's going to be color 2. And so the noise texture is controlling where that is. Now you can't really see the effect that it's doing because the noise texture isn't very contrasty. So I want to make the noise texture more contrast before it goes into the mix. So to do that, I can just take any of these color ramps. I'll just click on the color ramp, and I can press Shift-D to duplicate it. And let's stick it right here in between this noise texture and the mix going into the factor. So just stick it right there. And I think I'm going to box select some of these nodes and bring them down a bit so there's a bit more space. So I'll bring that down as well. And then if you click on the color ramp, you can hit the backspace, and that will reset the color. So I can now start to drag these values together, and that is going to make it more contrasty. And I can actually Control-Shift and select the color ramp to preview it. So I'm going to bring these very close together, kind of in the center, so it's very contrasty. So then the white and black values are going to tell it where the cracks are and where the cracks are going to be disappeared. So I can now Control-Shift and select the mix. So now you can see that wherever the white values are on this color ramp, you can see there's like a white patch right there. That is where the cracks are going to show up. Now the cracks aren't very contrasty as well. You can see the cracks are just kind of gray. And I want the places where there aren't cracks to be joined together with this white area, so it just looks like there are cracks here and there. And also the cracks are a little bit thick, so I want to make them smaller. So again, I'm going to just kind of box select these nodes and bring them back so I have a bit more space. And then I can click on this color ramp here and I can press Shift-D to duplicate it. And let's stick it here after the Voronoi. So this is also going to make the Voronoi texture more contrasty. And I can Control-Shift and select it to preview it and see what we're doing. So I'm going to drag this black tab way back, and then I'm going to drag the white tab way over. And I can also bring the black tab out just a little bit. So you can see that because we've dragged these over here, the cracks are now very thin and they're much more contrasty. So I just want to do something like that. So I can Control-Shift and select the mix to preview it. And there we go. So we now just have a few little cracks here and there. So I now want to put the cracks into the bump to make it look like the cracks are going in. So I can click on this bump node here, and I'm going to bring it back so there's a bit more space. And I can press Shift-D to duplicate it, and we can drop it here after the first bump. So the normal can go through the normal, but we now have another height value that we can add data into and mix multiple bumps together. So let's take the mix here, let's take the color, and I'm going to put that into the height of the bump. And then I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now the cracks aren't very strong right now, so to see them better, I'm going to turn the strength all the way up to 1 so that it is much more strong. And also if you wanted to, you could rename the bumps. So with the bump selected, you could press F2 to add a label, and then I could just call this like CracksBump, like that. I could also click on this bump node here, and then press F2 to give it a label, and I could just call this like NoiseBump, just to organize the nodes better. Now I want to have some areas where the bricks kind of have a dented area or kind of chunks taken out of them. So what I'm going to do is click on one of these bumps, and I can press Shift-D to duplicate, I can drop it down here, and the normal can go into the normal. And then if I click on this bump node here, I can press F2 to change the label. And I'm just going to rename this to DamageBump, because I want to make the bricks look like they're a little bit damaged, and maybe there's some chunks out of them. So I can now take the factor, and I want to put that into the height value of the DamageBump. Now this is the same noise texture which is going into the NoiseBump, and so I want to make this DamageBump a little bit more contrasty, so it's a bit stronger and just in some areas. So I can click on any of these color ramps, and I can press Shift-D to duplicate it, and I'm going to drop it here before the DamageBump, so just drop it down there. And then with the color ramp selected, I can hit the backspace to reset it. So I now want to click on the white tab, and I want to drag it over, and that's going to make it more contrasty. And if I Ctrl-Shift and select the DamageBump, you can see what it's doing. So now there's just a few areas here and there where there's some little damage. And I want to make it a bit stronger, so I want to take the strength, and I'm going to turn that up to like a 0.5, so it's a bit stronger. But then I'm also going to want to put this texture into the displacement later. So if I click on this black tab here, I want to turn this up and make it kind of like a light color, so that it is more subtle. And this will be better for when we're putting this in the displacement. And the light gray color that I'm going to be using is a hex value of DADADA. So now you can see there's some little damage here and there, so I'll just Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader. But you can see that the damage isn't actually going in that much, so I want to take this color ramp, and I want to put that into the displacement to actually make it pushing in. So I'm going to take the color here, and I'm going to put that into the displacement of the material output. But when I do that, you can see that the material is having some weird issues. It's kind of jetting off to the side, and that is because I need to actually convert the color data into displacement data that the material output can use. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the displacement. And let's stick the displacement node here in the wire between the color ramp and the material output here. So just stick it right there. And then just so that it's not overlapping, I'm going to drag it right down here. Now we actually want the color ramp to be going into the height value of the displacement, and that way it's going to convert it to proper displacement data. Now you can see that it's way too strong, so let's turn the scale way down here in the displacement. And if we turn the scale down, it's going to be much more subtle. And I want to turn the displacement down to like a 0.01. So just a 0.01, so it's much more subtle. But now if I zoom in there, you can see that it is popping in a little bit. Now I also want to make the edges be a bit more bumpy, because if you look here on the edges, you can see it is pretty smooth. The displacement is working a little bit to kind of make those little parts kind of go in a bit, but I want everything to be a little bit more bumpy, so it just looks a bit more natural. So what I want to do is add another noise texture, and then we're going to mix it into the displacement. So I can actually just click on this noise texture right down here, and I'm going to press Ctrl-Shift-D. And Ctrl-Shift-D will duplicate the node, but it'll keep the wire plugged up. And I'm just going to drop it down here. And then I just want to Ctrl-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Now I want to turn the scale up a bit, so let's turn the scale to like a 15. And then I'll leave the detail at 15 and the roughness to 0.5. So I now want to mix this noise texture into the displacement. And so to do that, we can use a MixRGB. So I can click on any of these MixRGB nodes, and I can press Shift-D to duplicate it. And we're going to stick it right down here before the displacement. So now what I can do is I can take this noise texture, and I can take the factor, and I'm going to put that into the factor of this MixRGB. And then I want this color ramp right here to be going into color 1 of the mix. And then I just want to add the dark values. So let's click on the mix here, and I can change this to darken. So I'm now going to take color 2, and I'm going to make it fully dark. So because this noise texture right over here is going into the factor, the factor is telling it where it's going to be color 1 and where it's going to be color 2. So we can make color 2 fully black. And now on the edges there, it is kind of bumpy and lumpy. But I still want the strength to be turned down. I don't want the strength to be turned up too high, or it just won't look like brick. So I'm going to leave the scale at 0.01, so it is pretty subtle. So I can now Ctrl-Shift and select the principal shader. Now there is one more thing I want to show you. I want to show you how you can scale the entire texture. So this mapping node is plugged into all of the textures. And so we can use the scale value, and we can scale it bigger or smaller, and we can adjust it depending on how big or small the object is. Now to change all these values at once, what I can actually do is press Shift-A, go to the search, and I can just search for a value node. Let's put the value node here, and then the value can go into the scale. And then I want the default scale to be set to 1. So I can now just drag the scale, and that's going to change the size of the textures. So if I have a bigger object or a smaller object, I can just drag the value, and I can turn this up, and now it's much more detailed. But I'm going to leave this at the default of 1, because that is good for the size of these bricks. So there we go, there is the procedural brick material. So I'll just give this a final render.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdVOXc7zs24,Procedural Meatball Material 🍝 (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor demonstrates how to create a procedural meatball material and a tomato sauce layer in Blender. The tutorial covers setting up the 3D scene, using different textures, and employing the Node Editor for detailed material creation, including bump mapping and displacement. The instructor also explains how to mix the meatball and sauce materials to achieve a realistic look. Additionally, viewers are informed about purchasing the materials on the instructor's Gumroad and Patreon for support and are introduced to the Physical Starlight and Atmosphere Blender add-on for realistic skylighting.","In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural meatball material in Blender. And on top of the meatball, we're also going to be creating a tomato sauce or a pasta sauce. And I'll show you how you can control how much of the sauce you want on the meatball. If you'd like to purchase this procedural material and help support the channel, then you can do that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page with the links in the description. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my materials, and I also have a procedural food pack where you can just purchase my procedural food materials. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, then you can also check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. And then one more thing before we start, I wanted to let you know about the Physical Starlight and Atmosphere Blender add-on. Physical Starlight and Atmosphere is an amazing Blender add-on for creating realistic skies and skylighting. I've used the add-on myself, and I highly recommend it. You can customize the sun, atmosphere, stars, clouds, fog, and more. The add-on also provides some outstanding sky presets, such as Daytime and Sunset, Fog and Haze, Mars, and even Retrowave. You can also change the time of day just by rotating the sunlight. Check out the add-on with the link in the description, and by purchasing the add-on through my link, you'll be helping to support this channel. Alright, so before we start, I wanted to show you what I have set up in the 3D scene if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I pressed Shift-A, I went here to Mesh, and I added an Icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click on the little Add Icosphere arrow right there and open that up, I turned the subdivisions up to 6 so that it was very detailed. And then I just shaded the object smooth. And I want a very high-poly, detailed sphere, because I'm going to be using the displacements in the Node Editor to actually pop out the mesh. And so if we have more geometry, it'll be more detailed. And then I also added a camera here, and I just pointed the camera at the Icosphere. Now for the lighting, I pressed Shift-A, and I added a plane. And then what I did is added the subdivision surface modifier to the plane, and that way it is a circular shape. And then I moved the plane right over here so that it is pointed towards the front of the sphere. And then so that this plane gives off light, I gave it a new material, and I gave it an emission material. And I turned the strength up to 50, and I also gave it a slightly yellow color. But you could also go here to Light, and just add a normal area light if you wanted to. And then also to get some really nice, realistic lighting and reflections, if you go over here to the World Properties, I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, links in the description if you'd like to download it. So if you add a new world, right here next to Color, you can click on the yellow dot there, and you can choose Environment Texture, and then you can click on the Open button and open up the downloaded HDRI. And again, on polyhaven.com, I downloaded the 1K HDRI version. And then I also turned the strength to 0.8 to make it a little bit less strong. And then let's also go right up here to the Render Properties. I'm going to be using the Cycles rendering engine because Cycles is more realistic. And also I'm going to be using the displacements in the Node Editor, so if you want to use the displacements, you will need to be in Cycles. And then also if you open up the Film tab right down here, I set the background here to transparent, so under Film you can checkmark the transparent if you want to make the background transparent so you can't see the background HDRI. And then also to make the colors look a bit nicer and more saturated, if you go right here to the Color Management and open this up, you can set the View Transform to Filmic and the Look here to High Contrast. And this will pop out the colors and make things a bit more saturated and contrasty. And then one other thing I did to the sphere, if you go right over here to the Modifier Properties, I clicked on Add Modifier and I added the Subdivision Surface Modifier and I just set the Viewport and Render Levels both to 1. And this is just going to subdivide the sphere and give it even more detail, and that way when we add the displacements, it'll have more geometry to work with. And then I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on Edit and you can go to the Preferences and then click on the Add-ons tab and you can search for Node Wrangler and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. And the add-on is built in a Blender and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So then I'm in the Shading workspace, so I have the 3D space here and I'm going to hold down the Z button and go up into the Rendered View. And then I also have the Shader Editor right over here. So I'm going to click on the New button to add a new material. And then there is one more really important thing if you want to use the displacements. You need to go right over here to the Material Properties and I'm going to close these tabs and I'm going to open up the Settings tab. So right here on the Displacement, we want to change this to Displacement and Bump. So this is telling this material that it can use the displacements. So I'm just going to make this smaller to get this side panel out of the way and then I'm going to rename this material to Meatball. So we're first going to start by creating the basic Meatball material. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go here to the Search, and I'm going to search for the Noise Texture and let's stick the Noise Texture right here. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the Noise Texture and that is going to use the feature of the Node Wrangler and it will allow us to preview the different nodes on the object by Ctrl-Shift and selecting the different nodes. And then with the Noise Texture selected, I'm also going to press Ctrl-T and that is going to add the Texture Coordinate and Mapping nodes. And I want to use the Object Coordinates because the Object Coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. So let's take the object and I'm going to put that into the vector of the mapping. And I'm actually going to leave the Mapping node because I'm going to use the Mapping node to scale all the textures at once if I want to scale how big the textures are. So let's now change some of the Noise Texture settings. So I'm going to leave the Scale at 5, I think that is pretty good. And I'm also going to turn the Detail up a bit. So I'm going to turn the Detail to 6. I don't want to turn it up too much because I don't want it to be too detailed, but I'll just turn it up to 6. And then also on the Roughness here, I do want to turn the Roughness up a little bit. So I'm going to turn the Roughness to just a 0.7. So I'm now going to put the Factor here from the Noise Texture into the Principled Shader Base Color so that we can actually use that as the color of the material. So let's take the Factor and I can put that into the Base Color. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the Principled Shader to preview it. Now that isn't looking like a meatball and we need to change the colors because right now the colors are just black and white. So I can press Shift-A. Let's go here to the Search. And I'm going to search for the Color Ramp. And let's stick the Color Ramp in between the Noise Texture and the Principled. So I can now change the colors of the Color Ramp to change the actual base color colors. So I'm first going to click on this white tab here and I want to make this a dark brown color for the meatball meat. So I'm going to bring the color down so it's darker and then make it kind of like an orange color and that is going to make it like a dark brown. I do want it to be pretty dark though. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using, you can go over to the Hex value and you can punch in 241305. That is the exact color that I'll be using. And then I'm going to click on this black tab here. And this black tab, I'm actually going to make this like a light brown or a lighter brown. So I'm going to make this a bit brighter and then make it kind of orange so it'll be kind of a brown color. And the Hex value that I'll be using for this lighter brown color is going to be 7E577. So you can go to the Hex and punch in that value if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using. And then I actually want to make these a bit more contrasty. So I can drag these together and you can see if I drag them really close, it's going to be very contrasty. I'm just going to drag this to about there and then also maybe I'll bring this tab back a little bit just like that. So it's a bit more contrasty. Now I also want to play around with this roughness and I want to make it more shiny because I want to make the meat look very wet and oily and look like it was just cooked. But instead of using a single roughness value, I want some parts to be a little bit more rough and other parts to be a little bit less rough. So I'm going to take the noise texture factor and I'm going to stick that into the roughness of the principled shader. And then I want to have more control over this. So let's click on this color ramp here and I can press Shift D to duplicate it and we're going to drop it in between the noise texture and the principled. And then I want to reset this color ramp. So with this color ramp selected, you can hit the backspace and that'll reset the color ramp. So I can now change the colors of the color ramp to actually change how shiny the meatball is. So I'm going to click on the white tab here and click on the color. And if I make this darker, you can see the meatball is going to be much more shiny. Whereas if I make it lighter, it's going to be more rough. So I'm just going to make it kind of like a light gray. And to use the same exact color that I'm using for the light gray over here on the hex value, you can punch in B6, B6, B6. So now the meatball is pretty shiny, but there are some parts along the texture where it's a little bit more rough. So it just makes it look a bit more random and natural. Now the meatball is still very smooth and I want the meatball to be very lumpy. And I also want to add some values into the displacement to make it actually bumping out. So first I'm going to put this noise texture into the normal to give it some bump. So let's take the factor from the noise texture and I'm going to put that into the normal. Now we need to convert this to normal data because you can see there's some weird shading issues. So I can press shift A. Let's go here to the search and I can search for the bump node. And we're going to stick the bump node in between the noise texture and the principle. And then to actually convert the black and white data into normal data, we want to put the noise texture factor into the height value. And now the meatball actually looks bumpy. Now that is very strong. So let's turn the bump strength way down. I'm just going to turn it down to like a 0.2 so that it is not very strong. But if you zoom in there, you can see there is still a lot of bump along the surface of the meatball. Now this still isn't looking quite like a meatball because it is very smooth along the edges. So I want to add another noise texture and we're going to use that noise texture in the displacement. So I'm going to select this noise texture here and I can press control shift D. So control shift D will duplicate the node, but it'll keep the wires plugged up. I'm just going to bring this noise texture down here and then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I want it to be more lumpy. I don't want it to be super detailed. So I'm just going to turn the scale to like a 2.8 and that way it's going to be a bit smaller. And then I do want it to be very detailed. So let's turn the detail all the way up to the max of 15. But then I don't want there to be very much roughness. So let's turn the roughness back to the default, which is 0.5. So now you can see that there are just some big blobs of color. Some parts are lighter and some parts are darker. So I now want to put this into the displacement to actually make it bump. So let's take the factor from this noise texture and I'm going to put this into the displacement of the material output. And then I can control shift and select the principles shader. So you can see it's doing something, but it's really weird. It's like jutting off to the side. And why this is happening is because we need to convert this factor data into displacement data. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go here to the search and I can search for the displacement node. And we want to stick this node in between the noise texture and the displacement. And then I can drag it right here underneath the principled shader. And then to actually convert it to proper displacement data, I want the factor to be going into the height value instead. So now you can see it looks very bumpy. Now that is a bit too strong. So let's make it less strong. So right here on the scale, I can turn this down and you can see it's much less strong now. I'm going to turn the scale to just like a 0.25. I think a 0.25 is pretty good for the meatball. So now this material is really starting to look much more like a meatball. Now there is one more really important thing that I want to do. I want to give it some subsurface scattering to allow a little bit of light through, and that's going to make it look a bit more fleshy and make it look a bit more like food. So right here on the subsurface, I'm just going to turn this up to like a 0.02, just a 0.02. So there is just a tiny little bit of subsurface scattering, but you can see it makes it look much more organic and natural, and it looks much more like food now. And then right here on this subsurface color, I'm going to make this kind of like a orange color and kind of dark so that it is kind of brown. And for the subsurface color, if you want to use the same exact value, you can go to the hex and you can punch in 5B 3D 00. So there we have it. There is the procedural meatball material. So what I'm going to do is click and drag just to box select all these nodes here. So I'm box selecting the principled shader, the two color ramps and the bump, and then also this noise texture. And I'm going to press control J, and that is going to join them together into a frame. And you don't have to do this, but I just want to do this to keep my nodes nicely organized. So then you can click on the frame and you can press F2 to add a label, and I can just call this meatball. So there we go. There is the meatball material. And then these nodes over here that is controlling the mapping. And then this noise texture and the displacement that is controlling the displacement. So if all you wanted to create was the meatball, then you can finish the tutorial here. But now we're going to be creating the tomato sauce. And I think adding the tomato sauce or pasta sauce really makes the meatball look much more interesting. So I'm going to be creating the tomato sauce down here, and then we are going to add it into the material. So let's press shift day. I'm going to go here to the search and I'm going to search for the principled shader. Let's click on the principled shader and drop it here. And then I want to control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now I want to turn the subsurface up a lot because I want a lot of light to go through the pasta sauce. So I'm going to take the subsurface and I'm going to turn that up to like a point three. And then let's click on the base color here. And I'm going to make this kind of like a dark red color for the tomato sauce. And if you want to use the same exact base color that I'm using over here on the hex value, you can punch in seven, eight, one, five, zero, zero. And then I also want to change the subsurface color and actually want to make the subsurface color the same color. So I can just click and drag and I can drop the color from here right down here. So you can just click and drag and drop the material down there. So now that is starting to look like tomato sauce. Now let's actually turn the roughness down because I want it to be very shiny because tomato sauce is very shiny. So let's just turn the roughness to like a 0.25 and now is much more shiny. And then I also want to add just a little bit of data into the normal to give it a little bit of bump. Right now there is some bump, but that is just from the displacement. So I also want to add a little bit of bump to the pasta sauce. So what I'm going to do is select this noise texture right up here and I'm going to press control shift D. So control shift D is going to duplicate the node, but it'll keep the wire plugged up. I'm going to bring it down here and then I want to take the factor and let's put that into the normal of the pasta sauce. And then we need to convert this to normal data. So right up here, you can see we added the bump node to convert it to normal data. So let's do the same thing down here. So I can press shift day, go to the search and I'm going to search for the bump node and let's put the bump node in between the noise texture and the principle shader for the pasta sauce. And then the factor here can go into the height value. So it converts it to proper normal data. And then I want to turn the strength way down. So let's just turn the strength to like a 0.2. So it is very subtle. So it's just going to add a little bit of bump. So what I'm going to do is click and drag to box select these three nodes and I can press control J and that's going to join them together into a frame. And I can drag the nodes together to kind of compress them, make them a bit smaller and more compact. And then if I click on the frame, I can press F2 to add a label and I'm going to rename this to sauce. So now we have the meatball material and the sauce material and I can hold down the control and shift key and click between them to preview them. So I now want to join them together. So I'm going to bring the material output down here, kind of in between the two materials and I'm going to press shift day. Let's go here to the search and I'm going to search for the mix shader. Let's click on the mix shader and I can drop it right here before the surface of the material output. And then I want to take the principled shader here from the sauce. And let's put that into the bottom shader. And then the meatball here can be going into the top one. So the mix shader is going to mix these two materials together. And if I drag the factor, that's going to tell it to only use the sauce. Or if I turn the factor down to zero, it's only going to use the meatball. But instead of dragging around this value, I want the top part to be the sauce and the bottom part to be the meatball. So to do this, we need to create a mask and we need to put the mask into the factor. So I'm going to drag the sauce down so that we have a bit more space and I can drag the displacement over. I'm actually going to put the displacement node right here underneath the mix shader. And then just to kind of get this out of the way, I'm going to click and drag to box, select these nodes. I can bring them back a bit and then I'm going to bring this noise texture up here. So I want some space right in here in between the meatball and the sauce that I can create the gradient. So I'm going to press shift day, let's go here to the search and I'm going to search for the gradient texture and let's put the gradient texture right here. And then I can control shift and select the gradient texture to preview it. Now we're going to use the gradient texture to tell it where it's going to be the meatball and where it's going to be the sauce. And then I actually want to use the generated coordinates of the texture coordinate. So on the generated here from the texture coordinate, let's take the generated and I can put that into the vector of the gradient texture. Now I want to rotate the gradient texture because I don't want it the gradient to be right here. I want the gradient to instead be going up and down. So I'm going to click on this mapping node and I can press shift D to duplicate it and I can put the mapping node right here before the gradient texture. And then I'm going to drag it over and kind of stick it underneath this mapping. And we could also bring the texture coordinate down kind of in the center of the two mapping nodes. So now on this mapping node, which is going into the gradient, I can rotate the rotation Y and that's going to rotate the gradient around. So I'm going to change the rotation Y to 90 degrees. And that way now the gradient is going to start down here as black. And then as it goes up, it'll get lighter and lighter. Now I don't want the gradient texture to be super smooth. I want the gradient texture to be much more sharp. And I also want it to be lumpy to kind of make the pasta sauce look like it's dribbling down the meatball. So to do this, I'm going to take this noise texture here. I'm going to bring it up and then I can press control shift D. So control shift D will duplicate the node, but keep the wires plugged up. And I could also box select these nodes, maybe bring them down a little bit. And then I can control shift and select this noise texture that we duplicated. So I'm going to put this noise texture into the gradient. I'm going to mix it with the vector. And that way the noise texture will distort how the gradient shape is. So to do this, I can press shift A. Let's go to the search and I can search for the mix RGB. Let's put the mix RGB right here before the gradient. And then right here over here on the mapping, I want the mapping vector to actually be going into color two of the mix RGB. And then I want this noise texture here, the one that we duplicated. I want the factor to be going into color one. And then I can control shift and select the gradient texture to preview it. So now if I drag the factor here on the mix, if I turn it all the way up to one, it's just going to use the mapping. But then if I turn the factor all the way to zero, it's just going to use the noise texture. Now, instead of setting it to mix here, I want to click on this and I instead want to change it to the linear light. And this way I could drag the factor and you can see if I turn the factor up, it's going to now use this noise texture to make the gradient all lumpy. So the gradient still is there because the gradient is darker down here and then lighter up here. But now this noise texture is making the edge of that gradient very bumpy and noisy. So I will turn the factor all the way up to one. So it's completely using the noise texture to distort the gradient. Now I do want to change some of the noise texture settings because I actually don't want it to be this detailed because this is going to be the gradient for the pasta sauce. I want it to be a little bit more lumpy and blobby. So I'm going to take the scale here of this noise texture and I'm going to turn it to like a 4.8 so that is a bit bigger. But then I don't want it to be very detailed because right now it is very detailed. So let's turn the detail to just like a 2 and this way it'll be more lumpy. And then I actually don't want this much roughness. So let's turn the roughness down to like a 0.3. So if we turn it down to 0.3, now you can see we just have these little blobs which are kind of coming down and this is going to make it look like the pasta sauce is kind of dribbling down the meatball. Now I want to control where the gradient is because right now the gradient is actually covering most of the meatball. But I actually want the gradient to be kind of up here so it's just kind of covering the top of the meatball. So to do this, I can press Shift-A. Let's go to the search and I can search for the color ramp. And let's put the color ramp here after the gradient texture. And so I can now drag the black tab of the color ramp and that is going to control where the gradient is. So wherever the values are white, that is where the tomato sauce is going to be. And then wherever it's black, that is where the meatball is going to be. So I'm going to drag this kind of to about here so that there's much more meatball. And then I'm also going to click on this white tab and I'm going to drag it over a little bit so it's a bit more contrasty. So we can now take the color of this color ramp and we're going to stick that into the factor of the mix shader to control where it's going to be each shader. And then I can Control-Shift and select the mix shader to preview it. And now you can see that the pasta sauce is just on the top of the meatball. And if for some reason this is the opposite, what you can do is you can just click on this shader here, pull out the wire and stick it into the bottom one. And now it's going to flip it, but I don't want it to be flipped. So I'm going to click and drag and drop it right there. So the sauce is going to go into the bottom one and the meatball is going to go into the top one. So that is looking really cool, but I actually want the sauce on top to be a bit more smooth and it's going to be a bit more lumpy because right now it's just using the displacement of the meatball, but I actually want to be much more smooth on the top. And then also I want the pasta sauce to be a bit more thick. So I actually want to make the pasta sauce be popping out a bit. So we are going to take this color ramp value here and we are going to mix it in with the displacement to actually make the sauce be popping out a little bit more. So to do this, I can press shift A. Let's go to the search and I can search for another mix RGB. And I want to put the mix RGB right here in this wire before the displacement height. So just stick it right there and just put it right next to the displacement. And then I want to take the color ramp color and I want to put that into the factor of the mix RGB. And then I can control shift and select the mix RGB to preview it. And then right up here, we have this noise texture and this noise texture was controlling the bumpy part of the meatball. And I want the factor of that to be going into color one. Now I just want to add the light values because if I control shift and select the color ramp, you can see these top values here are white. And that is where I want the pasta sauce to be popping out more. So I just want to add the light values. So if I click on the mix here, I can change this to lighten. And then let's control shift and select the mix shader to preview it. So I can now take color two and I can turn this up and you can see as I turn it up, it's going to add more and more of the sauce. So now the sauce is actually popping out and there's some really thick sauce now on the meatball. So I'm going to turn color two all the way up to one. Now this is a bit too strong right now. And so I want to make the sauce a little bit less strong. And if the pasta sauce isn't very thick, you would be able to see through it a little bit. So I want to make it a bit less strong and also a bit less visible. So to do that, I can change the color ramp white value because on this color ramp, the white value is controlling how much sauce there is. So if I click on the white tab, I can turn this down and you can see if I turn it down far enough, there isn't going to be any sauce at all. But then as I turn it up, there's going to be more and more of that red color. And the pasta sauce is going to be a bit stronger. So you can just change this to your liking. And if you want to use the same exact value that I'm using, I'm going to be using a hex value of cd cd cd. So that is the gray color that I'll be using for the amount of pasta sauce that I want. So now you can see there is a little bit of pasta sauce and the sauce is popping out more. So it looks like it's on top of the meatball. But then you can kind of see the meatball through the sauce. It is kind of just a thin layer. But then the sauce also looks like it's kind of dribbling down. You can change the amount of sauce just by dragging this value here. So if you want the sauce to be dribbling down farther, you could drag this down. And then also, if you want to change the size of all the textures, you can go over here to this mapping. And I actually want one single value to change all the scale values. So I can actually just press Shift A. Let's go here to the search. And I can search for a value node. And let's put the value node underneath the texture coordinate. And then I want the value to be going into the scale of the mapping. And this way, this single value is going to change all of the scale, the X, Y, Z scale of this mapping. And then I need to turn it back to the default value, which is 1. And so now I can drag this value. And that is going to change the size of all the textures. Because all these textures are going through this mapping. And so this value will change the size of the textures. So if you have a bit larger meatball or a bit smaller meatball, you could change that value. And then, of course, right over here on the displacement, if you want to change how strong the displacement is, you can drag the scale of that displacement. So there we have it. There is the procedural meatball material with the sauce. So I'm now going to give this a final render. So thank you so much for watching this tutorial. I hope you found it helpful.

If you'd like to purchase this procedural material and help support the channel, then you can do that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. Links are in the description. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my materials, and that's also a great way to help support this channel. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. So before we create the procedural material, I did want to show you how I set up the fabric object if you want to create it the same way that I have. Or you can add it to whatever fabric object that you're using. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to Mesh, and I'm going to add a UV sphere. And then I'm going to press Ctrl-2. Ctrl-2 is the shortcut key to add a subdivision surface modifier. And then using the object context menu, I can shade this smooth. So we're going to now create a fabric object, and we're going to drop the fabric object on this sphere using the cloth physics. So I can now press Shift-A. Let's go here to Mesh, and I'm going to add a plane. And I can press the Tab key to go into edit mode, and I can scale this entire thing up. And I'll make it about that big. And then I can press Tab to go back to object mode. Then I can press G to grab, and let's hit Z, bring this up on the Z axis, and just stick it right there. And then I can press the Tab key again to go back into edit mode. And then using the object context menu, you can hit the subdivide button. And then after hitting the subdivide, right behind me, there's that little subdivide and the arrow right there. If you click on that, that'll open up the subdivide settings, and there is a number of cuts here. So I'm going to use 50 cuts, so I'm going to type in 50, and then I can click on this to close that. So this object now has a lot of geometry, and so it'll work well with the cloth physics. Because the cloth physics will look higher quality if there's more geometry that it can actually use to do the simulation. And then I can press the Tab key to go back to object mode. Now it's also very important that your object has a decent UV map. So if you click right over here on the UV editing, you can see this plane already has a UV map, because when you add primitive objects, they automatically have a UV map. And it is very important that your object has a decent UV unwrap, because we are going to use the UV unwrapping to tell the textures how they're going to be placed on the object. And I'll show you why we need this when we create the procedural material. And if you'd like to learn the basics of UV unwrapping in Blender, then definitely check out my UV unwrapping for beginners tutorial with the link in the description. So once you've UV unwrapped the object, you can go back here to the layout. And I'm now going to add the cloth physics. So let's click right over here on the physics properties. And for this object here, we want to add the cloth, so just click on cloth. And I'm going to leave all these settings at the default, except I'm going to scroll way down here, and I'm going to open up this collision tab. And then I'm going to turn on the self collision. And this way, the cloth will collide with itself, and it won't go through itself. And that'll make it look better. And then I'm going to click on this sphere here. And for this one, I need to turn on the collision, so you can give it collision physics. And that way, the cloth will actually collide with the object instead of going through it. And then you can press the space bar, and the space bar is going to play the simulation. And if it's acting really laggy when you hit the space bar to play the animation, instead of just playing it, what you can do is you can bake the simulation. So if I scroll right down here, you can see that there is cache. And I could set a simulation start and a simulation end. So for instance, you could just change this to like 100. And then you could click on the bake button, and it'll bake the simulation. And then when you play the timeline by hitting the space bar, it's going to be much more smooth. And I actually closed my timeline. So I'm going to click right up here when the crosshair appears. And I can click and drag down, and then this will split the window. And then right here on the editor type, I can just change this to the timeline. And you can see this is actually a little bit small, so I want to make the cloth bigger. So I'm going to drag this back to the starting. I can press the tab key to go into edit mode. I can scale the whole thing up in edit mode, and then go back to object mode. And then I can hit the space bar again, and it will re-simulate. Or you can just click on the delete bake, and then hit the bake button again to bake the simulation. So then once it's at a frame that you like, you can pause the animation. And you can click right over here to the modifier properties. And you can see it's actually given a cloth modifier. And we want to apply this modifier. So you can just click on the dropdown, and then click on apply. So now if I tab into edit mode, you can see the geometry is actually set in that position. And then also using the object context menu, I can shade this object smooth. Now I want to give this some thickness, because right now it actually doesn't have any thickness. So let's click on add modifier. And under generate, I'm going to add the solidify modifier. And I can just turn it up just a little bit, so it has a tiny bit of thickness. So something like that. And then also to give it more geometry and smooth it out, I can press control 2. Control 2 is the shortcut key to add a subdivision surface modifier. And you can see now it's smoothing that all out, and it looks much more like fabric or cloth. And that is really it for the cloth object. And then also I added in a camera and some lights. So I just added this camera here, and I pointed the camera at the object. And I can actually bring the camera down, bring it out a bit, so it's pointed at the object. And then I'm going to click right over here to go to the shading workspace. So in the shading workspace, I have the 3D space here, and the shader editor here. And I'm going to hold down the Z button and go into the rendered view. Now for the lighting, I added in a few area lights here. So if you press shift A, you can go down here to light, and you can add the area lights. And I just positioned the area lights around, and I made some of them longer by changing the shape here to rectangle. And then you can drag up the size X and Y. And I turned up the power so that the lights are much more strong. And I also gave the lights a very slight blue color. So I have a light over here, then I have another light over here, and then I have this main light right here. And then also to get some nice reflections and more realistic lighting, If you click right over here to the world properties, I added in this Skylit Garage 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Link will be in the description if you'd like to download it. So if you add a new world, you can click here on the color, click on the yellow dot, and you can choose environment texture. And then you can click on open and open up the downloaded HDRI. And again, on polyhaven.com, I downloaded the 1K HDR version. And then if you don't want to be able to see the HDRI in the background, you can click right up here to go to the render properties, and you can open up the film tab right here. And then if you open up the film tab, you can checkmark the transparent. And that way you can't see the HDRI in the background. And then also to make the colors look a bit nicer, if you scroll down to the bottom and open up the color management, the view transform should be set to filmic. And then on the look here, I'm going to change this to high contrast. And this will pop out the colors and make it more contrasty and saturated. And then I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click on edit, and you can go to the preferences. And then over there on the add-ons tab, just search for Node Wrangler, and you can checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So we can now just select the object here. You can click on new to add a new material, and I can rename the material. So to start off, I want to make a very detailed texture for the weaves of fabric. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for a wave texture. Let's drop the wave texture right here. And then we turned on the Node Wrangler add-on. So I can hold down the control and shift key, and then select different nodes. And that is going to preview the texture on the object. And then also with the wave texture selected, I'm going to press control T. And that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I don't need the mapping, so I can actually click on it and press X to delete it. And then right here on the wave texture, I want to click on the X here. And I want to change this instead to Y so that it's going back and forth. Now normally when I'm creating procedural materials, I like to use the object coordinates. So we can take the object, and we can put that into the vector. And the object coordinates helps to place the texture on the object more evenly. And so it works really well for procedural materials. And it's also really good when you want some material that you can add to many different objects. There is a problem though with using the object coordinates for this cloth material. The cloth has a consistent pattern. And so you can see right over here on the top, it looks pretty good. But then right over here, kind of when there's a warp in the fabric, it looks really weird and it's all stretching. And also right over here, you can see it looks really weird and it's all stretching. And we're also going to need to turn the scale up because we want the cloth to be very detailed. So I'm going to turn the scale up to like a 250. And you can see we're still having a lot of problems even though the scale is turned up. So because we're using the object coordinates, it's like making this weird circle here. It looks good from the top. You can see that the lines of the wave texture are going back and forth. But it looks really weird over here where there is some warping in the texture. And so this is why I'm going to be using the UV coordinates instead. So I'm going to take the UV and put that into the vector. And now you can see that it's all straight and it's very consistent. So you can see now the wave texture moves along consistently with the shape of the fabric. And so that's why we need to use the UV coordinates and we need to have a decent UV unwrap for our object. So now let's continue to change some of the wave texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to 250, but you can change that to whatever scale you want for the size of your object. And then on the distortion here, I'm going to turn this up to like a 7. So if I zoom way in to see this closer, you can see that's what the distortion is doing. So it's kind of adding those little wobbles there. And then on the detail, I'm going to turn this all the way to the max of 15. And then all the other settings I'll leave at the default. So this is looking pretty cool, but I want to make it a bit more contrasty. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's put the color ramp here after the wave texture. And then I'm going to click on this black tab here and I'm going to drag this out. And you can see when I drag it out, it's going to make it more contrasty. And so those little black lines there are a bit stronger and they're a bit bigger. So I'll just place that color ramp tab to about there. So we now have some fabric weaves which are going back and forth. But I also want some weaves of fabric which are going up and down. So I'm going to click and drag to box select the color ramp and the wave texture. And I'm going to press Ctrl-Shift-D. So Ctrl-Shift-D will duplicate the nodes, but it'll keep the wires plugged up. So then to preview this one, I can Ctrl-Shift and select this color ramp to preview it. And I'm going to click on this Y here and I'm going to change it to X. And so this way it's going to be going up and down. So I now want to join these two textures together. So to do that, I can select this color ramp. And then I can hold down the Shift key and select this other color ramp. I can now press Ctrl-0. And Ctrl-0 is going to add this mix RGB. We can click on the arrow to open it up. So the mix RGB is going to mix these two colors together. So the top one can go into color one and then the bottom color ramp can go into color two. And the mix here is going to blend between them. So we can blend between the first one and the second one. But I want to leave the factor at 0.5 so it's evenly blending between them. And so now we have the weaves mixed together. Now, if you want to ever change the size of the weaves, you'd want to change the scale together so that the size is consistent. So to do this, I can press Shift-A. I can go here to the search and I'm going to search for a value node. And let's put the value node right here before both of the wave textures. So I can plug this value up to both of the scale values. So this one here and also this one here. So now we have this single value and the single value is going to change the size of both of the wave textures. So if I change this, it'll change the size together so it'll stay consistent. So I can now just change this to a 250. But you can of course change this to whatever size you want or whatever size works best for your object. So you might want to go with like a 300, maybe a 400 or a 500. Or maybe you want to make the weaves bigger. You could just change this down to 100. I'm going to go with 250. All right, so we now have our weave texture. So I'm going to take the mix here and I'm going to put the color into the base color of the principled shader. And then to preview the principled shader, I can Control-Shift and select it to preview it. Now, I want to change the colors because right now this is very bright. So I'm going to just select one of these color ramps and I can press Shift-D to duplicate. And let's put it right here between the mix and the principled shader. So now we can change the colors here and that'll actually change the color of the fabric. So with the color ramp selected, you can hit the backspace and that's just going to reset the color ramp. So I want to leave this tab here as black. But then this tab right here, I want to make this the color of the fabric. So I'm going to make my fabric a very dark blue. So I can click on the color here and I'm going to make it a strong blue color and then I can make it very dark. But of course, you can change this to whatever color you want. So if you want a green fabric, you can change it to green. You can also change the brightness, really just change this to whatever color you want. But I'm going to make this a dark blue. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using for this dark blue, you can click over on the hex value and you can punch in 001333. So this fabric is very reflective. It almost looks like plastic because it is so shiny. So what I want to do is take this mix here and I want to put it into the roughness so that it'll control the amount of roughness. Now, that's just making it look more shiny. And so I need to change the colors to change how rough and shiny I want the texture to be. So what I can do is just click on any of these color ramps and I can press Shift D to duplicate it. And I'm going to put it here in between the mix and the roughness. And then to clear or reset the color ramp, I can hit the backspace and that'll reset the color ramp. So I can now change these colors and that'll change how shiny the cloth is. So if you make the colors more white, they're going to be more rough. So I can click on the black tab here and click on this color. And I'm going to turn this up and I'm going to make it much more rough because cloth isn't very reflective, it isn't very shiny, it is pretty rough. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, over here on the hex value, you can punch in ADADAD. Now, you can see that this cloth is still pretty reflective and it is very white. Even though this color ramp is super dark, it's still pretty reflective. So I'm going to turn this specular down. So I'm going to turn the specular down to just like a 0.1 and that way it is much darker and it will be less reflective. Now, I want to make this look a bit more soft and make it look a bit more like fabric. So to do that, I'm going to turn up this sheen value. So I'm going to turn the sheen value all the way to 1. And also on the sheen tint here, I'm going to turn that all the way up to 1 as well. So if you kind of look here on the sides of the fabric, if I click and then drag down, I can drag this back and forth and this way I can change the sheen and the sheen tint at once. So if I turn up the sheen tint, you can see it looks more like fabric and it looks a bit more soft. So that is looking nice. So this is definitely starting to look like fabric, but it is very smooth. And so I want to add some values into the normal to give it some bump. So I'm first going to take this mix here and I'm going to take the color and I'm going to put that into the normal. Now we need to convert this to normal data because if you zoom in here, you can actually see there's some weird shading issues and that's because this is color data, but this needs to be normal data. So to convert this to normal data, I can press shift A. Let's go here to the search and I'm going to search for the bump node and we want to put the bump node in between the mix and the normal. And then we actually want to put the color into the height value and that way it'll convert the weave texture into normal data. So now the weaves look like they're actually bumpy, but that is a bit too strong. So I can take the strength and I'm just going to turn that down to like a 0.4. So it's a bit less strong, but now the weaves of fabric look like they're actually bumping out. And so that is looking much more realistic now. Now I also want to add two more layers of bump. I want to add a little bit of noise all over the fabric just to make it look more noisy. And then I also want to add another layer of bump, which is going to make it look a bit more like fabric and make it look a bit fuzzy and soft. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go here to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And let's put the noise texture underneath the wave texture. And then you could use the object coordinates if you wanted to, but I'm just going to use the UV. So I can take the UV and I can put that into the vector. So now let's control shift and select the noise texture and I want to play around with some of the settings. So I'm going to turn the scale up to like a 50 so that you can see much more of it. And then I also want to turn the detail up to the max of 15. So it's very detailed. So I now want to take this noise texture and I want to put it into the bump just to give a little bit of noise all over the material. So I can click on this bump here and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and let's stick it here after this first bump. So the normal can go through the normal and so we now have this extra height value that we can use to add data into. So let's take the factor from this noise texture and we're going to put that into the height of this second bump. And then I can actually control shift and select this bump to preview it. Now that is way too strong. So I'm going to take the strength and I'm just going to turn this way down to a 0.15 and that way it is much more subtle. And if you want to preview what this is doing, you can select the bump and you can press the M key and that'll mute the node and then you can press the M key again to unmute it. So if I mute it, you can see there is the first bump. So that's just using the weave texture and then I can hit the M key again and it's just going to add a little bit of noise all over the fabric. And then I also want to add one more layer of bump to make it look a bit fuzzy. So I can click on this noise texture and I'm going to press control shift D. So control shift D will duplicate the node, but it'll keep the wire plugged up. And then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Now for this one, I want this to be much more detailed. So let's turn the scale up to 500 so that it is very small. And then to make it look kind of fuzzy, I want to turn the distortion up. So I'm going to turn the distortion up to 1. And now if you zoom in here, you can see it looks all wobbly and distorted. So I now want to put this into the bump as well. So I can click on this bump node and I can press shift D to duplicate it and I can just drop it here so the normal can go through the normal. So we now have another height value. So I can take the factor of this noise texture. I'm going to bring out the wire and I'm going to stick it into the height value of this third bump. And then I can control shift and select this bump to preview it. So you can kind of zoom in here and see what it's doing. And I do want to make it a bit more strong because it is pretty subtle. So let's turn the strength to like a 0.3. So now if I zoom in there, if I zoom up pretty closely, you can see there's all that distortion and that's going to make it look a bit more fuzzy. And so by adding these three layers of bump together, it looks a lot like fabric. So I can now control shift and select the principal shader to preview the final material and I can bring the material output back. So there we go. We now have a nice very detailed procedural fabric material. So I hope you found this tutorial helpful and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPsP7ZlTbn8,Procedural Sci-Fi Alien Metal (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural sci-fi alien metal material, inspired by a previous tutorial on creating a sci-fi alien orb using geometry nodes. The tutorial covers setting up a 3D space with basic objects, lighting, and HDRI for realistic reflections. It explains how to build the metal and emission materials and combine them using nodes for a detailed look, including how to add displacements for depth. The tutorial concludes with a compositing step to add a glow effect, and offers project files for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon, along with additional resources for learning procedural material creation.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural sci-fi alien metal material in Blender. And I got the idea for this material from my sci-fi alien orb geometry nodes tutorial. So it's a tutorial which I recently posted on how to create this looping animation of this alien orb using geometry nodes. And so I had two different materials, a metal material and a glowing material. And so I thought it would be cool to join both of those materials together and create this sci-fi alien metal. If you'd like to purchase the project files, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store in my Patreon page with the links in the description. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my materials. And if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist with the link in the description. So before we create the procedural material, I wanted to show you what I have set up in the 3D space if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I pressed Shift-A, I went here to Mesh, and I added a plane and also a cube just so that I have something to preview the materials on. And then with both of these objects, if you tab into edit mode, you can use the object context menu and you can subdivide the objects. And I subdivided these objects many times so that they have lots of geometry. And why I did that is because I'm going to be using the displacements in the node editor to actually displace the mesh. And so it needs more geometry so that the displacements have more detail to work with. So if you want to use the displacements, I would recommend subdividing your mesh. And then I just positioned the cube and the plane right here. And then I also added a camera and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And then to get some nice lighting, I added this area light right here and I scaled it up really big. And then I turned the power up to 400. And then I gave it this cool, like slightly greenish, bluish color to kind of look like maybe some alien kind of greenish lighting. And then I also added this light right here. So this is another area light with the power of 400 and kind of this greenish color. And then on this one, I turned the shape here to rectangle and I turned up the X size so that it is longer. So it kind of acts like a rim light and just gives some nice lighting here on the side of the objects. And then to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections over here on the world properties, I added in this Skylit Garage 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. I'll have the links in the description if you'd like to download it. So if you add a new world, right here on the color, you can click on the yellow dot and you can choose environment texture. And then you can click on the open button and open up the downloaded HDRI. And then to make it darker, I just turned the strength to 0.2 because I didn't want it to be too bright. And then also if you go up here to the render properties, if you want the background to be transparent, then you can open up the film tab right here and you can click on the transparent button. And that way you won't be able to see the HDRI in the background. And then also to make the lighting and the colors a bit nicer, if you go to the color management, you can use the filmic view transform and then also you can change the look here to high contrast. And this will pop out the colors and make everything more saturated and contrasty. So now let's go over the displacement settings. So if you want to use the displacements in the node editor and actually have it displace the mesh, so actually have it pop out the mesh, then you will need to use the cycles rendering engine. So right up here on the render properties, make sure this is cycles. And then I'm going to be using the adaptive displacement. So if you want to use the adaptive displacement, you'll need to set the feature set here to experimental. And then you can click on the object. So I'm just going to click on the plane here and you can go right over here to the modifier properties. And you can click on add modifier here. And I'm going to add the subdivision surface modifier. So this is going to subdivide the mesh even more. It already is pretty subdivided, but I want to add the subdivision surface modifier to give it even more detail. And then I also clicked on simple right here, because if you change it to the Catmull-Clark, then the edges are actually going to be round. So if you click on simple, then the edges will be straight. And then to use the adaptive subdivision, you can checkmark the adaptive subdivision right there. And you'll see the adaptive subdivision setting if you have the feature set set to experimental. And then also I just set the dicing scale to 10 because I didn't need it to be too high detail. And then I did the same thing for this cube. So on the cube, you can click on add modifier and add at the subdivision surface. And I set the Catmull-Clark instead to simple. And I also turned on the adaptive subdivision with the dicing scale set to 10. So now let's add a new material. So I'm in the shading workspace. So I have the 3D space right here, and I am in the rendered view. And then I have the shader nodes over here. And I'm just going to click on the new button to add a new material. Now we need to tell this material that it can use the displacements. So let's click right over here to go to the material properties, and I'm going to scroll down to the settings. So to tell this material to use the displacement, if you open up the surface here under settings, we can click on the displacement here, and we want to set this to displacement only. And then before we create the procedural material, I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you don't have that enabled, you can click on edit, and then you can go to the preferences and then click on the add-ons tab. And you can search for Node Wrangler and then just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, I'm going to create a cool sci-fi metal texture for the material. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for the brick texture, and let's drop it down here. And then because we turned on the Node Wrangler add-on, I can hold down the ctrl and shift key and select different nodes, and that is going to preview the node on the object. So I'm going to ctrl shift and select the brick texture. And then also with the brick texture selected, I'm going to press ctrl T. That's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I don't need the mapping, so I can select it and press x to delete it. And then I want to use the object coordinates. So let's take the object, and I'm going to put that into the vector of the brick texture. And then I want another node in here to distort the vector of the brick texture. So if we add another node in here, then that node will distort the placement of how the brick texture is being placed on the object. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture. And let's stick the Voronoi in between the object and the brick texture. And then I want to change some of the settings of the Voronoi. So let's click on the 3D, and I'm going to change this instead to 4D. And then I'm going to click on the F1, and let's change this to F2. And then let's click right here on the bottom drop down, and I'm going to change this to the Chebyshev. So the Chebyshev, if I ctrl shift and select the Voronoi texture, you can see the Chebyshev is making all these little squares here. So I want to take the distance from the Voronoi, and I want to put that into the vector of the brick texture. And then I can ctrl shift and select the brick texture to preview it. And you can see what it's doing. So we're getting this really cool procedural sci-fi metal texture. And if you want to change the randomness, you can change the W here, and that's just going to change the randomness of that texture. And then right here on the Voronoi texture scale, I'm going to turn this to a 3 because I think 3 is a bit better. Now let's change some of the colors of the brick texture. So I'm going to click on color 1 here, and I'm just going to turn this down a little bit so it's kind of like a light gray. Let's click on color 2, and I'm just going to make this like a little bit brighter so it's kind of like a medium gray. And then the mortar here, I'm going to turn this up a bit so it's just kind of like a dark gray. So something like that. So I now want to put this brick texture into the base color of the shader. So let's pull out a wire from the brick texture color, and we're going to put that into the base color. And then I can ctrl shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now this is going to be a metal material. So to make it metal, I want to take the metallic, and I want to turn this up to 1 so that it is fully metallic. And we can also turn the roughness down a little bit to make it more shiny. But I don't just want to use a single value, a single roughness value. I want some parts to be a little bit more rough, and other parts to be a little bit more shiny. So what I'm going to do is press shift A. Let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And let's put the noise texture above the voronoi. And then I can ctrl shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And I want to use the object coordinate. So let's put the object into the vector, and that way it'll be placed on the objects more evenly. And then I want to make this noise texture very detailed. So let's turn the detail to the max of 15. So I can now take the factor here, and I'm going to stick this into the roughness of the principled shader. And then I can ctrl shift and select the principled shader. So now you can see some parts are more rough, whereas other parts are more shiny. But I want to be able to control this better. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go to the search, and let's search for a color ramp. I'm going to click on the color ramp, and let's drop it here in between the noise texture and the principled shader. So I can now change these colors, and that's going to change how rough and shiny the values are. So I'm first going to click on the white tab, and I actually want to drag the white tab out just so that it's a bit more contrasty. And then I can click on the white tab here, and I can make it darker. You can see if I make it darker, it's going to be much more shiny. So I just want to make this kind of like a light gray, something like that. And then I don't want this black tab to be fully black. So I'm going to click on the color here, and I'm just going to turn up a little bit so it's just a very dark gray. Now I also want to put some data into the normal to give it some bump. So I'm first going to take the noise texture here. I'm going to take the factor, and let's put that into the normal. Now you can see there's some weird shading issues. It looks super black, and that's because this is black and white data, but then this here is normal data. So we need to put a node in here to convert this into normal data. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a bump node. And let's put the bump node in the wire between the noise texture and the normal. And then we actually need to put this into the height value. So put the noise texture into the height of the bump so that it's actually converting it to normal data. And now it looks super bumpy, but that is way too strong. So let's turn the strength way down. And so I'm going to turn the bump strength to a 0.02 so that it is very subtle, but it will just give a little bit of bump and noise to the metal. Now I also want this brick texture here to be going into the bump. So let's click on this bump node, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate. And let's stick it after the first one. So the normal can go through the normal. So we now have another height value that we can add data into, and it'll be converted to normal data. So let's take the color here from the brick texture, and I'm going to put that into the height. And then we need to make this stronger. So I'm going to turn this up. And you can see now those little edges look like they're actually popping out. So I'm just going to turn the strength of this one to just like a 0.2 so it is a bit subtle, but those edges look like they're popping out now. You can especially see it right here in the reflections of the plane. And that is it for the base metal. So what I'm going to do is click and drag. That's going to add a box select. And I'm just going to drag and then let go. And that's going to select all these nodes here. I don't want to select the material output or the texture coordinate, but all the other nodes. I can now press control J. And control J is going to add this frame right here. And I can actually bring these in a little bit just to compact them, make them a bit smaller. And so this is just a nice way to organize the nodes. So I can drag this around. And this is all the base metal. So now I'm going to be creating another material. And that is going to be the emission. And then we're going to mix them together. So to create the emission material, I'm going to press shift A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to start by searching for the emission shader. Let's put the emission shader right here above the principal. And then I can control shift and select the emission shader. And we can preview it. Now I want to add a little bit of noise into it. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for the noise texture. And let's bring the noise texture over here. And then I want to use the object coordinates. So let's take the object. And we're going to put that into the vector of this noise texture. And then I want to take the factor of the noise texture. And I can put that into the color of the emission. So now the emission is emitting the color of the noise texture. And then I want to change some of the settings of the noise texture. So let's just turn the scale here to like three so that it's a bit smaller. And then I want to change the colors of the noise texture. Because right now it's just white and black. So let's press shift A. I'm going to go here to the search. And I can search for the color ramp. Let's click on the color ramp and put it in between the emission and the noise texture. And then I want to click on the black tab here and click on the color. And you can of course make this whatever color you want. But to make it look like an alien sci-fi metal, I'm going to make this a bright green color. Maybe just make it a little bit darker. And then I'm going to click on this white tab. And this one is going to be a similar color. So it's going to be green and it's going to be bright. But it's going to be a little bit more yellow. And I could also take this green tab and drag it over to make it a bit more contrast. And if you want to use the exact same colors that I'm using for the green colors For this lighter green, I'm going to be using a hex value of 6AFF24. So you can punch in that value if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using. And then for the slightly darker green, if you click on the color and go to the hex, I'm going to be using a hex value of 1BC600. And then I do want to make the emission much brighter. So let's turn the strength to like a 10 so it is very bright. So now we have this very bright green. And it is looking a bit blown out, but it really will look nicer if it's much brighter. And it will also help for adding a glow in the compositor to actually make the brighter parts glowing. So that is it for the emission material. So I'm just going to click and drag to box select all these nodes. And I can press Ctrl J and that is going to join them together into a frame. And I can even compact these, just kind of bring them in a little bit. So we now have both of these shaders. And so I want to mix them together. And so to mix them together, I can first select the emission and then hold down the shift key and select the principled shader. So they're both selected. I can now press Ctrl 0. And Ctrl 0 is using a feature of the Node Wrangler add-on. And it's going to add this mix RGB. So I can just bring this over here, bring the material output back. And so we're basically mixing between these two. So I can drag the factor. And that's going to blend between either using the emission or using the principled. But I don't want to evenly blend between them. I want some areas to have the emission, but then most places to be the metal. So what we're going to do is use a texture. We're going to put the texture into the factor. And that'll tell it where it's going to be the emission and where it's going to be the principled. So let's take this brick texture right here. We're going to take the color and let's put that into the factor. Now it's not very clear where the metal is and where the glowing parts are. So I need to make it more contrasty. So let's press Shift A, go here to the search. And I'm going to search again for another color ramp. Let's click on the color ramp. And I'm going to drop it here in this wire. And you can see it also brought it here into this frame. So what I'm going to do is press Alt P. And Alt P is going to break it off from the frame. And I can actually stick it up here in this frame. You don't have to put it in a frame if you don't want to. But I'm going to stick it up here in this frame. So the brick texture is going into this color ramp. And then it's going into the factor. And so because the texture is going into the factor, it's going to tell it where it's going to be the emission and where it's going to be the principled. So I can drag these together to make it more contrasty. And then I actually want to make this consistent because I don't want any even blending in the colors. So I'm going to click on the linear here. And I can change this to constant. And then I can just kind of drag these around. And I can tell it how much I want it to use. So I'm actually going to drag the black tab over. I'm going to bring the black tab over to about here. And then I'm going to drag the white tab over. And I want to make another white tab. So what I can do is hold down the Control key and click right here in the white area. That's going to add another tab. And I can bring this tab over and just kind of play around with where this is. And I need to bring the black tab over a little bit. And then I can kind of bring these white tabs together. And I don't actually want that much emission because that's a bit too much. So I will crush these together a little bit. And this is how I like it. So I like having a few lights here and there. But I want it to mostly be the metal. All right. So we are almost done with this material. But I also want to add the displacements to make the mesh actually be popping out. So to do this, I'm actually going to take this Voronoi texture here and duplicate it. So select the Voronoi texture. And I can press Control-Shift-D. So Control-Shift-D will duplicate it. But it'll keep the wire plugged up. And then I want to break it off here from the frame. So I can press Alt-P. And that will bring it out of the frame. And I can stick it down here. And I'm bringing it down here so it can go around and then go up here to the displacement. And then on this Voronoi texture, I want to take the scale here. And I'm just going to turn this to like a 5. But I'll leave everything else at the default. Now I'm going to need to convert this Voronoi texture data into displacement data. So let's press Shift-A. I'm going to go here to the search. And I can search for the displacement node. Let's put this here. And then I want to take the distance. And I want to put that into the height value of the displacement. And then I can drag the displacement over here. And I want to put the displacement into the displacement here on the material output. So I can drag this down. And then I want to put the displacement into the displacement of the material output so it can actually use the displacements. So that is looking really crazy. It's way too bumpy right now. So let's just turn this scale value way down on the displacement. So for now, I'm just going to turn the scale to 0.2. Now I want to make this displacement value more contrasty. Because if I zoom in closely and look at the displacement, you can see the edges are very rounded and beveled. And it looks a bit too smooth. And I want the displacements to have much more sharp edges. So to make this more contrasty, let's press Shift-A, go to the search. And I can, again, search for a color ramp. And let's put the color ramp in between the Voronoi texture and the displacement. So I can then drag these values together. And by dragging these values together, it's going to make that more contrasty. And so the displacements will be much more sharp. So I'll drag the black tab to about here and the white tab over to about here. So now if you zoom up closely, you can see there is a small bevel. But it is much more sharp. So now the displacement is much too strong. So let's go back over here to the displacements. And I just want to turn the scale value even more down. And I'm going to use a scale value of 0.07. I think 0.07 looks pretty good. So you can now see that it's actually displacing the mesh. So if I zoom up closely here, you can see there's all these little sci-fi bits. And it's actually displacing the mesh. And that looks super cool. And it also looks really cool here on the plane. There's all these little bumpy parts and all these little cubes popping out. So that is it. That is the procedural sci-fi alien metal material. So I'm going to render this. And then after I render this, I'm going to do some compositing to make the lights glowing. So I will click on Render and then click on Render Image. And the render has finished. And that definitely looks really cool. So now let's do some compositing to make it glow. So I'm going to click right over here to go to the Compositing tab. And then click on Use Nodes so you can use the compositing nodes. And also click on a backdrop here so that you can preview it in the background. And then you can hold down the Control and Shift key and select different nodes. And again, that's going to use the Node Wrangler add-on. And it's going to add this viewer node so we can actually preview the compositing in the background. And then what I can also do is hold down the Shift key. And I can right-click and drag. And I can drag a line here over these wires and let go. And that's going to add a reroute so we can now just add nodes here in this single wire. So I'm first going to press Shift-A, go here to the search. And I'm going to search for the denoise node. Let's put the denoise node after the render layers. And I can also just change it to fast because I find that it doesn't really affect the quality. So that's going to smooth out the image and make it look nicer. So I can now press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search. And I want to search for the glare node. Let's click on the glare node. And I can stick this after the denoise. And then I want to click on the streaks. And I instead want to use the fog glow. And then I can take the medium here. And I'm going to turn that to high. And then I also want to make the background black so it's not using any transparency. So on this viewer node and the composite, I can just uncheck the use alpha. And that way, it's not going to use any alpha channels. And so the background is just going to be black. So then to save the final image, you can press the F11 key. And that's going to take you to the image editor. And you can click on the render result. And I'm going to change it to the viewer node so we can preview the final compositing. And then to save this, you can click on image. And you can click on save as and save the image. So that's it for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed this. And thank you for watching.

So before we create the procedural material, I did just want to show you what I have set up in the 3D space if you want to set it up the same way that I have. So I'm going to press Shift A, let's go here to Mesh, and I'm going to add an icosphere. And then before you click away or move the icosphere, right behind me, you can click on that little Add Icosphere setting. And on the subdivisions here, I'm going to turn this up to a 6, because I want it to be very subdivided. And then I can just click on the arrow to close this. And I want this to be very subdivided, because I am going to be using the displacements in the Node Editor to actually displace the mesh. And so I do want very detailed topology, so that the displacements can actually displace the mesh and make it kind of bumpy. And then using the Object Context menu, I can shade this smooth. So I'm going to use this to model a basic avocado, and then we'll apply the material to it. So how I modeled the avocado is I just pressed the Tab key to go into Edit mode. And then you can press the O key, or you can click on this button right here. And this is going to turn on the proportional editing. So I can now just select a vertex on the top, and I can press G to grab. And then I can hit Z to bring it up on the Z axis. And I'm going to scroll with my scroll wheel to just pull along more of the vertices. And that is the feature of the proportional editing, it's going to pull along vertices nearby it. I could also hit S to scale, kind of scale the whole thing up a little bit on the top there. And then kind of bring down the top, and maybe scroll with my mouse wheel to bring that down. I could also do the same thing for the bottom here. So I could press G to grab, bring the bottom down, and then press G to grab again, and bring it up on the Z axis. But this time I can bring my scroll wheel down to make the proportional editing smaller, so it's a bit more flat. And then also I could just select some parts here and kind of bring them out to the side. And also just make it a bit more random, because avocados are just a little bit bumpy and a little bit random. So I'm just going to select some of the vertices here, and press G to grab, and kind of move them around just so that it's a bit more organic and random and natural. And then I think I also might want to flatten the top a bit, so I will actually select a vertex on the top here, and I'm going to scale it on the Z axis, and just flatten the top a little bit. And maybe even bring in the sides a little bit. Bring in the sides here, something like that, so that it's a bit more the shape of an avocado. And then I also like previewing the procedural material on a sphere, so I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to add another icosphere, and this icosphere has the subdivision of six levels, so I can press G to grab, move this over here, and I'm just going to place it behind the avocado. And I'll also scale it up a little bit so it's a bit bigger. And then to keep the scale of the procedural materials consistent between the two objects, once I've scaled this up, I'm going to hold down the Shift key and select both objects, and I can press Ctrl-A, and I'm going to apply the scale. And then also this object here, I need to shade it smooth with the object context menu. And then I also added a camera here, and I just pointed the camera at the objects. And then to make everything look a little bit more flat, if you click on the camera and go to the camera settings, I turned the focal length up to 80, just so that it looks a bit more flat. And then also to get some nice lighting, I added in these three rim lights here, so if you press Shift-A, you can go down here to light, and you can add the area light. And so I put these area lights behind the objects, and I gave them a very slight blue color, and then I also changed the shape to rectangle, and I changed the X size here to make them kind of long. And I also turned up the power so they're pretty strong. And this is going to give some nice blue rim lighting on the side of the objects. And then to get a nice bright main light, I added another light here, and this one I turned the shape to an ellipse, and I turned the power way up to 3000. And also on the color here, I made it kind of a slightly yellow color, but mostly white. And I pointed this down from the right side, pointed down at the objects to get some nice bright lighting. And then also to get some realistic lighting and reflections, right over here on the world properties, I added in this Whipple Creek Gazebo 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download this. If you go to the world properties, you can click on the yellow dot here next to color, and you can click on environment texture. And then you can click on the Open button, and then you can open up the downloaded HDRI. And then if you want to make the background transparent, so you can't see the HDRI in the background, if you go here to the Render Properties, you can open up the Film tab right here. And then you can click on the Transparent checkmark right there, to make the background transparent. So there's the HDRI, but I can just click on Transparent to make the background transparent. And then also to make the lighting and colors just a little bit nicer, right over here on the Render Properties, if you open up the Color Management, I'm going to be using the View Transform of Filmic, and then I'm going to make the look here high contrast. And the high contrast is going to make things more contrasty, and it'll also make the colors a bit more saturated and look a bit nicer. So now let's go over the displacement settings. So I'm going to be using the Cycles rendering engine, because the Eevee rendering engine won't support the displacements. So if you want to use the displacements right here on the Render Properties, you need to make sure you're in the Cycles rendering engine. And then if you want to add even more detail, you could go right here to the Modifier Properties, and you could click on Add Modifier, and add the Subdivision Surface Modifier, and that's going to basically subdivide the mesh, so the material will have even more geometry to work with. But these objects are already pretty detailed, they have a lot of geometry, so this amount of detail will work fine for what I'm doing. So now we need to create a new material. So select one of the objects here, and I'm in the Shading workspace, so I have the 3D space right here, and then I have the Shader Editor right over here. So I'm going to click on the New button to add a new material, and I can just rename the material. Now there is one more really important displacement setting that we need to turn on. So if you click right over here to go to the Material Properties, you can open up the Settings tab right here, and under Surface, on the Displacement right here, we want to change this from Bump Only to Displacement and Bump. And this is going to tell the material that it can use the displacement. And then also right here in the Material dropdown, I'm going to click and drag, and I'm going to drop this avocado material onto the other object as well, so they both have the same material. And then before we get started creating the procedural material, I am going to be using the NodeWrangler add-on. So if you don't have the add-on enabled, you can click here on Edit, and you can open up the Preferences, and then over there on the Add-ons tab, you can just search for NodeWrangler and checkmark the NodeWrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, I want to create some little dots all around the avocado. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the Search, and I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture. Let's drop the Voronoi down here. And then using the feature of the NodeWrangler, I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and then select different nodes. And by holding down the Ctrl and Shift key and selecting different nodes, it's going to plug the wire up to the surface of the material output, and so we can preview what the node is looking like on the object. And then with the Voronoi texture selected, I'm also going to press Ctrl-T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now, we don't actually need the mapping node, so I'm going to press X to delete it. And then let's take the object, and we're going to put the object up to the vector. And I'm using the object coordinates because the object coordinates will place the Voronoi texture on the object more evenly. And then you can see that there's a little bit of sharpness in between those dots there, and I want to make that smooth. So if you click on the F1 right here, I'm going to change this instead to Smooth F1. And so this is going to smooth out those edges which are around the circles. Now, let's also change the scale here because I want more of those circles. So I'm going to turn the scale here to a 23, and that way there's going to be a lot more of those little dots. Now, these dots are very round and smooth, and I want to make them look a bit more organic and natural. So I'm going to be adding in a noise texture, and we're going to use the noise texture to distort the placement of the Voronoi. So I'm going to press Shift A, let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture, and let's drop this right up here. And then to preview it, you can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and select the noise texture. And then again, I want to use the object coordinates, so let's pull out a wire from the object and we're going to put that into the vector. So now let's change some of the noise texture settings. So on the scale here, I'm just going to turn this up to 12, and then I also want to make this very detailed, so let's turn the detail all the way to the max of 15. And then let's add a little bit more roughness here. So on the roughness value, I'm just going to turn this to a 0.55, so there's a bit more roughness. All right, so this noise texture is going to distort the placement of the Voronoi. So to add this into the vector here, I'm going to press Shift A, let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the MixRGB, and we're going to drop the MixRGB node right here between the texture coordinate and the Voronoi. And I can just click and drag to box select these and bring them over. So I can now use the MixRGB to mix two values together. So I'm going to take the color here from the noise texture and I'm going to put that into color 2. And then the object coordinates is going to go into color 1. So then I can Control Shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview what it's doing. So you can see the noise texture is now distorting the Voronoi and so it looks all noisy. And if we change the factor, that's going to change how much of the noise texture it's actually using. So if I turn the factor all the way to 0, it's just using the object coordinates, which is color 1. But as I turn the factor up, it's going to use more and more of color 2, which is the noise texture. And so as we turn the factor up, it's going to distort it more and more. Now you can see that when I drag this, it's kind of moving the texture around. So to make it so it's not moving it around, I can click on the mix here, and I'm going to change this to a linear light. This way I can drag the factor and it's going to distort it, but the texture won't be moving around quite as much. Now I only want the noise texture to distort the Voronoi just a little bit. So I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.04. Just a 0.04, and that way it's going to be very subtle. So you can see the dots are still there. It's mostly the Voronoi texture, but if you zoom in closely, you can see that there's just a little bit of noise around those dots and it's distorting it a little bit. So now it looks much more organic and natural. Now I want to make this more contrasty because it is pretty gray, and I want these lighter parts around the dots to be brighter. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the ColorRamp node, and I'm going to stick this right here after the Voronoi texture. I can also box select these and bring them back a bit. And then make sure you Control-Shift and select the ColorRamp to preview it. So I can now click on the white tab and I can drag this over towards the black tab. You can see as I drag it over, the texture is now more and more contrasty. So I'm just going to drag it to about here so that it's mostly white, but then there's those little black areas. So I'm going to pull out a wire here from the color and I'm going to stick this into the base color of the principled shader, and then I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now that obviously doesn't look like an avocado because an avocado is kind of green and brown, so I want to change the colors. So to do that, I can click on the ColorRamp right here, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it, and then I can drop the ColorRamp right here after the first one. So now we can change the colors of this ColorRamp and that'll actually change the colors for the base color. So I'm first going to select the ColorRamp and then I'm going to hit the Backspace, and that is going to clear or reset the ColorRamp. So I'm going to click on this black tab right here, click on the color, and I want to make this a bit brighter and then it's going to be a green color. So it's going to be a very dark green. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using for this dark green color, if you go over to the hex value, you can punch in a hex value of 12260F. So that is the green color that I'll be using. And you can see it's adding little green dots there. And then I want the rest of the avocado to be a dark brown, so I'm going to click on this white tab right here and click on the color, and I'm going to make this a orangey color and then I'm going to make it very dark. And that's going to make it a dark brown. And again, if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, over here on the hex value, you can punch in a hex value of 161009. So there we go, we now have the color for the avocado. Now I also want to plug this color ramp here into the roughness so that some parts are a bit more rough and other parts are a bit more shiny. So let's pull out a wire here from the color and I'm going to stick that into the roughness. Now I want more control over this because you can see it's way too shiny in some areas and then way too rough in other areas. So I'm going to select this top color ramp here and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it and let's just drop it right down here. And then I want to reset the color ramp. So again, with this color ramp selected, I'm going to hit the backspace and that'll reset it. Now for this black tab right here, I want to make this a bit brighter because you can see if I make the values brighter, it's going to be more and more rough. But if I make it darker, it's going to be more shiny. So I want to make the whole thing a bit more rough, so I'll turn this up a bit. And then I'm also going to click on the white tab and this is way too rough here. So on the white tab, I'm going to drag this down a bit and this is going to make it much more shiny. And if you want to use the same exact values that I'm using over here on this lighter colored tab, if you click on the color, I'm going to be using a hex value of BD, BD, BD. And then over here on the other side on this darker gray color, it is a slightly darker gray. For this color, I'm going to be using a hex value of 9A, 9A, 9A. So now if you zoom in here, you can see some parts are a little bit more rough, whereas other parts are a bit more shiny. Now to make this avocado look a bit more organic and natural, and to make it look more like food, I do want to add a little bit of subsurface scattering. And the subsurface scattering will allow a little bit of light to go through the material. So right here on the principal shader, on the subsurface value, I'm going to turn this to a 0.04. Just a 0.04, so it is a very subtle amount of subsurface. So it will just be a tiny little bit of subsurface, but it will make it look a bit more organic and natural, and make it look a bit more like food. And then I also want to change the subsurface color right here, because I don't want it to be white. So I'm going to click on the color here, and I'm going to make it a green color, and then I'm going to make it very dark. And for the subsurface color, if you want to use the same value that I'm using, if you click here on the color and go to the hex value, I'm going to be using a hex value of 203000. So it's basically just a dark green color, and slightly towards the yellow. Now this avocado is very smooth, and I do want to make it pretty rough on the surface, because avocados are pretty rough and bumpy. And also those little dots there on the avocado need to be popping out. So let's take this color ramp here after the Voronoi. We're going to pull out a wire here from the color, and let's stick this into the normal to give it some bump. Now you can see there's some really weird shading issues, and this is because this is color data, but then this is normal data. So we need a node in here to convert the color data into normal data. So to do this, I can press Shift-A, let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the bump node, and let's drop the bump node right in here between the color ramp and the normal. And then to actually convert this to normal data, we want to put this into the height value. And now it's actually converting it to normal data, and you can see the avocado looks very bumpy. Now you can see the bumps are going back in, and I instead want them to be popping out, so I can click on this invert button to pop them out. And then they are way too strong, so I want to make them more subtle, so we can turn the strength value down to make them less strong. And I'm going to turn the strength value to a 0.13, just a 0.13, so they are pretty subtle. And we're also going to be putting these values into the displacement to actually pop out the mesh. Now I do also want to add some noisy bump all over the material, because you can see in between these dots or these circles, it is still very smooth. So I'm going to select the bump node here, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it, and I'm going to stick it after the first bump. So the normal can go through the normal of this bump, but we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So I'm going to take the factor from this noise texture, and let's put this into the height value of the second bump. And now you can see it's giving some nice bump all over the avocado. And I'm going to turn off the invert button so that it's not inverted, and I do want it to be a little bit more subtle, so let's just turn the strength value to 0.1 on the second bump. So this is looking really cool, and it's definitely looking like an avocado skin, but I still want to add some normal into the displacement. Now, if you don't want to use the displacement, that's totally fine. You could just finish off the procedural material here, but I do want to add the displacement just to make it a little bit bumpy and make it look a bit more realistic. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search, and I want to search for a noise texture. Let's click on this noise texture, and I'm going to drop this down here underneath the other noise texture. And then I can Control-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And then let's take the object here from the texture coordinate, and we're going to put that into the vector, just like the other procedural textures. And then let's change some of the values here. So I'm going to turn the scale to a value of 8, and then I do want it to be very detailed, so let's turn the detail all the way to the max of 15. And then I do want to add a bit more roughness, so let's turn the roughness value to a 0.55. So we are going to put this noise texture into the displacement to give it some noisy bump. And then we will also be mixing in the voronoi texture so that those little dots pop out as well. Now, I want to make this noise texture more contrasty, so I'm just going to select any color ramp right here, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it, and let's drop it in the wire here after this noise texture. And then make sure you Control-Shift and select the color ramp so that you can preview it. And then with the color ramp selected, again, I can hit the backspace, and that will reset the color ramp. So I want to make this noise darker and more contrasty, so I'm going to click on this black tab, and I'm going to drag the black tab out a bit so it's a bit darker. And then I'm also going to click on the white tab here and click on this color, and I'm going to make this kind of a dark gray. And the hex value that I'll be using for this dark gray is going to be 717171. All right, so I now want to put this color ramp here into the displacement, and then we'll also be mixing the Voronoi texture into it. So I'm going to take the color here from the color ramp, and let's stick that into the displacement of the material output. And then I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader. Now you can see it is doing something, but it looks really weird. It's kind of just like jutting off to the side, and that is because this is color data, but then this is displacement data. So we need to put a node in here to convert the color data into displacement data. So to do this, I can press Shift-A, and let's go here to the search, and I can search for the displacement node, and I'm going to stick this here in the wire going into the displacement. And then I can just like drag it down, and I'm going to bring it here underneath the principled shader. And then you can see now it's not really doing anything. It's kind of just bringing the objects over to the side. So I actually want to take the color here from this color ramp, and I want to put this into the height value, and that's going to convert it to displacement data. So now it is working, but the displacement is way too strong. So I'm going to turn the scale value way down, and I'm going to turn the scale value to like a 0.1, so it's much less strong. So now that noise texture that we added into the displacement is just giving a little bit of bump on the edges, but I do also want to mix in the Voronoi texture. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the MixRGB node, and I want to drop the MixRGB right here between the displacement and the color ramp. So the MixRGB will allow us to mix two colors together. So we can now take the color ramp color, and I'm going to plug this into color two of this mix here. And then this color ramp here from this noise texture is going to be going into color one. And then just to preview what it's doing, I can Control-Shift and select the mix shader to preview it. So if I turn the factor all the way up to one, it's just going to use the dots, but then if I drag the factor all the way down to zero, it's just going to use the noise. So I mostly want to use the noise, but I just want to add a little bit of the dots. So I'm going to turn the factor value to a 0.1, and this way it's a nice mix between the Voronoi dots and the noise. So I can now Control-Shift and select the principled shader. Now there is a problem. If you zoom in here, you can see the dots are now going back in, but I instead want them to pop out. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for an invert node. Let's click on the invert node, and I want to drop this in here after the MixRGB. So the invert node is going to invert the values. So the white is going to be black, and the black is going to be white. And you can see now that those little dots there are actually being popped out of the mesh. And that is it. So that is the procedural avocado skin material. So I'll just give this a final render.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Niech2KIWgI,Procedural Rough Metal Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural rough metal material using Blender's tools, such as the Musgrave and noise textures, along with the Node Wrangler add-on. The tutorial includes steps for setting up the scene with an Icosphere and applying HDRI lighting for better previews. The instructor also explains how to adjust texture settings and mix them to achieve the desired rough metal effect. The procedural material is available for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon, and additional materials and tutorials can be accessed through the creator's store and YouTube playlist.","In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural rough metal material in Blender. This procedural material is available for purchase on my Gumroad store, and you can also get access to my procedural materials if you join my Patreon page. And this procedural material was originally created for my Sci-Fi Security Drone Blender tutorial series, so if you'd like to check out that tutorial series, links in the description. And if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material packs, and that's a great way to help support this channel. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, then you can also check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube with the link in the description. So let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So I pressed Shift-A, and I went here to Mesh, and I added an Icosphere, just because I like previewing procedural materials on spheres. And then right behind me, if you click on that little arrow there to open up the Add Icosphere settings right after you add the Icosphere, I just turned the subdivisions up to like a 6 so that it is very subdivided and smooth. And then using the Object Context menu, I just shaded this object smooth. And then I also added a camera and pointed the camera at the Icosphere. Now for the lighting, I am using this Studio Small 02 1K HDRI, and this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, so the link's in the description if you'd like to download it. So if you go here to the World Properties and click on the yellow dot, you can choose Environment Texture, and then you can just click on Open and open up the HDRI. And this will give us some nice lighting and reflections to preview the material. And then if you want to make the background transparent, you can go over here to the Render Properties, and under the Film tab, you can click on the Transparent button, and then if I hold down the Z button to go into the rendered view, you can see the background is transparent. So the HDRI is still lighting up the scene, but the background is transparent. And then also to make the colors a bit nicer, if you open up the Color Management, I'm using the View Transform of Filmic and the Look here to High Contrast, and this will make the colors more contrasty and saturated. So I'm in the Shading tab right here, so I have the 3D space here, and I am in the rendered view. And then also right over here, I have the Shader Editor. And then I will also be using the NodeWrangler add-on in this video, so if you don't have the NodeWrangler enabled, you can click on Edit, and you can go to the Preferences, and then over there in the Add-ons tab, you can just search for NodeWrangler, and just checkmark the NodeWrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So you can just select the object that you want to add the material onto, and let's click on the New button, and I can rename this material. Procedural Rough Metal. So to start off, I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go here to the Search, and I'm going to search for the Musgrave texture, and let's drop this down here. And then we turned on the NodeWrangler add-on, so you can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key, and then select different nodes, and the wire here from the material output is going to go into the node, and this will allow you to preview different nodes on our objects. And then with this texture selected, I can press Ctrl-T, that's using another feature of the NodeWrangler add-on, it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping, but then I don't need the mapping node, because the mapping node is just used to transform the texture, so I can select it and press X to delete it. On the texture coordinate, I want to use the object, so let's put the object into the vector of the Musgrave, and the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the object more evenly. So now let's change some of the settings of the Musgrave texture. So I'm going to turn the scale to 1, but then I want this to be very detailed, to look like rough metal, so let's turn the detail all the way to the max, which is 15. So now it definitely looks more rough in there, but it's still not that rough, it still is a little bit blobby, so let's turn the dimension all the way to 0. And when we turn the dimension to 0, now you can see that it looks super rough and kind of grainy. Now I also want to mix this Musgrave texture with a noise texture. So let's press Shift-A, I'm going to go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the noise texture, and let's put that above the Musgrave. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And let's put the object into the vector as well on the noise texture. Now on the scale here, I'm just going to turn that to 4, and then I want this noise texture to be very detailed, so let's turn the detail all the way to the max of 15. And then I do want to add some more roughness, so let's turn the roughness value to like a 0.7. Now this noise texture is pretty gray, it's not very contrasty, so to make it more contrasty, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go here to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and we're going to stick the color ramp right here after the noise texture. And then I can take the black tab and I can drag it out, and you can see as I do that, it's going to make the noise texture darker and more contrasty. So I now want to join these two textures together to make a very detailed rough metal texture. So to do this, you can select the color ramp, and then hold down the Shift key and select the Musgrave texture. So I can now press Ctrl-0. And Ctrl-0 is using the feature of the Node Wrangler add-on, and it's going to add this MixRGB, so I need to drag this back and drag the principle down here. So you can see by pressing Ctrl-0 with these two nodes selected, it added this MixRGB, and so we can use this to mix multiple colors together. So this color ramp can go into color 1, and then the Musgrave can go into color 2. Now, if I drag the factor, that's going to blend between only using the noise texture or only using the Musgrave texture. But I want to instead just add the dark values together. So I'm going to click on the mix here, and I can change this to darken. So now if I turn the factor to 0, it's just using the noise texture, but then as I turn up the factor, it's going to add the dark values from the Musgrave because we set this to darken. So now we have a very cool, detailed, rough metal texture. So now what I want to do is put this into the principled shader. So I'm first going to pull out a wire from the color, and I'm going to put this into the base color of the principled shader. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now, you can see it's very dark in some areas, and that doesn't look very nice. So I'm going to add a color ramp in here to change the colors. So we can actually just click on this color ramp, and I can press Shift-D to duplicate it, and I'm going to drop it right in here before the base color. And then I'm going to hit the backspace, and the backspace is going to reset the color ramp. Now, I want this metal to be a bit more gray, so I'm going to click on this black tab right here, and I'm going to turn this up so it's actually a pretty light gray color. And if you'd like to use the exact same gray color that I'm using, then you can go to the hex value, and you can punch in a hex value of 9 six times. And then this white tab right here, I'm just going to leave this set to fully white. Now, this doesn't really look like metal, and that's because the metallic value is turned to 0. So let's turn the metallic value all the way to 1, and that way, all of the material is going to be completely metallic. Now, I want to have more control over the roughness, because right now, the roughness is being controlled by this value, but the entire material has the same amount of roughness. But I instead want some parts to be more rough, and other parts to be more shiny. So let's take the color here from the darken, and we're going to put this into the roughness. Now, I want to control this better, because right now, some parts are very shiny, almost like a mirror, but then other parts are super rough. So I want to change the colors, and that'll change how shiny and rough it is. So I'm going to click on this color ramp, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it, and let's put it right here before the roughness. And then just select the color ramp, and I'm going to hit the backspace to reset it. And then I actually want to click on this drop-down arrow, and I'm going to click on Flip Color Ramp. So now the white is over here, and the black is over here. Now, I'm going to click on this black tab, and I just want to make this kind of like a dark gray. And then I'm going to click on this white tab here, and I'm going to make this a bit darker. So if the colors are darker, that's going to make the metal more shiny, but if the colors are lighter, then they're going to be more rough. So I'm just going to make this a bit darker to kind of like a light gray. And if you want to use the same values that I'm using, you can click on this dark gray tab. You can go to the hex, and I'm going to be using a hex value of 5C, 5C, 5C. And then right over here on the lighter color, if you click on the color and go to the hex value, I'm going to be using a hex value of A6, A6, A6. So that metal is looking very cool, but it's very smooth, and I do want to make it a bit rough. So let's take the color here from the darken, and I'm going to put that into the normal of the principal shader to give it some bump. Now when we do that, you can see there's some weird shading issues, and this is because this is color data, but then this is normal data. So we need a node in here to convert the color data into normal data. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A, and let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for a bump node, and we want to put the bump node in between the darken and the normal. So just stick it right there. And then to actually convert this to a normal data, we want the color here to be going into the height value. So now if you zoom into the metal, you can see it's very bumpy and very rough. Now that is way too strong, so on the strength value right here on the bump, I'm just going to change this to like a 0.1, so it's much less bumpy. And there we go, so there is the procedural rough metal material. So I'll just give this a final render now. So thank you for watching this video, and I hope you found the tutorial helpful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AemQqVBGI,Procedural Snowy Ground Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural snowy ground material featuring both soft, powdery snow and hard, icy patches, as well as areas with exposed rocks. The process includes setting up an Icosphere, adjusting lighting with rim lights and sunlight, and using HDRI for realistic reflections. The tutorial covers detailed steps on using the Node Editor for creating snow and rock textures, mixing them, and applying displacements for a realistic look. Additionally, the video offers tips on using the Node Wrangler add-on and managing rendering settings. The creator also promotes purchasing the material and other resources from their Gumroad store and Patreon page.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural snowy ground material in Blender. And so you can see here in the final renders, there's going to be some parts which are more of a soft or powdered snow, and then there's going to be some other parts which are a bit more hard and iced over. And then there's also going to be some patchy areas where there isn't any snow, and where you can't see the snow, there's going to be some rocks popping out. If you'd like to help support this channel and purchase the procedural material, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description.

And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. All the links are in the description. All right, so let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So I pressed Shift-A, and I went here to Mesh, and I added an Icosphere. And then right after you add the Icosphere, before you click away or move it around, you can click on the Add Icosphere settings right behind me. And I turned the subdivision level all the way up to 6. And then I shaded the object smooth with the Object Context menu, so I have a nice smooth sphere to preview the material on. And then I also added some different lights here. So I started off by adding these three rim lights to get some bright lighting on the back of the sphere. And these three rim lights are area lights, and they all have a bright white-blue color and a power of 1000. And then I set the strength to Rectangle, and that's a better shape for rim lights because it covers more of the surface. So you can see those rim lights are giving a nice little blue light along the edges of the sphere. And then I also added this sunlight right here, and I pointed the sunlight shining on the side of the sphere. And for the sunlight, I set the color to kind of like a yellowish color and a strength of 5. And then to get more realistic lighting and reflections, I did add in this HDRI from polyhaven.com, and I'll have a link in the description to the same HDRI if you'd like to download it. So if you go here to the World Properties, you can click here on the color, click on the yellow dot, and you can choose Environment Texture, and you can open up the HDRI that you've downloaded. So I downloaded the 1K HDR version of this HDRI, and again, link is in the description to the HDRI. And then if you click right up here on the Render Properties, and then open up the Color Management, I set the View Transform to Filmic and the Look here to High Contrast. And this high contrast is going to make things more contrasty and saturated, and it'll make the final render look nicer. And then also if you click right here to open up the Film tab, I set this to Transparent just so that I can't see the background. Now I'm also going to be using the Node Editor Displacements to actually displace the mesh. So if you want to use the Node Editor Displacements, then you will need to use the Cycles rendering engine. Because the displacements in the shader nodes will not work in Eevee, so make sure you're using Cycles. And then I am also going to be using the Adaptive Subdivision. So on the Feature Set here, you need to set this to Experimental if you want to use the Adaptive Subdivision. And then to add the Adaptive Subdivision, you can just select the object, and you can go right over here to the Modifier Properties, and you can click on Add Modifier, and you can add the Subdivision Surface Modifier. And then if the Experimental mode is turned on, you can checkmark the Adaptive Subdivision. And then on the Dicing Scale here, I just set this to a 10 because I didn't need a ton of detail because this icosphere is already pretty detailed. So we do also need to add a material and then tell the material to use the displacements. So I am in the Shading tab right here. So I have the 3D space over here, and I am in the Rendered view. And then I have the Shader Editor right here. So I can click on New to add a new material, and then I can rename the material. So now that we've added the material, we're going to click right over here on the Material Properties. And I'm just going to close this tab here, and we want to open up the settings here and then go down to Surface. Now right here, you can see there are some displacement settings, and I want to choose Displacement Only. Now if you wanted to, you could use Displacement and Bump, and so that way it'll also use some of the bump for the displacement. But I just want to use Displacement Only because I find that Displacement and Bump just makes it too bumpy, and I do want some parts of the snow to be a little bit iced over and smooth. So I'm just going to go with Displacement Only. I think that works better for this material. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can click here on Edit, and then you can go to the Preferences, and then head over to the Add-ons tab, and you can go to the Search and search for Node Wrangler, and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. And then just one other thing before I start making the material, right over here on the Modifier Properties on the subdivision surface, I'm going to click on this button right here. It looks like a computer monitor, and that's just going to hide the subdivision surface from the view, and this will speed up the preview in the 3D space. And then when we're doing the displacements, we can turn this back on to preview the adaptive subdivision. But I'll just leave that turned off for now. All right, so to start off, we want to create a texture for the snow. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go here to the Search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's just drop this here, and then with the noise texture selected, I can press Ctrl-T, that's using the Node Wrangler add-on feature, and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now, I don't need this mapping node, so I can press X to delete it, and let's put the object into the vector. And the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the object more evenly. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the noise texture, and that is, again, using a feature of the Node Wrangler add-on. And when you Ctrl-Shift and select different nodes, that is going to preview the node on the object. So just Ctrl-Shift and select the noise texture to preview the factor value. So I'm going to turn the scale value to a 4 on the noise texture, and then I'm going to turn the detail all the way up to the max, which is 15, so it's very detailed. So that's going to be the first texture for our snow, but I also want to add another noise texture to make some more detailed snow. So I'm going to select this noise texture, and I'm going to press Ctrl-Shift-D. So Ctrl-Shift-D is going to duplicate the node, but it's going to keep the wires plugged up to it. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Now, for this top one, I'm going to make the scale a value of 10, and then I'll leave the detail at 15. And then I want to give it a bit more roughness, so I'm going to turn the roughness to a 0.63. So a 0.63, and now there's more detail. So I can now Ctrl-Shift and select between these, and we have two different noise textures. And I now want to combine them together. So I'm going to select the noise texture, hold down the Shift key, and select the other noise texture. And then I can press Ctrl-0, and that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler, and it's going to add this MixRGB. So the MixRGB can be used to mix two textures together. And make sure you Ctrl-Shift and select the MixRGB. Now, I just want to add the dark values from these textures. So I'm going to click on the Mix here, and I'm going to change it instead to Darken. And then I can turn the factor all the way up to 1, and you can see as I turn up the factor, it's going to add more and more of that other texture. So it's just adding the dark values together. So now we have both of those noise textures mixed together, and you can see we have some smaller noise, and then also some bigger noise. So these are the textures for the snow. So I'm going to press B for the box select, and just box select these three nodes. And then I can press Ctrl-J, and that is going to add a frame. And then if I select the frame, I can press F2 to add a label, and I can just rename this to Snow, just to organize the nodes very nicely. So there's the snow texture, but I also want to make the rocks texture. So to do this, let's press Shift-A. I'm going to go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture, and let's stick this up here. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it. And then I also want to use the object coordinate, so let's put the object into the vector, and that way it's going to place the textures on the object more evenly. Then I can bring the texture coordinate out a bit. Now right here on the Voronoi texture, I'm going to turn the scale to like a 40, so it is much smaller. And then this doesn't really look quite like rocks, so I'm going to click on the F1 here, and I'm going to change this to distance to edge. And the distance to edge is going to make this really cool texture here, and it looks like all of these sharp rocks. And that is going to look really cool for a rock texture. Now if I zoom in closely, you can see that the Voronoi texture edges are very smooth, and I want to make them more random and organic and natural looking. So to do that, I can add a texture in here to distort the placement of the Voronoi texture. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search, and I can search for a noise texture, and we want to put the noise texture in between the object coordinates and the Voronoi. And this way, the noise texture is going to distort the Voronoi texture. Now let's change some of the noise texture settings. So I'm going to turn the scale to like a 10, and then I also want it to be very detailed, so let's turn the detail to the max of 15. Now it's distorting it way too much, and I don't want it to be distorted that much. I just want the edges of the rocks to be a little bit distorted. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A, go to the search, and I'm going to search for the Mix RGB, and we're going to stick this after this noise texture. And then I can take the object coordinates, and I'm going to put this up to color 1, and then that way, this noise texture color can go into color 2. So basically, we are mixing the object coordinates with the noise texture. And so we're mixing these two together with the mix, and then that is going to go into the Voronoi. So now I can change the mix factor, and that's going to change how much of the noise texture we're using to distort the Voronoi. So if I turn the factor all the way to 0, you can see the edges are very sharp, and it's not distorted at all. But then if I drag the factor up, you can see it's being distorted more and more. Now, as I bring up the factor value, you can see the rocks are moving around a bunch, and I don't really want the texture to move around that much. So let's click on the mix here, and I'm going to instead change this to the linear light. And this way, when I drag the factor value, you can see the rocks aren't moving around as much, but they're being distorted. So you can see as I turn up the factor, now it's adding more and more noise and distortion to the edges. So I'm just going to go with a very small factor value of 0.05, just 0.05. And now you can see on the edges of those rocks, they look more organic and natural, but they still have some cool chunky rock shapes. So I want to organize my nodes very well. So I'm going to press B for the box select, and just box select all these nodes. And then I can press control J. That is going to add a frame. So they're all now in the frame. And then if I select the frame, I can press F2 to add a label. And I'm just going to rename this to rocks. Now you can see that the rocks are all over the sphere. And I only want them to be in some places here and there, because it's actually mostly going to be snow. But there's just going to be some little patchy areas where you can see the rocks. So I'm going to create a texture as a mask. And then we'll use that to tell the rocks where they're going to be. So I'm going to click on this noise texture here. And I'm going to press control shift D. That'll duplicate it, but keep the object coordinates plugged up to it and stick it up here. And then I can control shift and select it to preview it. Now on the scale here, I'm just going to change this to four. So it is smaller. And then right here on the roughness, I do want to add some more roughness. So I'm going to turn this to a 0.65. And that way there is going to be quite a bit more roughness. And then I'll also leave the detail at 15. So it's very detailed. Now this isn't going to work well for a mask because it is very gray. So I want to make it more contrasty. So to do that, I can press shift A. Let's go to the search. And we're going to search for a color ramp node. And let's stick the color ramp right here after this noise texture. So I can now drag the black tab and the white tab together. And that's going to make it much more contrasty. So I'm going to drag the white tab to about here. And then I'll drag the black tab out to about there. So where the black areas are, that is where you're going to be able to see the rocks. But then everywhere else where it's white, that is where the snow is going to be. So I now want to mix our mask in with the Voronoi texture. So I'm going to select the Voronoi, hold down the shift key, and also select the color ramp. And then I can press Control 0. And that is, again, going to add a mix RGB. I can click on the arrow to open it up. And I'm going to drop it inside the rocks frame and then bring it over. And I can also bring the rocks frame back a little bit and maybe push these together. Now because this is the mask, this is going to tell it where it's going to be the Voronoi texture and then where it's just going to be white. So I'm going to put this color here from the color ramp into the factor. And then I want the Voronoi distance to be going into color 1. So now if I zoom in here, you can see there are just some rocks here and there. But then most of it is that gray color. And this color 2 here, I'm just going to leave it at the default value. And if you go over here to the hex value, that should be a value of BC, BC, BC. So that is the default color that comes in the MixRGB. So I'm just going to leave that to that value. All right, so we now have the snow and we have the rocks. So I want to mix these together. So I'm going to select the dark in here from the snow, hold down the Shift key, and select the mix from the rocks. And then I can press Control 0. And that's going to add another MixRGB. I can click on the arrow to open it up and bring it up here. Now I just want to add the dark values. So if I click on the mix here, I can just change this to darken. And then this mix can be going into color 1. And the snow darken can be going into color 2. So then on the factor here, I can drag this all the way up to 1. And you can see as I drag it up, it's adding that snow texture. And it's just adding the dark values. So now we have the rocks and the snow in their mix together. So I can now take the principled shader. And I'm going to drop this in between them. And then make sure the darken is going into the base color. And then I can drag these up here and drag this up here, maybe bring these over a bit. So this darken is going to go into the base color. So that's going to make the color of the texture. But I want to change the colors because you can see it is very white. There's just some little dark areas around the rocks. But I want to change the colors. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And we're going to stick the color ramp right here in between the darken and the principled. So I can now change the colors of the color ramp. And that's going to change the colors for the material. So I'm first going to add another color in here. So I'm going to hold down the Ctrl key and click right here. And that's going to add another tab. And then if you click on the color here, you can change that color. So I'm going to make this kind of a brownish, dark grayish color. And you can see this color here is changing the colors for the rocks. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, then you can go to the hex value. And you can punch in a hex value of 686261. So that is the color that I'll be using for the rocks. Now, over here, I am going to leave this at black so that the cracks in between the rocks is darker. And then I'm going to click on the white tab. And I'm going to drag this over. And you can see as I drag it over, it's making it more contrasty. And the edges are more sharp. And I also might drag this over just a little bit. So there we go. So there is the color for the texture. Now, I also want to put this texture into the roughness so that some parts are more rough and then other parts are less rough. So let's take the darkened color. And we are going to put that into the roughness. Now, I want to be able to control this better. So I'm going to click on this color ramp. And I can press Shift-D to duplicate it. And we're going to drop it right here. And then I want to reset the color ramp. So with the color ramp selected, I can hit the Backspace. And that's just going to clear the color ramp. And then I actually want to flip these values. Because if I zoom into the material here, I'm just going to kind of go to the edge here. I want the rocks to be a bit more rough. But then I want the snow to be very shiny. So I'm going to drag this white tab over. And then drag the black tab over. And that's going to flip it. So now that these colors are flipped, you can see that the rocks are actually more rough. But then the snow is very shiny. I'm going to drag this over here. And then I want to drag this tab over here. And I do want the rocks to be a little bit shiny. But I might just drag this over just a little bit. So now if you look here on the reflections, you can see the rocks are more rough. But then right over here where the snow is, it's very, very reflective. You can see all that shiny bits there. Now I also want to put some values into the normal to give it some bump. Because right now this material is very smooth. So I'm first going to add the bump for the rocks. So I'm going to take the mix here from the rocks frame. I'm going to pull out a wire here. And I'm going to stick this into the normal. Now you can see there's some weird shading issues. And that's because this is color data. It's a yellow dot. But then this is normal data. You can see this is a purple dot. So we need to convert the color data into normal data. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for a bump node. And we're going to drop the bump node right here in this wire. And I can just drag it down. Now we actually want the mix here from the rocks to be going into the height value of the bump. And that'll convert it to normal data. So if you zoom into the rocks, you can see now they're very bumpy. Now that's a bit too bumpy. So I'm going to turn the strength value of the bump to just like a 0.3. So it's not quite as bumpy. Now I also want to add some bump to the snowy areas. I do want the snowy areas to be less bumpy than the rocks. But I still want them to have a little bit of bump. So I'm going to click on this bump node. And I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it. And I can drop it down here. And then the normal can go into the normal of the bump. So this way we can mix two bump maps together. And so we now have this height value that we can add data into. So I'm going to take the dark in here from the snow. I'm going to take the color. And I'm going to put that into the height value. And now you can see the snow is bumpy as well. Now I do want the snow to be more smooth. So on the strength value right here, I'm just going to turn this to like a 0.15. So it is more smooth. But there is going to be a little bit of bump there and a little bit of noise on the snow. All right. So this material is looking very cool. But it still isn't using any displacements. So to preview the displacements right back over here on the modifier properties, I'm going to click on this little button here that looks like a monitor. And that way it's going to preview the adaptive subdivision. And then I'll just make this smaller. So we've already set up the displacement settings in the beginning of this video. So we now just need to add some values to the displacement of the material output. So I'm going to take this dark in here, which is mixing the rocks and the snow together. And I'm going to put the color into the displacement. And then it might take a moment just for it to load up the adaptive subdivision. All right. So you can see it's working, but it's kind of shooting it over to the side and it's way too strong. And something is definitely not working right. And that is because this dark in here is color data. But then this right here is displacement data. So just like with the bump, we need a node in here to convert the color data into displacement data. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for the displacement node. And let's stick the displacement node right here in between the wire. And then I can just drag it down and stick it here underneath the principled shader. Now we actually want the dark in here to be going into the height value of the displacement. And then we'll just wait for that to load up. And there we go. So the displacement is working now. Now you can see this is way too strong because the snow is coming out a lot. But then where it is darker and where the rocks are, it is going in a lot. So on the scale value here, I'm just going to turn that to like a 0.3. So it is much less strong. So just change that to a 0.3. And that is looking much better. Now, if you zoom in here, you can see that it is still pretty sharp and jagged. And so I want to make these colors less contrasty so that there isn't quite as much sharp values. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And we're going to stick the color ramp right here before the wire goes into the height value. So we can now change these colors and we can actually make them less contrasty. So if they're more of a similar color, then there's not going to be quite as much contrast. So let's first click on the black tab, click on the color here. And I'm just going to make this kind of a dark gray color. And that's looking a bit better. And then let's click on this white tab here, click on the color. And I'm going to make this kind of a light gray. So now these two colors are much closer to each other. And so it's not going to be quite as bumpy. And if you'd like to use the same exact color values that I'm using, then over here in this dark gray, you can go to the color and you can go to the hex. And you can punch in a hex value of 787878. And then if you click right over here on the lighter gray, click on the color. I'm going to be using a hex value of ADADAD. And that is looking a lot better. So it's not quite as bumpy. But if I zoom in here, you can see the rocks are kind of bumping back a bit. And then the rocks are also popping out. But then you can see the snow is popping out a lot more. So that is looking a lot better. Now, I do want there to be just a bunch of little bumps all over just to kind of make the snow look kind of lumpy. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for another noise texture. And let's just put this down here. And I can actually box select these nodes, these three nodes here, and bring them down. And then I can press Control-J with them selected. And that's going to add a frame. And then if I click on the frame, I can press F2 to make a label. And I'm going to rename this to displacement because these are all of the nodes that we're using to create the displacement. So I'm going to use this noise texture to just add some lumps all over the material. Now, I want to use the object coordinates. So let's take the object from the texture coordinate. We're going to put that into the vector of the noise texture. And then if I Control-Shift and select the noise texture, I can preview it on the object. So I'm actually going to leave all the noise texture values to the defaults. So I now want to add the noise texture into the displacements. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for the mix RGB. And we're going to put the mix RGB after this color ramp before it goes into the height value of the displacement. And then I can take the noise texture factor. And we're actually going to put that into the factor of the mix here. And then I want this color ramp here to be going into color 1. And then if I take color 2 on the mix here and I make it darker, you can see the displacements aren't bumping out quite as much. But then if I make this a little bit lighter, it's going to be popping out a bit more. So on color 2 here on the mix, I'm going to be using a hex value of CE, CE, CE. And there it is. So you can see it's all bumpy along the edges there. And that looks really nice. And it looks a lot like snow. So that's really good. So I can now just Control-Shift and select the principal shader to preview the final material. And there is the finished procedural material. And there is the final rendered image. Now, after the image rendered, I did do a little bit of compositing. So let me just show you what I did. So after I rendered this, I went over here to the Compositing tab. And then I first added a denoise node just to smooth out the image and get rid of some of the noise. And then I also added a couple of glare nodes just to kind of make the edges look a bit shiny and make them glow a bit. And then at the end here, I added an alpha over node. And I put this into the bottom image. And then on the top image here, I just made this black just so that it has a black background. So there is the finished procedural material.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFnd7T3lgUE,Procedural Stylized Shader (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to construct a stylized shader that can be applied for comic book or toon-style effects and to display 3D object wireframes. The tutorial covers grouping materials into a shader node, using Node Wrangler for color previews, and setting up lighting rotation to adjust scene lighting. The shader is compatible with both Cycles and Eevee render engines. The tutorial also includes a guide on creating a wireframe effect using basic geometry nodes and applies the material to various 3D shapes and a sci-fi scene. The video concludes by offering the tutorial files for purchase on Gumroad or through a Patreon membership, providing a way to support the creator.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this really cool stylized shader in Blender. And this stylized shader could be used for many things, so it could be used as sort of like a comic book or toon style shader, or it could also be used to show off the wireframe of your 3D objects. And I'll also show you how to group the material into this nice little shader node right here, and then you can just use the Node Wrangler to preview the different color versions. And then I'm also going to show you how to set up this lighting rotation so that you can rotate this Z value, and it's going to rotate the light around. And you can change the lighting to work best for your scene, and you can get some really cool results. And if you'd like to purchase the tutorial files, then I will have links in the description to where you can purchase the tutorial files on my Gumroad store. And you can also get access to the tutorial files if you join my Patreon page. And my Gumroad store and Patreon page are both great ways to help support me and this channel. Now this material looks pretty much exactly the same in both the Cycles rendering engine and the Eevee rendering engine. So I'm going to be using Eevee because it does render faster, but this looks pretty much exactly the same in Cycles as well. Now this is a procedural material, but to get the wireframe effect, I am going to be using a basic geometry node setup. So the final look doesn't come completely from a procedural material. I do use a basic geometry node setup to create the wireframe, and then I add that to all of the objects. And in the video, I will show you how I created the wireframe in Geometry Nodes. So to showcase this stylized material, I'm going to be adding the material onto these different primitive shapes. And then I've also created this cool little sci-fi corridor that I'm adding it onto as well. And then I've also added in my sci-fi mech robot. And I have a complete tutorial series on my YouTube channel on how to create this mech robot. I'll have a link in the description if you'd like to check that out. So I'm now going to click right up here to go to the shading workspace. And so in the shading workspace, I have the 3D space right here, and then I have the shader nodes over here. Now, none of these objects have materials. So what I'm going to do is select one of these objects here, and then I'm going to click on New, and I'll just rename this to Stylize Shader. Now I want all of the other objects in the scene to have the same material, so I'm just going to press the A key to select all the objects, and then I'm going to hold down the Shift key and make sure I select this object last. Then I can press Ctrl-L, and Ctrl-L will bring up the link and transfer data. And I'm going to click on Link Materials. So now if I click on these different objects, they all have the Stylize Shader material. Or for your scene, you can just select the different objects and then click on the drop-down and add the Stylize Shader that you've added. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview different nodes. So if you don't have that enabled, you can click on Edit and then go to the Preferences. And then over there in the Add-ons tab, you can search for Node Wrangler and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. So I'm actually going to click on the Principled Shader, and I'm going to press X to delete it. So I'm now going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the Search, and I'm going to search for the Bevel node. Let's drop the Bevel node right here. And then using the feature of the Node Wrangler, I can Ctrl-Shift and select it to preview it. And then let's also hold down the Z button and go up into the rendered view so we can see what this is looking like. So we are previewing the Bevel's normal, and so this is going to give us a normal output. And what the object's normal is, is it's the rotation of the faces. So you can see as the faces change their rotation, the normal color is going to be different. But you can see right here on both of these planes, it is this dark blue on the ground, and that's because these planes are both pointed upwards. So as the rotation of the faces change, the colors change on the normal. So I can use this to create stylized shading. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go here to the Search, and I'm going to search for a ColorRamp, and we're going to drop the ColorRamp right in here in this wire. And so now you can see it looks black and white. Now you can see on some of the objects, especially these objects over here, which are kind of smoothed out, there is a bit of fading. And so to make this more stylized, I'm going to click on the Linear here, and I'm going to change this instead to Constant. Now when I do that, everything looks black, and that's because I need to click on this white tab here in the ColorRamp, and I need to drag it over. And so this is going to give us kind of that cartoon shading effect. Now I don't just want to use white and black, I do want to have some amount of shading. So I'm going to click and drag and bring the white tab over here, and then I'm going to hold down the Control key and click right in the middle, and that's going to add another tab. And then this tab, I'm going to click on the color, and I'm just going to make this kind of like a gray color. And then I'm going to hold down the Control key and click again to add another tab there. And this color, I can make a little bit brighter as well. And you can see as I start to do this, we're creating a shading effect. So I'm going to hold down the Control key and click again in the ColorRamp to add another tab. And then this one, I'm going to make it a little bit brighter, but kind of still a dark gray. Now if you select an object and rotate it, you can see as I rotate it, it's also rotating the shading. And I do like this, because this way the lighting is consistent. So like right now, it kind of looks like the bright light is over here, and it's shining down on the objects, because the right side of the objects are all the brightest. But if you didn't want this, if you didn't want the lighting to change when the object rotates, then you could instead press Shift-A, go here to the search, and you could search for the texture coordinate node. And I'm just going to drop this up here. And then the texture coordinate node also has a normal, so I could plug the normal into the factor instead. And so this is going to look similar, but now if I rotate the monkey head, you can see that the lighting isn't changing. Now the problem with this is that the lighting now isn't consistent. So if I rotate the monkey head over, now the brightest part is over here, but then on this object, the brightest part is over here. To fix this though, you could select the object and press Ctrl-A, and then you could apply the object's rotation. And so the object's rotation is applied, so now the lightest part is over on this side, and that's consistent with the rest of the objects. So you could use the texture coordinate if you wanted to. I'm just going to leave this here for now, but I am going to use the bevel normal instead because I like that better. Now on this bevel node, I'm going to turn the radius to zero, and also turn the samples all the way down to the minimum of two. Now if you want to change the angle of the lighting for all the objects, you can press Shift-A, go here to the search, and you can search for a mapping node. We're going to stick the mapping node right here in between the bevel and the color ramp. So the value that I like to change is the Z rotation, so I can rotate this around and now the lighting is going to change. And I could also rotate the Y and the X, but I don't really like the effect quite as much. You can play around with those if you want to, but I find that changing the Z rotation looks the best. And a value that I really like on the Z rotation is 420. So I'm going to change that Z rotation to 420. I like how that looks. So this is looking pretty cool, but it doesn't really have any shadows, and none of the shading is very soft. And so I do want to add kind of a little bit of shadows and a little bit more shading. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the ambient occlusion node. And let's stick the ambient occlusion over the mapping, and then I can Control-Shift and select the ambient occlusion to preview it. So you can see here in the cracks or where objects are really close to each other, it is very dark, but then kind of right out here where it's more flat and open, it is lighter. And you can see it also makes it appear as though there's kind of a shadow underneath some of the objects. Now if you want to make the ambient occlusion more visible, you can turn up the distance value. So I find for the shader that a distance value of 18 looks pretty good. Now if you're using Cycles Render, then you probably want to turn this down because this might make things pretty dark. But for Blender Eevee, the distance value I think looks pretty good at 18. And then if you want to make this a little bit more contrasty, you can select this color ramp and you can press Shift-D to duplicate it. We're going to drop it here after the ambient occlusion. And then I want to reset the color ramp, so I can hit the Backspace button with the color ramp selected. That's going to reset it. You can also click on the arrow here and click on Reset Color Ramp. So now the color ramp is reset, I can start to drag these two tabs together, and you can see it's going to be a bit more contrasty. And also if you're using the Cycles rendering engine, then this might be a bit too much, so you may not want to make it that contrasty. But I'm using Blender Eevee, so I'm going to make this a bit more contrasty. And now you can really see that the ambient occlusion is darker, especially right down there under the objects, they really look like they have a shadow. So I now want to combine these two different color ramps together. So to do this, I'm going to select the first color ramp, hold down the Shift key, and select the second color ramp. I can now press Ctrl-0, and that is using a feature of the Node Wrangler add-on, and it's going to add this MixRGB, and it's going to mix them both together. So the top color ramp can just go into color 1, and the bottom color ramp can go into color 2. And then you can drag the factor to blend between the two color ramps. Now I've found that a factor of 0.931 looks pretty good, I like 0.931. And so if you turn it up to 0.931, it's mostly going to use the bottom color ramp, but then it's just going to add a little bit of the top color ramp. So this does make the ambient occlusion a bit more subtle, but you can definitely see it, like right in here you can see that there's that darkening right there in the corners, and you can also drag these together if you want to be a bit more contrasty. So this shader definitely is looking better, but we still can't see the wireframes of the object. So to add a wireframe, I'm going to be adding a basic geometry node setup to these objects. So I'm going to click right up here when the crosshair appears, and then I can click and drag down, and this is going to split the window. And then right up here, I'm going to click on this to change the editor type, and I'm going to change this to the geometry node editor. And then just select an object, and I'm going to click on new here to add a new geometry nodes, and then I can rename the geometry nodes to wireframe. So when you add geometry nodes to an object, it's going to add the geometry nodes as a modifier. So let's create the wireframe geometry nodes, and then we'll add it to all of the other objects. So to start off, I'm going to press shift a, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a mesh to curve. So I'm going to drop the mesh to curve right here, and now you can see it's giving us the look of the wireframe. Now this wireframe doesn't actually have any thickness, so we want to give it some thickness and turn it back into a mesh. So I'm now going to press shift a, let's go to the search, and I'm going to now search for a curve to mesh. So I'm going to click on the curve to mesh, and drop it right here after the mesh to curve. So I need to add a curve profile to actually give it some thickness. So I'm going to press shift a, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a curve circle. So we're going to add the curve circle, just stick it right up here. Now the resolution of 32 is pretty high, so I'm going to turn this way down to like a 6. And if this resolution is still laggy for you, you could turn it down even more, but I'm going to leave it as a resolution of 6. And then let's plug the curve into the profile curve. So the curve circle is telling all of the curves what shape it's going to be. Now the radius is way too big, so I'm going to turn the radius way down. So I'm going to be using a value of 0.002, just a 0.002. And that is going to make it much smaller, but if you kind of zoom in here, you can definitely see it has some thickness there. And you can of course play around with the radius depending on the size of your objects, and how thick you want the wireframe to be. Now right now we just have a wireframe of our object, but I want to add the original geometry back up. So to do this, I'm going to press shift a, let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the join geometry, and we're going to stick the join geometry right here before the group output. So I can now take the original geometry, we're going to pull out a wire here, and stick this into the join geometry. So these nodes right up here are creating the wireframe, but then we're adding the original geometry back in, and so now we're combining them together. And if you zoom into the edges of the object, you can see we have the wireframe there. Now right now the wireframe has the same material, but instead of it having the same material, I want it to be black, or whatever custom material you want. So what I've done is I've added this cube right here, we just need some sort of object to add a new material to, so you can just press shift a and add a cube, or any other object. So just select any object, and then we want to delete any of the materials, and then we want to click on new to add a new material. So right here I can just click to rename this, and I'm going to rename this to wireframe. Now I don't want to use the principled shader, because I don't want any shading. So I'm going to select the principled shader, and I can press x to delete it, and then I'm going to press shift a. Let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the RGB node. So the RGB node is just a color value. I'm going to drop this here, and then I can plug the color into the surface. So just make sure you are in rendered mode in the 3d viewport, and I can change this to any color. So I'm going to make this fully black. With the node selected, I can press f2, and then I'm going to type in wireframe color. So there we go, wireframe color. So now I'm going to click back on this object here, and this object has the geometry nodes. Now if you zoom into the wireframe, the wireframe is still using the material of the object. So what I'm going to do in the geometry node editor is press shift a. Let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the set material node. So we are going to put the set material right after the curve to mesh. We don't want to stick it right here after the join geometry, because that's going to affect all of the geometry, but we instead just want it to affect the wireframe. So just put the set material after the curve to mesh. So we can now click right here to choose a material, and I'm going to click on the wireframe. So now just the wireframe part of the object is going to use the wireframe material, but then because we haven't set a material for the rest of the object, it's going to use the stylized shader material. So I now want to add the geometry nodes wireframe to all of the other objects. So to do this, I'm just going to press the a key to make sure all the objects are selected, and then lastly hold down the shift key and make sure you select the objects with the geometry nodes last. Now right here on the geometry nodes modifier, on the modifier properties, you can click on the drop down, and you can click on copy to selected. And so this is going to give all of the other objects the wireframe geometry nodes modifier. Alright, so this is pretty much the basic setup for the stylized shader. Now there is a few more things that I want to do. I want to set up this material so that it's a bit more customizable, and then I also want to create some different color versions like blue and red and some other cool stylized colors. So what I'm going to do here in the shader editor is press the a key to deselect all the nodes. I can now press b for the box select, and I'm just going to box select all these nodes, but I'm not going to select the material output and the viewer. I can now press ctrl g, and ctrl g is going to create a node group. Now if I press the tab key, that is going to go in and out of the group. Now if you select the node group, you can press f2 and that'll add a label, and I'm going to rename this to stylized shader. Now when we're just previewing the node group, we don't really have any way to customize the material, so I'm going to press the tab key to go into edit mode. So the first thing that I want to do is bring this group input down, and I'm just going to stick it under the bevel. I can now pull out a wire from the rotation here on the mapping, and I'm going to put that into the group input. So if I now press tab to go out of the node group, we have this rotation value, and these values are the same values as these right here. So we are basically previewing these values outside of the node group. So I can now drag this around, and that'll change the rotation of the lighting. Now if I press tab again to go into the node group, I can select the group input, and then I can press the n key to open up the side panel. And if you click right here on the group tab, you can see we have inputs and outputs. So on the input here, I can double click on this to rename it. So I'm going to rename this to light rotation, and hit enter. So now if I press tab, you can see that this says light rotation. And then I will press tab again to go back into the node group. Now the next thing that I want to do is create a bunch of different versions of the colors. So to do this, I'm going to bring the group output back, and then I'm going to press shift a. Let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's click on the color ramp and drop it here between the mix and the group output. And then if I press the n key to open up the side panel and go to the group, you can see there is the outputs. So we can actually rename the group outputs as well. So I'm going to rename this one just to gray. So now if I press the tab key to go back out of this, you can see that we have this gray one right here. So now we can create a bunch of different varieties of color with the different color ramps, and we can plug them all up to the stylized shader. So I'll press the tab key again to go into the node group. And then I'm going to click on this color ramp, and I'm going to bring it up a bit. And then I'm going to press control shift d. So control shift d is going to duplicate the node, but keep the wires plugged up. And then to preview this color ramp, I'll just control shift and select it to preview it. So I'm just going to start by dragging this out to make it a bit brighter. And then this one, I'm going to click on the color here, and I'm just going to make this kind of like a light blue. And then I'm also going to hold down the control key and click right here. That's going to add another tab, and then I can click here on the color. And this one I'm going to make kind of like a blue color, but then also make it kind of a gray color. So let's now do the next one. So with the color ramp selected, I'm going to press control shift d, and then we can control shift and select the next color ramp. So I want this one to be a stronger blue color. So I'm going to click on this color right here, and I'm going to make this a much deeper blue color and a bit brighter. And then I can drag these over, and that's going to make it a bit more contrasty. So that is looking pretty cool. And of course, we'll be able to change the rotation to kind of change how that looks later on. So let's add another one. So I'm going to press control shift d, bring it down here, and then I'll control shift and select it to preview it. And then for this one, I'm going to click on this blue color, and I'm just going to change this to like a red color. And then on this other tab right here, I'm going to click on this. I'm going to click on the RGB and then change these all to a value of one, and that way it's going to be fully white. So I'm going to press control shift d, bring this down here. And then control shift and select it to preview it. So for this next one, I'm going to drag the red out, and then I'm also going to drag the white closer, maybe bring these a bit closer. And then I'm going to bring the black back as well. And then I'm going to hold down the control key and click right here to add another one. Let's maybe bring this one over. And then for this color, I'm going to make this kind of a bluish grayish color, something like that, maybe actually a little bit more towards the purple. And then hold down the control key and click again to add another tab. I'll bring this one over. And then this one, I want to have the same red color. So I'm going to click on the color here, hover my mouse over the color and press control C to copy it. And then I can click on this tab here, hover my mouse over the color and press control V and that'll paste it. And I really like this one. I think this one looks really cool. It's very abstract and it almost reminds me of something that you would see like in a comic book. And especially with the dark wireframe, it makes it look like it was hand drawn or it was an illustration or something like that. All right, two more that I want to create. Control shift D to duplicate it, stick it here. And then I can control shift and select it to preview it. And then just press the backspace with the color ramp selected to reset the color ramp. So for this one, I'm going to make like a dark purplish pink color. So I'm going to bring this one out here, click on the color, and then I'm going to make this like a purple color and make it really dark. And then I will hold down the control key and click right there in the center to add another tab. Maybe bring this one over. And then this one is going to be mostly white and much brighter. So it's going to be kind of a bright pink. And then to make this even darker, you can drag the black tab out and it's going to be even darker. And I do think this looks really cool. I'm going to make one more and that's going to be a green one. So I'm going to press control shift D, bring this down here, and then I can control shift and select it. And then I can make these like some green colors. So maybe like a dark green. And then also let's do maybe like a light green. All right, so there we go. So I've created a bunch of different color variations. So I'm going to first press the tab key to go back to object mode. And then I can just control shift and select the stylized shader just so that we get that viewer node out of there. And then I can press tab again to go back into the node group. So you can see the first color ramp is going into this gray one. So we can now just take all the other color ramps and we can plug them into the extra circle here. So we can now take the next color ramp, plug this up here and the next one, kind of bring this down and just continue to plug all of these up to the group output. All right, so there we go. So these are all plugged up. And then to rename it, you can press the N key and that's going to open up the side panel. And then right here on the outputs, we can change the names of the outputs. So I'm going to rename this one to like gray, blue, and also red. All right, so I've now renamed all of these. And so I'm now going to press the tab key to go back out here. And so you can see now we have the stylized shader, we have the light rotation. So I can now just control shift and click on the stylized shader. And that's going to preview all the different colors that we've created. Now when it comes to the light rotation, my two favorite values that I like to use are 420 on the Z rotation. And then the other one that I like to use is 140. And why I like 140 is because it makes it really bright right here, at least on this object, it will look a little bit different depending on your object. But I really like that it's super bright over here, but then kind of appear it's more dark. And then of course, if you want to change the color of the wireframe, you can click right here on this object to preview the wireframe color. And then I can change this to any color that I want. So a dark blue might look pretty cool. So I could change this to like a dark blue. And that does look pretty cool. But I think black looks the best. So I'm going to make this fully black. So there we have it. So there is the stylized shader. So I think this is a really cool shader for showing off your wireframes, or if you're trying to create maybe like a blueprint style artwork, or if you're trying to create something that you want to look like hand drawn, or some sort of like vector art or illustration or something like that. And some of these color variations also give it a very comic book style. And if you'd like to help support me and this channel and purchase the material, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description. So I hope you found this useful, and thank you for watching."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le1NElRwLg0,Procedural Solar Panels Material 🛰️ (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural solar panel material using the Cycles Render Engine, although it is compatible with Eevee as well. The tutorial covers setting up the 3D space, including adding a plane, camera, and lighting, and then delves into creating the material using Blender's Shader Editor and NodeWrangler add-on. The instructor provides step-by-step instructions for creating the grid and blue textures, adding bump and roughness variations, and offers options for purchasing the material or supporting the channel through Gumroad, Patreon, or YouTube memberships. The tutorial concludes with a final render of the solar panel material and additional resources for learning more about procedural materials.","In this Blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural solar panels material in Blender. And I will be using Cycles Render Engine in this tutorial, but you could totally use Eevee as well. This material also works really well in the Eevee engine. So here's the material in Blender's real-time rendering engine, Blender Eevee, and it looks really nice as well. So I'm going to be using Cycles because Cycles is more realistic, but you could totally do this in Eevee as well. If you'd like to purchase this procedural material as well as help support the channel, then you can do that over on my Gumroads store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description. And if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials, you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs. So they're packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. Again, links will be in the description where you can purchase on my Gumroads store. And that is also a great way to help support this channel. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. So before we create the material, I wanted to show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So I pressed Shift-A, and I went here to Mesh, and I added a plane. And then once I added the plane, I rotated it on the x-axis by 90 degrees. And so this way the plane is pointed forwards. And then I also added a camera here, and I pointed the camera at the plane. And I kind of rotated it to the side a little bit, so it would catch a little bit of the reflections. And then for the lighting, I added in this area light right here. So I just set this to a square, and I made it really big and bright. I set the power to 3000, and then I just left this as a bright white color. And this is going to help to give some reflections to those solar panels. And then to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections, right over here on the world properties, I added in this Photo Studio Broadway Hall 1K HDR. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, and I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download it. So I downloaded the 1K HDR version of this HDRI. And when you add a new world, you can click here on the yellow dot next to the color. And then you can go right here to Environment Texture, just choose the Environment Texture. And then you can click on Open to open up the HDRI. And then in the rendered view, you can see that the background is transparent. And so if you want the background to be transparent, then you can click right over here to the Render Properties, and then you can open up the Film tab right here. And then you can just click on the Transparent button, and that way you can't see the HDRI in the background. And then to make the colors and lighting look a little bit nicer, I set the view transform to Filmic and the look here to a very high contrast. And this is right here in the Color Management settings in the Render Properties. So I have the 3D space right here, and I'm in the rendered view. And then I also have the Shader Editor right here. And then I will also be using the NodeWrangler add-on in this tutorial. So if you don't have the NodeWrangler enabled, you can just click right up here on Edit and go to the Preferences, and then click over there on the Add-ons tab. And up there on the search, you can search for NodeWrangler and just checkmark the NodeWrangler add-on. So the add-on is built into Blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So I'm just going to select this object here, and I'm going to click on New to create a new material. And I can also rename the material. Procedural Solar Panels. So to start off, I'm going to create kind of that grid texture with those diamond shapes. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture. And let's stick the Voronoi right there. And then we turned on the NodeWrangler add-on. So you can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and then select different nodes. And that is going to add the Viewer node, and it's going to preview the node on the object. And then also with the Voronoi texture selected, I'm going to press Ctrl-T. And this is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And this is using another feature from the NodeWrangler add-on. Now, I want to use the object coordinates. So let's plug the object into the vector of this mapping node. And then we can use the mapping node later on to scale the entire material. So I will leave the mapping node here. And the vector from the mapping node is going to go into the vector of the Voronoi. Now, right here on this bottom dropdown, I'm going to click on this. And I'm going to change this to the Chebyshev. So now that I've changed it to the Chebyshev, you can see we have all these little squares here. Now, the squares are very random, and I don't want them to be random. I want them to be straight. So let's take the randomness value right here on the Voronoi texture, and let's turn this to 0. So now we have this really nice pattern here with all these squares. And then right here on the Voronoi scale, I'm just going to turn it to a value of 2. Now, I want to make the squares more contrasty because right now they almost look like pyramids or something. But I want to make them more sharp so that there are these black squares with white lines. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the ColorRamp node. We're going to stick the ColorRamp node right here after the Voronoi texture. So now I can drag these tabs together. And as I drag them closer and closer, it's going to make it more contrasty. And I actually want to flip these values. So I'm going to drag the white tab over here and then the black tab over here. So we have white squares with the black lines. And then I want it to be very contrasty and pretty small as well. So I'm going to drag these back here, and I'm going to bring them very close to each other. So something like that is pretty good. So they're about in the center, and the white and the black tabs are very close to each other. So now you can see we have this grid texture. So now I also want to add the diamond shape because there's kind of a diamond shape where all the lines meet. So let's do that. So I can actually use the same Voronoi texture and the ColorRamp. So I'm going to select the Voronoi texture, hold down the Shift key, and select the ColorRamp. I now want to duplicate these. So normally you can press Shift-D to duplicate, but I'm going to press Control-Z to undo that. I'm going to instead press Control-Shift-D. And because I pressed Control-Shift-D, it's going to duplicate the nodes but keep the wires plugged up. So now the mapping is plugged up to this Voronoi texture. And then I can Control-Shift and select the ColorRamp to preview it. Now on this bottom Voronoi, I'm going to click on the Chebyshev, and I'm going to instead change this to the Manhattan. So now you can see we have the diamond shape. Now the diamonds are kind of going through each other, so I want to drag around the ColorRamp to change the shape of that. And I want to make them smaller. And I also want to flip the colors so that the black is on this side, so on the left side of the ColorRamp. And then I'm going to drag this over and also drag the white tab over so that we have these little diamond shapes. And make sure they are pretty close so there isn't very much blending. There should just be a little bit of a color fade there from black to white, but it should be pretty sharp. So something like that is great. So I can Control-Shift and select both of these, and I want to combine both of them together because we have the grid and the diamond. So I'm going to select the first ColorRamp, hold down the Shift key, and select the second ColorRamp. I can now press Control-0, so that is using the feature of the Node Wrangler. And it's going to add this MixRGB node, and I can click on the arrow to open this up. And let's actually box select all these nodes and kind of move them back here so we have a bit more space. So we can use the MixRGB to mix colors together. So I want the top ColorRamp to go into Color 1, and the bottom ColorRamp to go into Color 2. Now I just want to add the dark values. Right now we have this Factor value, but the Factor value is just evenly blending between both of them. But I just want to add the black values. So I can click on the Mix here, and I can change this to Darken, and then this way it's just going to add the dark values. So then I can turn the Factor all the way up to 1, and now it's just adding all those black areas. Now there is a problem here. I want the diamonds right over here where those lines meet, and I don't really want it in the center. So right back over here, we can change the mapping, and we can move the texture over so it's in the center there. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go here to the Search, and I'm going to search for the VectorMath node. And let's drop the VectorMath node right here, and then I can kind of bring these back, bring the ColorRamp back, and kind of put the textures over each other. And make sure you put the VectorMath node between the mapping and the bottom Voronoi, because the bottom Voronoi texture is the diamond one. So these values are representing the X, Y, and Z axis, so I can drag these values, and you can see that it's going to move the texture around. So I'm going to select the top value, and then drag down once, and then let go. And this way we can change the X and Y value at the same time. And I'm going to type in .75, so just .75, and so this way the VectorMath node is shifting the texture over a little bit on the X and the Y axis. And so now the diamond shapes are right there in the center where the grid meets. Now I'm going to zoom out here, and I want to put all of these nodes together in a frame, just to organize them very well. So I'm going to press B for the box select, I'm going to drag my mouse over all these nodes here, and then I can press Ctrl-J. So Ctrl-J is going to add this frame, and I can drag the frame around, and it's just a nice way to organize the nodes. And then with the frame selected, I can press F2, and this is going to add a label, and I can just rename this to GridTexture, and then hit Enter. Alright, so that is the grid texture, but I also want to create the blue texture, so let's do that. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search here, and I'm going to search for another Voronoi texture, let's stick it up here. And then I want the mapping node to be able to scale the entire material, so I want every texture to be plugged up to it. And I also want all of the textures to use the object coordinates. So let's pull out a wire from the vector here on the mapping, and we're going to stick that into the vector of the Voronoi. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it, and I actually want to Ctrl-Shift and select it twice, so that we can preview the color value. Now on the scale here, I'm going to change the scale to 130. So now it's really small, and if you zoom in there, you can see we have all these little chunks of color. Now I want to make these colors blue, so they look like solar panels. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go here to the search, and I can search for the ColorRamp node, and then we're going to stick the ColorRamp node right in here after the Voronoi texture. And make sure the color from the Voronoi is going into the ColorRamp. So I can now change the colors of the ColorRamp, and that'll change the colors of the Voronoi texture. So I'm going to click on the black tab, and I'm going to click on the color, and I'm going to make this a dark blue color. And if you'd like to use the exact same color that I'm using, then you can click right over here on the hex value, and you can punch in a hex value of 002E8D. So that is the color that I'll be using. And then I'm going to click on the white tab, and this color is going to be a similar color, so it's going to be kind of a dark blue, but it's going to be a little bit brighter and a little bit less saturated. And the exact color that I'll be using for this lighter blue, if you go over here to the hex value, you can punch in 004B9E. So that is the exact color that I'll be using. So we now have a nice texture there for the solar panels. Now I also want to add a little bit of variation, so I'm going to have some parts be a little bit darker and some parts be a little bit lighter. And this will also help the solar panels to look a little bit more worn and old, and maybe a little bit dirty as well. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the noise texture. Let's click on this noise texture, and I'm going to drop it right here above the Voronoi. And then I also want to use the object coordinates. So right here, I can actually hold down the Shift key, and I can right-click and then drag over the wire and let go. And this is going to add a reroute, and I can just drag the reroute up here, and then I can pull out a wire and stick it into the noise texture. So this is basically just splitting up the wire, but it really is all coming from the mapping. So using reroutes is just a nice way to organize the nodes and make it look nicer. And then let's also organize this very well. So I'm going to press B for the box select. I'm just going to box select all these nodes here, and then to add a frame, I can press Ctrl-J. Ctrl-J is going to add a frame, and then if I select the frame, I can press F2 to rename the frame. And I can just rename this to, like, Blue Texture. All right, there we go, Blue Texture. So now I'm going to Ctrl-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And let's change some of the values. So I do want it to be very detailed, so let's turn the detail all the way to the max, which is 15. And then also the scale here, I'm going to turn this down to, like, a 2, so that those blobs of color are a little bit bigger. So I now want to combine the noise texture and the color ramp. So you can just select the noise texture, hold down the Shift key, and select the color ramp. And then I can press Ctrl-0, and again, that's using the Node Wrangler feature, and it's going to add this MixRGB. So I can click on the MixRGB, and I'm going to drag it inside this frame here with the blue texture, and just drag it over there. Now, I actually want the noise texture to be going into the factor. And then I want this bottom color ramp here to be going into color 1. Now, I just want to add the dark values, because I just want to add a little bit of dark noise over this color ramp. So I'm going to click on the Mix here, and I'm going to change this to Darken. And then if I click right here on color 2, I can change this color. And you can see if I turn it up to white, you can't see any of the noise texture. But then as I turn color 2 down, it's going to reveal more and more of the noise texture. And then I'm also going to make this a very dark blue. So I'm going to bring this over to the blue values. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using for color 2, you can go to the hex value, and you can punch in 13192b. So now you can see that there's some little dark areas here and there around the texture. Now, I do want to make this a little bit more contrasty, so I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the Search, and I can search for a color ramp, and we can stick the color ramp right here after the noise texture. So now if I take the color ramp colors, if I drag them together, it's going to be more contrasty. So I'm just going to drag this over a little bit, and then I'll also drag the white tab over a little bit. So now those little dark patches are a little bit more visible and easier to see. Now, I also want to add that really small grid texture all along the material. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the Search, and I'm going to search for the brick texture. Let's click on the brick texture, and I want to stick the brick texture right here inside the blue texture frame, and then I can also drag this up. And then just like all the other textures, I want the mapping node to be plugged into the texture, so I can just drag a wire out of the reroute and stick that into the vector of the brick texture. And then I can Control-Shift and select the brick texture to preview it. So right now it looks like bricks, but I want this to look like a very small grid, so let's take color 1, we're going to make that fully black, and also color 2, we're going to make this fully black as well. And then on this mortar here, I can make this fully white. So this way, all of the bricks are black, and we just have that white grid there. Now it doesn't really look like a grid, so let's take the offset, and we're going to turn that to 0. So now that the offset is turned to 0, it looks just like a grid. And then to change the size of the grid, we can change the mortar size. So I'm going to change the mortar size to a 0.015, so a 0.015, and now the white lines are a bit smaller. And then I also want to make the edges a little bit more smooth, so on the mortar smooth value, I can change this to a 0.49. So just a 0.49, and now the edges are just a little bit more smooth. And then also right here on the brick width, let's change this to a 0.625, so a 0.625, and that way there will always be the same amount of vertical lines. And then on the row height here, I will just change this to a 0.2. Alright, so I now want to combine this darken with the brick texture. So I'm going to select the brick texture, hold down the Shift key and select the darken, and then I can press Ctrl 0, and again, that's going to add this mix RGB, and I can click on this arrow to open it up. And let's stick it right here inside this frame, and I can just bring it over. And then this is a little bit large, so I'm going to actually put the brick texture up here in between the darken and the mix, so this way it's just a little bit smaller. So I'm going to have the darken here, then I'll just bring the brick texture up here, and then the mix can be in front of the darken. And then I can just kind of drag this over and stick it down here. And maybe also bring these back a bit, just to organize my nodes a little bit better. Alright, so I'm now going to use this mix to combine the darken and the brick texture together. Now I just want to add the light values, so on the mix here I can click on this, and I'm going to change this to lighten. And then I want to take the brick texture color, and I don't want it to be going into color 2, I want the color instead to be going into the factor. And then I want the color from the darken node to be going into color 1. So now I can click on color 2, and I can change this brightness value, and if I turn color 2 all the way to 0, you can't see the brick texture at all. But then as I turn this up lighter and lighter, it's just going to add the light values, and so it's going to add more and more of the brick texture. But I don't want to make it super bright, because it is very white, I just want to make it kind of a gray color. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using for color 2, you can use a hex value of 828282. So that's the gray color that I'll be using for the grid texture there. Alright, so we now have the blue texture and the grid texture, and I want to combine these together. So I'm going to drag the principled shader over here, maybe even box select these nodes and bring them up a bit so we have a bit more space. So I'm now going to select the darken from the grid texture, and I can hold down the shift key, and I'm going to select the lighten from the blue texture. And then once again, I can press Ctrl-0, and that's going to add this MixRGB. I can bring it over here and open up the MixRGB. And then I want to take this darken here from the grid texture, and I want to put that into the factor. And then I want the lighten from the blue texture to be going into color 2. So because we are using this darken here as the factor in the mix, the factor is going to tell it where the texture is going to be color 1, and where the texture is going to be color 2. And this darken here is just black and white values. So you can see that color 2 is the lighten here, so it is the blue texture. So then color 1 is going to be the grid texture. So I can click on color 1, and I can change this, and you can see it's going to change the color of the large grid. Now this large grid is going to be metal, so I want to click on color 1, and I'm just going to make this kind of a gray color. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using for the metal grid, then here on color 1, you can go to the hex, and you can punch in 8C, 8C, 8C. So this is the finished color texture. So I can take the color here from the mix, and I can stick that into the base color. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now I want to make this look like metal, so let's take the metallic value on the principled shader, and we're going to turn the metallic all the way to 1. So now it actually looks like a metallic material. Now if I look at the side of the solar panels, you can see it's very, very smooth, and I do want it to look a little bit bumpy. So I'm going to take this grid texture, and I'm going to put it into the normal to give it some bump. So let's take the color here from the darken. I'm going to stick that into the normal of the principled shader. Now you can see there's some weird shading issues. The whole texture looks really dark, and that is because this is color data, so it's a yellow dot, but then this right here is normal data, and it's a purple dot. So we can't mix these two together. We need a node in here to convert the color data into normal data. So let's press Shift-A. I'm going to go here to the search, and I'm going to search for a bump node, and the bump node will convert the color data to normal data. So we're going to stick this right in here between the darken and the normal. And then to actually convert it to normal data, we want to put this into the height value of the bump. So now if you kind of look here on the side and zoom up close, it actually looks like those metal pieces are popping out of the mesh a bit. And then I also want to click on the invert button, and that way instead of it looking like it's going in, it looks like it's popping out. Now you can see that the other smaller grid is perfectly flat, and that's because we haven't added it into the bump. So I actually want to add it into the bump as well. So to do this, let's press Shift-A. I'm going to go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the MixRGB, and I'm just going to stick the MixRGB right here between the darken and the bump. So the brick texture is what's creating the smaller grid. So I can take the color from the brick texture, and I'm going to bring the wire down here, and I'm going to stick it into the factor of this mix here, which is right before the bump. And then again, I just want to add the dark values. So on the mix here, I can click on this, and I'm just going to change this to darken. And then the darken from the grid texture is going to go into color 1. So I can now click on color 2, and I'm going to make this fully dark. So now you can see that the smaller grid also looks like it's popping out of the mesh. And if I Control-Shift and select the darken, you can see that's what we've created. So basically, we have joined the brick texture and the grid texture together with this darken. And then that is going to go into the bump node. So if I Control-Shift and select the bump node, you can see what we've created. So this is the normal map. So you can see what is popping out of the mesh. So I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader. And then also, if you want to organize the nodes very well, you can select the darken, hold down the Shift key, and select the bump. And then you can press Control-J. Control-J is going to add another frame. And then if you select the frame, you can press F2 to rename the frame. And I'm going to rename it to bump. So now the label says bump. So this is looking pretty cool, and we are almost done with this material. But I do want to have some variation in the roughness. So right here, there's a roughness value on the principled shader. And if I turn this way down, it's going to be very shiny and reflective, kind of like a mirror. And so I do want it to be more reflective, but I want some parts to be a little bit more shiny and other parts to be a little bit more rough. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for a noise texture. And we're going to bring the noise texture way down here underneath the grid texture. And then just like all the other textures, I want the mapping node to be plugged into it. So let's pull out a wire from the vector, and I'm going to stick this into the vector of the noise texture. And then I can Control-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So now let's change some of the values. So I'm going to turn the scale here to like A6. And then I want this to be very detailed, so let's turn the detail all the way to the max, which is 15. And then I do want to add a little bit more roughness. So let's turn the roughness value to a 0.55. So I can now pull out a wire from the noise texture factor, and I'm going to stick this into the roughness value of the principled shader. So instead of using a single value, the noise texture is going to control the roughness of the material. So I can Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview that. And I'm going to bring the noise texture over so it's a little bit closer. And then you can see this wire is overlapping. So if you want to, you can hold down the Shift key, and you can right-click and drag, and then let go. That's going to add a reroute, and I can just bring the reroute over. All right, now I want more control over this, because right now that's actually looking pretty rough, and I do want it to be more shiny. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go here to the search. And I'm going to search for a color ramp and just click on the color ramp. And I'm going to stick the color ramp right here after the noise texture. So I can now use the color ramp to change the colors, and that'll change how shiny the material is. So I first want it to be a bit more contrasty, so I'm going to drag the black tab over a bit. And you can see that now some parts are more shiny. Now, if I make the values lighter, the material is going to be more rough. So I can click on the black tab here, and I can turn this up and make it more of a gray color. And you can see it's going to make the material more rough. And if you want to use the exact same value that I'm using right here on this color ramp color, I'm going to be using a hex value of 3F 3F 3F. And then I do want to make the white tab a little bit darker so that it's a bit more shiny all over the place. So I'm going to click on the white tab right here, and I can make this a little bit darker. And the hex value that I'm going to be using is F4 F4 F4. So now the solar panels are much more reflective, and there's also a lot of variation. So you can see there's some little parts here and there where it's more rough, and then other parts where it's more shiny. And then again, if you want to keep your nodes very organized, you can press B for the box select. Just box select all these nodes here, so the color ramp, the noise texture, and the reroute. And then you can press Ctrl J, and that is going to add this frame here. I'll just bring the frame down, and then I can press F2 to rename this. And I'm just going to rename this to roughness because this is controlling the roughness. So that is it. That is the procedural solar panel material. Now there is one more thing that I want to show you. I want to show you how you can change the size of the entire material. So the mapping node is plugged into all the textures. So if I change the scale of the mapping node, that's going to change the scale of the entire material. Now I want to change all the scale values at once. So I could click and then drag down and then drag back and forth, and that's going to change the scale values all at once. But I can also press Shift A. I can go here to the search, and I can search for the value node. Let's drop the value node here, and then I can plug the value node into the scale. So this way, this one single value will control all of the X, Y, and Z scale. So I'm just going to turn this to 1. I think 1 looks pretty good for this object. But of course, depending on the size of your object and the size of the solar panel, you can just drag the value node around, and that's going to change the size of the material. And there is the final render. So thank you so much for watching this tutorial, and I hope you enjoyed the video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbNPddQbaDo,Procedural Sci-Fi Panels Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural sci-fi metal panels material. By adjusting values and colors, users can achieve diverse results, such as altering panel scale or placement. The tutorial covers using node editor displacements for 3D effects and lighting techniques for realistic reflections. Additionally, the creator promotes their procedural material available for purchase on Gumroad, along with a new Blender procedural material pack. They also guide viewers on customizing the material further by changing scale, randomizing panels, and tweaking colors. The video concludes with an invitation to support the creator through purchasing materials or joining their YouTube membership.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural sci-fi metal panels material in Blender. And just by changing some of the values and some of the colors of this procedural material, you can get a bunch of different results like all of these results that I have up here. So I've changed some of the colors and changed some of the values to kind of change the scale or to change the placement of the sci-fi panels. And as you can see, you can get a bunch of different really cool results. So I'll show you some really cool values you can play around with at the end of the video to get a bunch of different variations of this material. If you'd like to help support me and this channel, you can purchase this procedural material on my Gumroad store and all my patrons over on my Patreon page also get access to the procedural material. And I also wanted to let you all know that I just recently released Blender procedural material pack number nine. So if you've been watching my videos for a while, then you know that I create a lot of procedural material tutorials. And so every time I create another 10 procedural materials, I compile them together into a Blender procedural material pack. So if you'd like to purchase the procedural material packs, I'll have a link in the description where you can purchase on my Gumroad store. And that is also a great way to help support me and this channel. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. So before we create the procedural material, I wanted to show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So to preview the procedural material, I added a cube and a plane. And then I also subdivided the plane in the cube a lot. And that's because I'm going to be using the displacements in the node editor to actually displace the mesh so that some of the panels are higher up and then other panels are lower down. And then I also added a camera and pointed the camera at the objects. And then I also added in all these area lights pointed in different directions. And I did this to give the material some cool lighting and reflections and highlights. And all of these area lights also are using a very slight blue color to kind of give it a cool sci-fi lighting. And then to help to get very realistic lighting and reflections, I added this Cara interior. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. So I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download it. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. So you can just add a new world. And then you can click right here on the yellow dot next to the color. And you can choose environment texture. And then you can click on the open button and open up the HDRI. And then I wanted the background to be transparent. So if you go right over here to the render properties, you can open up the film tab and you can just check mark the transparent button. So you can't see the HDRI. And then also to make the lighting and colors look a bit nicer, you can go down here to the color management. And on the view transform, you can set this to filmic. And then for the look here, you can just use like medium high contrast. Now I am going to be using the displacements in the node editor so that some of the panels are higher up and other panels are lower down. So if you want to use the displacements, you are going to need to use the cycles rendering engine. And then I will also be using the adaptive subdivision. So if you want to use the adaptive subdivision right here on the feature set, you can just set this to experimental. And then to add the adaptive subdivision, you can just select the object that you want to add the subdivision to. And then you can go right over here to the modifier properties and you can click on add modifier and you can add the subdivision surface modifier. And then if you turned on the experimental mode, you'll see this adaptive subdivision and you can just check mark this to turn it on. And then because I already subdivided this object a lot, it is already pretty detailed, so I don't need that much detail. So I'm just going to turn the dicing scale to like a 10. And so what the adaptive subdivision is going to do is it's going to subdivide the object where it's closer up to the camera and where you can see it in more detail. But then where it's farther away, there will be less detail. And so this will help with the performance and it'll also make the displacements higher quality. Or if you want to, you can just subdivide the mesh a lot so it has lots of geometry to displace. Now there is one more displacement setting that we need to turn on and that is within the material. So just select the object and then I'm in the shading tab right here and I have the 3D space right here and I'm in the rendered view and then I have the shader editor right over here. So I'm just going to click on new to add a new material and I can also rename the material. And then I'm going to click right down here to go to the material properties and we're going to open up the settings tab right here. And then right here under surface we need to click on the bump only and we need to change this to displacement and bump. And so this is going to tell the material that it can actually use the displacements. And then also I want to add this material to this object here. So I'm going to click and drag and I'm going to drop this material onto the object. Or you can select the object and then just select the material in the drop down. And then I'm also going to be using the node wrangler add-on in this tutorial. So if you don't have the node wrangler add-on enabled you can just click right here and edit and go right here to the preferences. And then over there on the add-ons tab you can search for node wrangler and just check mark the node wrangler add-on and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off with this material I'm going to press shift a. Let's go here to the search and I'm going to start off by searching for a brick texture. Let's click on the brick texture and I can just drop it here. And then to preview the brick texture I'm going to control shift and select the brick texture and that is going to add the viewer node and that is using the node wrangler add-on feature. And so it's going to add the viewer node and then we can actually preview what the node looks like on the object. And then with the brick texture selected I'm also going to press ctrl t and that is going to add this texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And I want to use the object coordinates because the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the objects more evenly. So let's take the object I'm going to pull out a wire and I'm going to stick this into the vector of the mapping and the mapping node we can use this later to actually scale the entire texture. So if you want to make it bigger or smaller you can do that with the mapping and I'll show you how to do that later. So we are going to leave the mapping here for now and the vector can just go into the vector of the brick texture. Now you can see there is a scale value on the brick texture but instead of just using a scale value I'm going to plug a different texture into the scale value. So let's press shift a. I'm going to go here to the search and I'm going to search for the voronoi texture and we're just going to drop this right down here behind the brick texture. And then I can ctrl shift and select it to preview it and I actually want to ctrl shift and select it again and that way we can preview the color instead. And then I want to use the object coordinates so let's take the vector and we're going to put that into the vector of the voronoi. Now let's click on this 3d right here and I'm going to instead change this to 4d and then I will leave the middle option right here to f1. And then right here on this bottom drop down I'm going to click on this and I'm going to change this to the chebyshev. So now if you zoom in here you can see we have these little cubes but these little cubes have some little bevels on the side and that looks pretty sci-fi. Now you can change this randomness value right here but if you turn the randomness all the way to zero it's just going to be kind of a checker texture so I do want to keep the randomness up all the way to one so it looks more sci-fi and there's more bevels. And then on the w value here I'm just going to turn that to like a value of one. So I'm now going to take this color here from the voronoi and I'm going to put that into the scale so we are using the voronoi texture as the value in the scale instead of using a single scale value. So I can ctrl shift and select the brick texture and you can see what that's doing. And so you can see it's basically distorting the texture and it's making it all random and sci-fi so we have these cool lines kind of coming up and down and we also have these little chunks here and some chunks kind of have bevels and then others are just squares. Now if I click right here I can drag this out to make the brick texture a little bit bigger so I can read these values. So on the mortar smooth I'm going to change this to a 0.56. I think that looks a bit better and by turning up the mortar smooth you can see that it's going to smooth this out so it's not so sharp. Some places are kind of sharp and I do want that in some areas but then other areas are going to be more smooth and this way there's going to be more of a transition when we put this into the displacements. And then all these other settings here I can just leave at the defaults. So I can now take this color here and I'm going to plug this into the base color of the principled shader and then I can ctrl shift and select the shader to preview it. Now I do want to change the colors here on the brick texture so let's do that. So I'm going to first click on color 1 and I'm going to make this fully white and then I'm going to click on color 2 and I want to make this just a little bit darker and I'm actually going to ctrl shift and select the brick texture to preview it. So I'll just make color 2 a little bit darker and if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using right here on color 2 you can go over to the hex value and you can punch in 424242. And then for this mortar color I'm going to click on this and I'm going to make this a little bit brighter so it's just going to be a very dark gray. And again if you want to use the same exact color you can click over here on the hex and you can punch in 1d 1d 1d. So now let's ctrl shift and select the principled shader again. Now it isn't really looking like metal and that's because we haven't turned up the metallic value. So on the principled shader we can turn the metallic value all the way to 1 and so now it actually looks like a metallic material and it is very shiny. Now I don't want the entire thing to be metallic I want most of it to be metallic so kind of right here where these big panels are I want that to be metal but then kind of these darker areas I don't really want that to be metal. So I can actually pull out a wire from the color and I'm going to stick this in to the metallic value and then I want to be able to control this. So to control this I'm going to press shift a let's go here to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp and we're going to click on the color ramp and let's stick it here between the brick texture and the metallic. And then just to preview this I'm going to ctrl shift and select the color ramp to preview it. So if I drag these values around that's going to make it more contrasty so we can make things more dark or we can make things more light. Now I don't want to have a blending between black and white so I'm going to click on the linear right here and I'm going to change this to consistent. So if the color is white it's going to be fully metallic and if the color is black it's not going to be metallic. So I can click on this white tab and I can drag this over and so depending on how much of the material you want to be metal you can drag this closer and closer. So I want the material to mostly be metallic so I'm going to drag this over until most of it is white so something like that but then some parts are black so again the black parts are not going to be metal. So I can now ctrl shift and select the principled shader and you can see now those big metal panels definitely look metallic they're very shiny. We could even turn the roughness down just to see that a bit better so they're more shiny but then kind of these darker areas in here like this line here that is not metal. Now I do want to play around with this roughness because I don't want to use a static value I don't want the entire thing to be the same roughness value. I want some parts to be a little bit more rough and other parts to be a little bit more shiny. So to do this I'm going to add a noise texture and we're going to put the noise texture into the roughness so some parts are a little bit more rough and other parts are a bit more shiny. So I'm going to zoom out here and I'm going to press shift a let's go here to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's click on this noise texture and I'm going to drop it right here underneath the brick texture and then let's ctrl shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Now I also want to use the object coordinates and I also want everything to be plugged up to the mapping so that when we change the mapping scale that's going to change all the textures. So let's take the vector here from the mapping and I'm going to stick that into the vector the noise texture. Now you can see the wire is overlapping so if you don't want there to be an overlap you can hold down the shift key and then you can right click and drag over this wire and let go and this is going to add a reroute and then you can just drag the reroute around and I'm just going to bring this down here maybe bring these over so that way the wire goes down and then over this isn't going to actually change the procedural material but it is just helpful for organizing your nodes better. So now let's change the noise texture settings so I'm going to turn the detail all the way to the max which is 15 and then I do want to add a little bit more roughness to give more detail so on this roughness value right here I'm going to just change this to a 0.55 so now we have a lot of detail there in the noise texture. So now I'm going to take the factor value and we're going to stick that into the roughness value here the principled shader and then I can ctrl shift and select the principled shader let's also bring this down a bit now I want to have more control over this so again let's press shift a I'm going to go here to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp node and we're going to stick the color ramp node here between the noise texture and the principled shader so just stick it right there now if I make the values darker they're going to be more shiny but if the values are lighter they're going to be more rough so if I want it to be more shiny I can just click on the white tab here and click on the color and I can make this darker and you can see it's going to be more reflective and more shiny and if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using right over here on the hex you can type in b7 b7 b7 so now if I zoom in here if I kind of zoom over here to this reflection you can see some parts are a bit more shiny whereas other parts are a bit more rough and that also gives it a really nice metal texture because it just looks a little bit scratched up now I also want to put some values into the normal here to give it some bump so let's first take the brick texture color I'm going to pull out a wire and let's stick that into the normal here of the principled shader now you can see the texture looks really dark and there's some weird shading issues and that is because this is color data but then this right here is normal data this is a yellow dot and then this is a purple dot so we need a node in here to convert the color data into normal data that the principled shader can use so to do this I'm going to press shift a let's go here to the search and I'm going to search for the bump node let's click on the bump node and I'm going to drop this in here in between the wire going from the brick texture into the normal now to actually convert this to normal data we need to take the normal right here and we're going to put this into the height value so now it actually looks like the sci-fi panels are being popped out and it is a little bit strong right now so I'm going to take the strength value and I'm just going to turn this down to like a 0.5 so it is just half as strong but now if you look here on the side of the panels there's that little reflection there and it kind of looks like the panels are bumping out now we also are going to use the displacements to actually pop the mesh out but this bump node will also help to make it look like the panels are popping out now the metal plating is very smooth and so I want to put the noise texture into the bump to just give it a little bit of noisy bump all over the material so I'm going to click on the bump node and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate and we're going to drop this right here after the first bump so this brick texture is going into the height value of the first bump and then the normal can go through the normal because this has already been converted to normal data so we now have an extra height value that we can add data into so I'm going to take the factor from the noise texture and let's stick that into the height value of the bump so now the metal looks like it's been hit with a hammer it looks all dinged up and banged up and that is way too strong so on the strength value right here I'm going to turn this to a very small number of 0.015 so just 0.015 so that is very subtle it is going to be very subtle but if you zoom in there you can just see that there's a little bit of noise all over the metal and that will make it look more realistic all right so we are almost done with this procedural material but I still want to add the displacements to actually make the sci-fi panels popping out and if you don't want to use the displacements you could totally skip that if you like it how it is but I am going to be adding the displacements and then after I add the displacements I will also go over some values that you can change to make the material look different so to add the displacements I'm going to pull out a wire here from this color from the brick texture and I'm going to stick this into the displacement of the material output now you can see something is definitely happening but it's really weird and it's kind of popping out to one side and that is because this is displacement data it is a purple dot here but then this is color data it's a yellow dot so we need to convert the color data to displacement data so to do this let's press shift a I'm going to go here to the search and I'm going to search for the displacement node and we're going to stick the displacement node here in this wire and then I can drag it down and stick it underneath the principled shader and also the wire is overlapping so if you want to you can hold down the shift key you can right click and drag over the wire and let go that is going to add the reroute and then I can just like drop the reroute down here and that way the wire isn't overlapping so it still isn't really working properly and that is because we need to actually plug this into the height value so when I put it into the height value now you can see it's popping out from all sides now this is way too strong so let's make this much less strong so I'm going to turn the scale value here on the displacement to like a 0.05 just a 0.05 and that is a much better scale so now if I zoom in here you can see the lighter parts are popping out but then the darker parts are going back in so now these metal panels here are actually being displaced and they're popping out of the mesh so that is it that is the procedural material now there is a few more things that I want to go over if you want to customize this more so if you want to change the scale of the entire material then you can change the scale right here on the mapping so you can click and then drag down and then drag back and forth and that is going to change all the scale values at once but instead of doing that I'm going to press shift a let's go here to the search and I'm going to search for a value node and let's stick the value node right here underneath the texture coordinate and I can plug the value node into the scale so this way the value node is going to control all of the scale values at once so now I can just play around with the scale value and that's going to change the scale of the entire material so I like a value of 0.7 I think 0.7 looks pretty good but you could make this bigger or smaller depending on what you're creating and then if you want to randomize the sci-fi panels you can change the w value on the voronoi texture so you can just drag this back and forth and it's just going to randomize those panels and put them in different areas and kind of change it up so this is a really great way to get variation in the sci-fi panels and then another really cool thing you could do is you could change the colors so I'm going to click here on color one and I could maybe make this like a blue color that's pretty cool now you can see when I change this when I change the color it is actually changing the displacement and that is because when you change the color the color is going into the displacement and so where the values are white it's going to be popping out and then where the values are dark it's going to be going back in and so that is why the panel's depth is kind of changing a little bit when I change the color here now if you do want to change the color of the metal but you don't want it to affect the displacement you could press shift a you can go right here to the search and you can just search for a color ramp and then you can just stick the color ramp right in here between the color and the base color so then you can change the color ramp colors and that is not going to affect the displacement because this color here is going into the displacement so I could control shift and select this color ramp to preview it and then I could just like hold down the control key and click right there to add another tab like a gray tab and then this white tab right here I can click on the color and I could maybe make this like a blue color and then also I could maybe add another tab right here and then this one I could maybe make another blue color and I can play around with the placement of these colors and that is actually a really cool sci-fi texture I really like the blue sci-fi metal I could also maybe bring this one out and make this like a red color or maybe an orange color so we have some blue and some orange and you can see that some of the colors are blending so there's like this pink here so you could also click on the linear and you could just change this to like constant and now each color is going to be constant so that actually looks pretty cool as well I do like that as well so there's so many ways that you can change the colors by using this color ramp right here or using these values I could also flip this so that this is gray and then have some other blue colors over here or I could maybe make this like a red color or an orange color I'm just going to click on this color ramp and press x to delete it and I can put the color back into the base color but that's how you can change the colors without changing the displacement but you could make this maybe like some blue sci-fi panels that's pretty cool or maybe even like orange I do like the red I think that looks pretty cool or I could maybe change this one back to white and on the mortar here I could maybe change this color so I could make me make this a bit brighter and then make it like a blue color so now there's like gray panels and then there's like some dark blue in there or maybe I could make this like a dark red or even like a light red and then you can also change all of these values here on the voronoi and the brick texture so you could change this mortar size and that's going to make it look different so that's pretty cool you might want to change the colors with that one but that's pretty cool if you change the mortar size now you could also change the mortar smooth and that's going to change the smoothness of where those dark areas are you could also change the bias right here so I could turn this way down and that looks quite different I actually really like how that looks right over here we have these little cool sci-fi paneling here and there but most of it is dark so that's pretty cool you could also change the brick width and the brick height and that is going to make it look different as well so actually turning up the row height looks pretty cool I like those big smooth areas so there's so many combinations you could play around with to get some really cool sci-fi panels you could also change the scale here on the voronoi texture if you want to have a bunch of little dark squares and I actually really like that as well I think that looks really cool so you have like this kind of trench thing and then you have all these little dark squares so by playing around with all of these scale values and color values you can make some really cool sci-fi panels and here is the final render and then also up on the screen I'll throw up some other combinations that I created just to show you all the different variations of sci-fi panels that you can create with this material so thank you so much for watching this tutorial I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you found it helpful

The material is available for purchase on their Gumroad store, and patrons on Patreon have access to it as well. The tutorial covers setting up a 3D space with an Icosphere, camera, and lighting, and explains using the Cycles rendering engine with Adaptive Subdivision for displacement effects. The creator also encourages supporting their work through various platforms, including Blender procedural material packs, YouTube memberships, and super thanks. Links to relevant resources and project files are provided in the video description.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural rock cave wall material in Blender. This procedural material can be purchased on my Gumroad store, and all of my patrons over on my Patreon page also get access to the procedural material. So I will have the links in the description if you'd like to purchase the project files, and that's a great way to help support me and this channel. And another great way to help support this channel is by checking out my Blender procedural material packs. So I create many procedural materials using Blender's procedural nodes, and so every time I create another 10 procedural materials, I compile them together into a Blender procedural material pack. So again, I'll have the links in the description if you'd like to check out those material packs, and that's a great way to help support this channel. And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube. And some great ways to help support me here on YouTube is by checking out the YouTube memberships with the Join button right down there next to the Subscribe button. And if you enjoy this video, you can also send me a super thanks underneath this video. So before we create the procedural material, I did just want to show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So I pressed Shift-A, and I went here to Mesh, and I added an Icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click on the little Add Icosphere settings and open this up, I turned up the subdivisions, and then I just shaded the object smooth. And this way, I have a nice, smooth, subdivided sphere that I can add the material onto. And I am also going to be using the displacements in the Node Editor, so I do want this to be subdivided so it has lots of detail. And then I also added a camera and just pointed the camera at the sphere. Now, for the lighting, I added in these two lights right here. So this first light right over here is just a plane light, and it has an emission material to it. And I gave the emission material a very slight blue color with a strength of 80. And this light will give a nice blue rim light to the sphere. And then for the main light over here, I added another plane, and I gave it a subsurf modifier so that it is round. And then I gave this one an emission material as well, and this one has a slight yellow color with a strength of 40 to give some nice, bright lighting on the sphere. And then to get some nice, realistic lighting and reflections, over here on the world, I added in this Gamrig 1K HDR. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. So if you go right here to the world properties, you can add a new world. And then right here on the color, you can click on the yellow dot. And then you can go right over here and choose Environment Texture. And then just click on Open and open up the HDRI. Now I do want the material to actually displace the mesh to make the rocks more jagged and make them more popping out. So if you want to use the displacements, then you will need to use the Cycles rendering engine. And then I am also going to be using the Adaptive Subdivision. So if you want to use the Adaptive Subdivision, then right here on the Feature Set, you're going to need to set the Feature Set to Experimental to use the Adaptive Subdivision. And then to add the Adaptive Subdivision, you're going to go right over here to the modifier properties, and you're going to click on Add Modifier, and you're just going to add a Subdivision Surface Modifier. And then if you turn the Experimental mode on, you can checkmark the Adaptive Subdivision. So what this is going to do is it's going to add more detail where you're closer up, where the camera can actually see the model, but then farther away, there's going to be less detail. And then this object right here is already pretty subdivided, so I don't need the detail to be super small. So on the Dicing Scale right here, I'm just going to set this to a value of 10. Alright, so we now need to add a material, and then we need to tell the material to use the displacements. So with this object selected, I'm going to click on New here, and I'm going to rename this to Rock Cave Wall. So now I'm going to click right here to go to the Material Properties, and I'm going to go right here and open up the Settings tab. So open up the Settings tab, and go to Surface. So right here on the Displacement, we need to click on the Bump Only, and we need to change this to Displacement and Bump. So this is telling this material that it can use the displacements. And I have the 3D space right here, and I'm in the Rendered view, so you can hold down the Z button and move your mouse up into the Rendered view. And then right over here, I have the Shader Editor, so we can actually create the procedural material. And then there is just one more thing before we get started. I am going to be using the NodeWrangler add-on in this tutorial, so if you don't have the NodeWrangler enabled, you can just click on Edit, and then you can go to the Preferences. And then right over here on the Add-ons tab, you can go right here to the Search, and you can search for the NodeWrangler, and just checkmark the NodeWrangler add-on. And then you can close the User Preferences. So I'm going to start off by pressing Shift-A, and I'm going to go right here to the Search, and I'm going to start by adding a Voronoi texture. So you can search for the Voronoi texture, and I'm going to drop it here. And then because we turned on the NodeWrangler add-on, I can Control-Shift and select different nodes, and that's going to add the Viewer node, and we can preview the node on the object. So there's a few different settings that I want to change here. I want to click on the F3, and I want to change this to F4. And then right over here on the F1, I want to instead change this to F2, and you can see now that texture has changed a little bit. And then I also want to click on this bottom option right here, and I want to instead change this to the Manhattan. Now I also want to use the object coordinates, so with the Voronoi texture selected, I'm going to press Control-T. So that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. That's using another feature from the NodeWrangler add-on. And then I don't actually need the mapping, because the mapping is used to transform the texture. I'm just going to click on the mapping, and then I can press X to delete it. Now I want to use the object coordinates, because the object coordinates is going to place the texture on the object more evenly. So I'm going to take the object, and let's stick that into the vector. And then I also want to change the scale here on the Voronoi. So let's take the scale value, and I'm going to turn this to like a 3.8. Alright, so this texture here is going to be the base for the jaggedy rocks. But I do want to make this texture much more organic and random, and I want to add more noise and more detail. So to do this, I'm going to add a noise texture, and then we're going to make the noise texture so it distorts the placement of the Voronoi. So to do this, let's press Shift-A. I'm going to go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the noise texture, and we're going to stick the noise texture right up here. And then let's Ctrl-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And then I also want to use the object coordinates on the noise texture, so it's placed more evenly on the object. So you can pull out a wire and put the object into the vector. Now I want to make the noise texture much more detailed, so let's turn the scale to like a 6. And then I'm also going to turn the detail all the way up to the max, which is 15. So I'm now going to make the noise texture distort the placement of the Voronoi. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A, and let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the MixRGB, and we're going to stick the MixRGB right here after the Voronoi. So now I'm going to take the color here from the noise texture, and I'm going to stick this into color 2, and then the object coordinates is going to go into color 1. So I'm now going to Ctrl-Shift and select the Voronoi texture to preview it. So if I turn the factor value all the way to 0, it's just going to use the object coordinates, which is color 1. But then if I turn the factor all the way up to 1, it's just going to use the noise texture, which is going into color 2. Now as I move the factor value, if you look at the texture, you can see it's moving around a lot. So to fix this, I'm going to click on the mix here, and I'm going to instead change this to the linear light. This way, the texture is going to stay at the same spot. So now you can see what that's doing. Now I want to take the factor value, and I'm going to turn this to like a 0.1. And this way, it's only using the noise texture a little bit. If you zoom in here, you can see it's mostly using the Voronoi texture, but there is just a little bit of noise there, and this is going to make the rock cave wall look a little bit more organic and natural. Now I also want to add this noise texture into the actual color of the texture. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for another MixRGB, and we're going to stick the MixRGB right here. So what I want to do now is I want to take the factor from the noise texture, and we are going to plug this into color 1 of this mix. And then the Voronoi texture distance is going to go into color 2. And then the factor value is going to blend between only using the noise texture and only using the Voronoi. Now I want to change the factor to like a 0.3, so it's actually using a little bit more of the noise texture, but it is using some of the Voronoi. So now we have a texture with even more noise. Alright, so I can now take the color from this mix and I'm going to put this into the base color, and then I also want this to affect the roughness, so that some parts are a little bit more rough and some parts are a bit more shiny. So let's also take the color from this mix and we're going to put that into the roughness of the principled. And then I want to preview the principled shader, so I'm going to Control-Shift and select the principled shader to preview that. And then I'm just going to box select these nodes and bring them over a little bit. Now this is just looking very white right now, so I do want to change the colors. So to change the colors, I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp and I'm going to click on the color ramp and I'm going to stick it right here between the mix and the base color. So we can now change the colors here in the color ramp, and that's going to actually change the colors of the texture. So the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to click on this drop-down arrow right here, and I'm going to click on Flip Color Ramp. It's going to switch the colors and so you can see that texture much better. And then I'm going to take this black tab and I'm going to drag it out a little bit. And by dragging it out, it's going to make it more contrasty and we're going to be able to see more of that dark color. Now this is a rock material, so I don't want it to be white, I want it to be much more gray. So I'm going to click on the white tab here and then I'm going to click on the color, and I'm going to make this a dark gray. And if you'd like to use the same color that I'm using, right over here on the hex value, you can punch in a hex value of 575757. So that is the gray color that I'm using. And then this one right over here, this is just going to be fully black. So you can set the hex value to six zeros. So I also want to have more control of the roughness, so let's press Shift-A. I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and we're just going to stick the color ramp right here between the mix and the roughness. And then let's click on this white tab, and I want to make this a little bit darker, so I'm going to make this a little bit darker. And you can see as I make it darker, it's going to make the material more and more shiny. So I just want to make it slightly darker, but it's still going to be mostly white. And the white color that I'm going to be using is going to be a hex value of 6Es, so you can punch an E six times on the hex value, if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using. And then I also want to make the darks just a little bit brighter, so I'm going to click on the black tab here, and I'm going to make this color just a little bit brighter, but it's still going to be pretty dark. And the hex value that I'm using for this dark gray is going to be 262626. Alright, so this still really doesn't look much like rock, and that is because it is so smooth. So I want to put a texture into the normal to give it some bump. So to do this, I'm going to take the distance from this Voronoi texture, I'm going to pull out a wire, and I'm going to put this into the normal. Now you can see there's some weird shading issues, and that is because this is black and white data, but this here is normal data. You can see this is a gray dot, whereas this is a purple dot. So I need to convert this data into normal data so the principled shader can actually use it. So I'm going to press shift A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the bump node. We're going to stick the bump node right here in between this wire. And then to actually convert this to normal data, we want to put the distance into the height value of the bump. And now that looks much more like rock. Now this is pretty strong, so on the strength value, I'm just going to turn this way down to like a 0.1. Now that does look very subtle, and that's not very strong, but when we add the texture into the displacement, the displacement is going to add a bunch more detail and a bunch more noise. So I'm just going to leave this at 0.1, but you could turn it up if you want to. So now to make this material look really cool, we're going to be putting some data into the displacement to actually bump out the mesh. So I'm going to take the distance here from the Voronoi, let's pull out a wire, and I'm going to stick this into the displacement of the material output. Now you can see it is working, but something weird is happening. It's all stretched and it's going off to the side, and that is because just like with this bump node, this needs to be displacement data, but this is just black and white data. So we need a node in here to convert the data to displacement data. So let's press Shift-A, let's go here to the search, and I'm going to search for the displacement node, and we're just going to stick the displacement node right here in this wire, so stick it there, and then I'm just going to drag the displacement node down so that it is underneath the principled shader. And then there is a bit of an overlap with this wire here, so if you want to, you can hold down the Shift key, and you can right-click and drag along this wire and let go. That's going to add a reroute, and I can just drag the reroute over here, just to make the preview look a bit nicer. Alright, now if I look at the material, you can see it's not really working. You can see it's just displacing the object over to the side, and that is because we need to actually put the distance value into the height. So right here, I'm just going to pull out this wire from the normal, and I'm going to stick it into the height value of the displacement. And now you can see it is actually converting that to proper displacement data, and so now that is popping out from all sides. Now it is way too strong, and I want to make it much more subtle, so let's take the scale value on the displacement, and I'm just going to turn this down to like a 0.12. And now if I zoom in there, you can see it's definitely displacing it, especially if you look on the sides, you can see there's lots of bumpy bits, and there's all these little jagged bits on the cave wall. And that is it, so that is the procedural material. So I will just give this a final render now.

They guide viewers on setting up the 3D space, creating the icon using gradient and color ramp nodes, and enhancing the material to appear metallic and worn with rust effects. The tutorial also highlights resources such as the creator's Gumroad store and Patreon for purchasing procedural materials, as well as a Blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. Additionally, they thank their sponsor, Sketchfab, and provide information on supporting the channel through various means.","In this Blender tutorial, we will be creating this procedural nuclear or radiation icon in Blender. If you'd like to help support me and this channel as well as purchase the procedural material, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description.

And if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, you can also check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. All the links are in the description. And then one more thing before we start, I want to give a huge thanks to this video's sponsor, Sketchfab. Sketchfab is a 3D model marketplace where you can buy, sell, and even upload your own 3D models and preview them in your browser. You can also purchase models and assets from Sketchfab's huge 3D model store. Use the model inspector to preview the wireframe, matcap, textures, and more before you purchase. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. So real quick, I'm just going to show you how I've set up the 3D space. So I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to go right here and add a plane. And then I'm going to press R to rotate. I'm going to rotate this on the X-axis, and I can type 9, 0, and Enter to rotate it over by 90 degrees. So now the plane is rotated over. And then I also added a camera, and I pointed the camera right at the plane. And then I also wanted to preview this on a sphere, because I think the lighting and reflections look pretty cool on a sphere. So if you want to do that, I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to go right here to Mesh, and I'm going to add an Icosphere. And then right next to me, if you open up the Add Icosphere settings right after you add the Icosphere, I'm just going to turn the subdivisions up to 5, and then I can close this. And this way, we have a nice, smooth Icosphere. It's very subdivided. And then also, using the Object Context menu, I can shade the object smooth. And then I'm just going to bring the Icosphere over. So press G to grab and bring it over on the X-axis. Now I want to preview the nuclear icon on the front of the Icosphere, not the top. So I'm going to hit R to rotate. I'm going to hit X to rotate it on the X-axis, and I can type 9, 0, and then Enter to rotate that over. And then also, because this procedural material is using 3D space, to actually be able to preview the nuclear icon on the sphere, I need to press Tab to go into Edit Mode, press the A key to make sure all the vertices are selected, and I need to press G to grab. And then I'm going to bring this back on the Y-axis and just bring it over there. But just to be able to preview the nuclear icon, we do need to bring the geometry farther back. So I can tab to go back to Object Mode. Now for the lighting, I added in this area light right here, and I pointed it down at the objects. And then I gave it a very slight yellow color. And I also set the power to 4000. And then to get some nice, realistic lighting and reflections right over here in the world, I added in this Hotel Room 1K HDR. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. So if you'd like to use the same HDRI that I'm going to be using, I'll have the link in the description. So I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version on Polyhaven. So if you want to add that in, then you can go over here to the World Properties, you can add a new world. And then if you click here on the color on the yellow dot, you can go right here and add the environment texture. And then you can click on the Open button and open up the HDRI. So I am in the Shading tab, so I have the 3D space right here, and then the shader nodes right here. And I'm also in the rendered view, so I can preview the material. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial. So if you don't have that enabled, you can click on Edit and go to the Preferences. And right over there on the Add-ons tab, you can search for Node Wrangler and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. All right, so I'm going to select the object. Let's click on New here to add a new material. And I can just rename the material. So I'm going to rename this to Procedural Nuclear Icon. And then I can also click and drag and I can drop this material onto this object or just select the object. And then here on the dropdown, you can select the material. So to start off, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a gradient texture. And let's drop the gradient texture right here. And then to preview it, I'm going to Control-Shift and select the gradient texture. And then I also want this gradient texture to use the object coordinates. So with the gradient texture selected, I'm going to press Control-T. That's using the feature from the Node Wrangler, and it's going to add this texture coordinate and mapping. Now I don't need the mapping, so I can just select the mapping and I can press X to delete it. And then I want to use the object coordinates. So let's pull out a wire from the object, and I'm going to put that into the vector of the gradient texture. Now right here on the gradient texture, I don't just want a gradient from black and white because that's what this is right now. I want to click on the linear, and I'm instead going to change this to radial. So if I zoom in here, now you can see it starts off as white, but then as it goes around in a circle, it gets darker and darker. So we can change the colors within this gradient to create the texture for the nuclear icon. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A, and right here on the search, I'm going to search for a ColorRamp node, and let's just drop the ColorRamp node right here after the gradient texture. Now if I start to drag these tabs together, you can see it is making it more contrasty, but there still is that blending right there between black and white. And I don't want that blending there, I want it to be very consistent. So to fix this, I can take the linear right here on the ColorRamp, and I'm going to change this to constant. So now that is constant, and so there's no blending, it's just black and white. So I'm actually going to switch these ColorRamp colors. So I'm going to drag the black tab over here, and drag the white tab right over here. So on the white tab, the position is going to be set to zero, so it's all the way over to this side. So I'm now going to drag the tabs around and make more tabs to make those triangle shapes on the nuclear icon. And I am going to be using specific position values to get the size of the triangles correct. So I'm going to click on this black tab right here, and on the position value on the black tab, I'm going to change this to 0.167, so 0.167. Alright, so now I want to add another white one, so I'm going to hold down the Ctrl key and click right here on the white area to add another white tab, and I'm going to bring this one over. And the specific value that I'll be using for this next white tab is going to be 0.333. So now you can see that we have that triangle shape there. And to figure out the position values, I just did some basic math. So basically what I did is I took 360 degrees, which is all the way around, and I divided that by six, and that way I could figure out how many degrees are in between each one of these pi shapes. And then if I drag these values, you can see the color ramp goes between a value of 0 to a value of 1. So then I use the degree values in between each pi shape, and I figured out how much space needed to be between each one of these. And then I just added that spacing number to each one of these position values. So now what I'm going to do is hold down the Ctrl key and click again right here to add a black tab, and let's drag this one over. And this one, I want this to be right in the very center, because if it's in the very center, then that's going to be flat right there. So in the very center is 0.5. So I'm just going to change this to a value of 0.5. So I'm now going to hold down the Ctrl key and click right here to add another tab, and let's bring this one over. And this next white tab is going to be a position value of 0.667. So 0.667. All right, hold down the Ctrl key, click again to add another tab, and let's drag this one over as well. And this next black one is going to have a position value of 0.833. So 0.833. And then also I'm going to hold down the Ctrl key and click again to make one more white tab, and I'm going to drag this one all the way over to a position value of 1. So now you can see we have these three triangle shapes, and they have an even size. Now these triangles don't go all the way into the center, they kind of end, and so there's basically a circle right in here, and then there's another darker circle in the center. And there also usually is a circle on the outer edge. So to add the circles, I'm going to press B for the box select, and I'm just going to box select these two nodes here, and then I'm going to press Ctrl Shift D. So Ctrl Shift D is going to duplicate the nodes, but it's going to keep the object plugged up from the texture coordinate. So I can just bring these above this one. And then on this color ramp right here, I'm just going to click on the dropdown right here, and I can just click on Reset Color Ramp. So now the color ramp is back to its default settings. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select this color ramp to preview it. Now I want to create a circular shape, so I don't want this gradient texture to be set to radial. So I'm going to click on it, and I'm going to instead change it to spherical. And now we have a circle there. Now again, I don't want to have the blending right here. So on the linear, I'm just going to change this to the constant, and then I can drag the white tab, and that is going to change how big the circle is. And then I actually want to switch these colors, so I'm going to drag the black tab over here. And then I'm going to bring the white tab over to the very end at a position value of zero. And then I can drag the black tab over. And for this black tab, I am going to be using a position value of 0.164. So you can change it to 0.164 if you want to, or you can just change it to the size that you like. And this bigger circle is going to cut off the end of these triangles. Because if I Ctrl Shift and select this color ramp, you can see these triangles just keep on going, but I want them to end and I want them to be within another circle. So if I Ctrl Shift and select back on this color ramp, this circle is going to cut off how far the triangles are going. And then I also want to add a smaller circle in the center to cut off where the triangles start. So I'm going to hold down the Ctrl key and click right here in the white area to add another tab. And I can drag this white tab over and make the circle smaller. So you can see we now have a smaller circle within the bigger circle. And if you want to use the same position value on the smaller circle, so this white tab right here, I'm going to be using a position value of 0.696. That's a size that I've found to work good, but you can of course just eyeball this and get it to a size that you like. And you can of course change this later once we've finished setting up the icon. Alright, so I now want to combine these together. I want to combine the two color ramps together. So I'm going to select one of the color ramps and then hold down the Shift key and select the other color ramp. And I can now press Ctrl 0. And that is using a feature from the Node Wrangler and it's going to add this MixRGB. So I can click on the arrow to open up the MixRGB and I can just bring it over. So what this MixRGB is doing is it's blending these two color ramps together. So I can drag the factor and that's going to go in between each of the color ramps. But I don't want to blend in between them, I just want to add the light values. So right here on this mix I can click on this and I'm going to go right down here and I'm going to change this to lighten. So this way it's just going to add the light values. So now if I turn up the factor you can see that it's becoming more and more white and now we have the shape of that radioactive icon. Now this radioactive icon still needs a few things. It needs a larger circle because I want a larger circle to go around the entire thing. And then it also needs another smaller circle in the center. So let's add those circles. So I'm going to select this gradient texture and then hold down the Shift key and select this color ramp. And again I can press Ctrl Shift D. So Ctrl Shift D is going to duplicate these and I can bring them up. But because I pressed Ctrl Shift D instead of just Shift D, it's going to duplicate these but it's going to keep the texture coordinate plugged up to the gradient texture. So I can now Ctrl Shift and select this color ramp to preview it. And then because we are making circles I want this to still be set to spherical. Now for this color ramp I actually want to switch the colors. So I'm going to click on this black tab right here. I'm going to click on the color and I'm going to make this fully white. And then I can click on this tab over here and this one I'm going to make very dark so fully black. And then this one right here, this one at the starting, I'm going to make this fully black as well. So we basically just flipped those colors. And then I do want to make this larger circle a bit bigger. So I can click on the white tab and I can drag this over and make it a bit bigger. And for this white tab I will be using a position value of 0.089 if you want to use the same position value. Or you can just get it to any size that you like. And then this black one here is going to be all the way at the starting. And then this one here I am going to bring it just back a little bit because I do want to make the smaller circle a bit smaller. So I'm going to drag it more over here to make it smaller. And for this one right here I will be using a position value of 0.769. So now that circle is a bit smaller. So I now want to mix this color ramp in with the lighten. So I'm going to select the color ramp, hold down the shift key and select the lighten. And I can now press ctrl 0. So ctrl 0 is going to add this mix RGB, again that's using a feature from the node wrangler, and it's going to plug them both up. So I can click on the arrow to open this up and bring it over here. Now if I drag the factor all the way up to 1 it's only using the lighten, but if I drag the factor all the way to 0 it's only using the color ramp. So we're blending between the two colors, color 1 and color 2. But instead of just blending between them I just want to add the dark values. So I can click on the mix here and I'm going to change this to darken. So now I can turn the factor value all the way up to 1 and you can now see that it's just adding the dark values. So now we have that nuclear icon. So I'm going to zoom out here and I'm going to press b for the box select and I'm just going to box select these nodes. And I'm going to bring them down and over a little bit just so there's a bit more space here. And then what I want to do is take the color from this darken and I'm going to stick that into the base color of the principled. And then I can ctrl shift and select the principled shader to preview it. And here's where I can show you why I wanted to bring the sphere back in edit mode. If I select the sphere right here and tab into edit mode I can now press g to grab and I can bring this back and forth on the y-axis. So hit y and you can see because this is a procedural material it is using 3d space. And so if you drag this over it's going to look kind of weird. That doesn't look like the nuclear icon. So I need to press g to grab bring this back on the y-axis and I'm going to bring this back here until that looks good. So just about there. And it is important that you do this in edit mode so you're actually pulling back the geometry. You're not just moving the object but you're actually moving the geometry in edit mode. And I do think the nuclear icon looks really cool on a sphere especially because it's round so it kind of catches more reflections. So if you want to add the nuclear icon onto a sphere that's how I would do it. But for now let's look back at the plane. So right now the colors are just black and white but I want to make it kind of a dark gray color and then I want to make the white kind of a yellow color. So to do this I'm going to press shift a. Let's go to the search and I can search for the color ramp node and I'm just going to stick the color ramp node right here between the darken and the principled. So just stick it right there. So I can now change the colors of the color ramp and that's going to change the colors. So on the black tab right here I do want this to be pretty dark but I'm just going to make it a very very dark gray so not fully black. And the hex value that I'll be using for this dark gray color is going to be a hex value of 2 6 2 6 2 6. And then I'm also going to click on the white tab and this one I'm going to make a bright yellow color for the nuclear icon. And the yellow color that I'm going to be using over here on the hex value is going to be f f c a 0 0. So you can punch that in if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using. So that is it for the nuclear icon but I do want to make this nuclear icon look like it is on a metal object and I want to make it look kind of worn and old and even a little bit rusty. So let's do that. So the first thing that I want to do is make it metal. So let's take the metallic value on the principle that I'm going to turn that all the way up to 1. So now it is treated as a metallic material. And then also I do want to make it a bit more shiny so I'm just going to turn the roughness down for now. I am going to be putting a texture into the roughness but for now I'll just turn it down a little bit. Now I do want to give this material a little bit of bump so I'm going to take the color from this final color ramp. I'm going to pull out a wire and I'm going to stick this into the normal to give it some bump. Now you can see that the shading looks really weird and that's because we need to convert this color data into normal data. So I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the bump node and we're going to stick the bump node right here between the color ramp and the normal. So then to actually convert this to normal data we need to take the wire here and we need to put that into the height value. So now it's going to convert that to normal data. So now if you zoom in here and kind of look at the reflections there on the side you can see there is just a little bit of a bump right there on the corners and if I control shift and select the bump node you can see what that's doing. So it's just giving a little bump there on those edges. So I'm going to control shift and select the principled shader again. Now to make this look like an old worn metal material I do want to give it a little bit of noisy bump all over the material so I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the noise texture and I'm going to stick the noise texture right here and put it under the gradient textures. We could even stick these down and kind of bring them closer to each other so that it looks a bit nicer. All right now I also want to use the object coordinates on the noise texture so I can pull out a wire from the object and let's stick that into the vector of the noise texture and then to preview the noise texture I'm going to control shift and select it to preview it. So now let's change some of the settings. So on the scale here I'm just going to turn this to like a two and then I do want it to be very detailed so let's turn the detail all the way to the max which is 15. And then I do just want to give it a little bit of distortion so let's turn the distortion to like a point two. So I now want to take this noise texture and I want to put it into the normal to give it some bump but then I also want to put it into the roughness. Before I do that though I do want to make it a bit more contrasty because it is very grayed out and there isn't any super dark areas. So I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and again we're going to search for another color ramp and I'm going to stick the color ramp right in here right after the noise texture and I can bring it under the other color ramps. So I can now drag this tab over and that is going to make this more darker so I can just bring that over and I'm going to stick it to about there. All right so I can now take this color from the color ramp and I'm going to pull out a wire and I'm going to put this into the roughness first so stick it into the roughness and then I can control shift and select the principled shader. So now if you zoom in here you can see that it isn't the same roughness all over the place some parts are a little bit more shiny and some parts are a little bit more rough because the colors of the color ramp is determining whether it's more rough or more shiny and you can drag the black tab around if you want to be more rough or more shiny you can also drag the white tab over if you want everything to be much more rough. Now I also want to put this color ramp into the normal to give it some bump all over the metal so I'm going to take this bump node and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and I'm going to stick it right here after this bump. So this first bump is already converting this to normal data so the normal can go through the normal but we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So let's take this color from the color ramp I'm going to pull out a wire and I'm going to bring this over you can kind of drag your mouse in the corner and I'm going to stick it into the height value of this bump and so because we're putting it into the height value it's converting the color data into normal data and so now the metal looks very bumpy. Now the metal is definitely way too strong so I want to make it much less strong so let's turn the strength value to like a 0.025 just a 0.025 so now that is much more subtle but if you kind of look here in the reflections you can definitely see some bump there on the metal and it just makes the metal look a bit worn and old. So that is looking pretty cool and we are almost done but I do want to give this metal a little bit of rust. So what I'm going to do is go over here to this noise texture I'm going to select the noise texture and then I'm also going to hold down the shift key and select the color ramp as well. So I'm going to now press ctrl shift d so ctrl shift d is going to duplicate the nodes but it's going to keep the object coordinates plugged up to it and I'm going to bring this up here and I can actually bring the noise texture down maybe move the gradient textures up a bit. So we are going to use this noise texture in this color ramp to create the rust. So to preview it I'm going to ctrl shift and select the color ramp and then to make it less contrasty for now I can just bring the black tab back on the color ramp. Alright so now let's change the settings of the noise texture. So I'm going to turn the scale right here to like a value of 5 and then I do want it to be pretty detailed so I'm going to leave this at 15 and then I do want to add a bit more roughness. You can see if I turn the roughness up it adds just a bunch of little detail and that's going to make it look more like rust. So I'm going to turn the roughness value to like a 0.7 and then I'll also just leave the distortion value at 0.2. Alright so I do want to make this more contrasty as well so I'm going to take these color ramp tabs and I'm going to drag them together and so if I drag them together it's going to be more and more contrasty. So something like that is pretty good for the rust we can of course change it later if we need to. So I now want to take this mask that we've created for the rust and I want to put this into the base color. So I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a mix rgb. Let's add this mix rgb and I'm going to stick this right here between the color ramp and the principled shader. So I can now take this top color ramp and I'm going to pull out a wire and I'm going to stick this into the factor value and then I can control shift and select the mix to preview it. So the color ramp is going into the factor and the factor is telling it where it's going to be color 1 and where it's going to be color 2. So color 1 is going to be the nuclear icon because this color ramp is going into color 1. So color 2 is going to be the rust. So I can click on color 2 and I'm going to make this a pretty dark color and then I'm also going to make it a red color so it looks like rust. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using for the rust over here on the hex value you can punch in 2b 0c 0 0. So that is the exact color that I'll be using for the rust. So I can now control shift and select the principled shader to preview that. So that's looking really cool and if you want to change the amount of rust right up here on this top color ramp you can drag these colors. So if I drag the white tab over there's going to be a lot more rust or if I drag the white tab back you can't see the rust as well. And when I was looking at reference images of the nuclear icons sometimes they have the black here and then the yellow out here but sometimes they were also switched so if you want to switch the colors that is super easy to do. Right here on this color ramp which determines the colors you can just click on the arrow right here and you can click on flip color ramp. And that's going to switch the colors around so now the yellow bits are right there in the triangles and then the black bits are over there. So if you want to change that you can just easily do this by clicking on the arrow and then clicking on flip color ramp. I am going to flip the color ramp so that the dark value is over here on the left side and then the yellow color is over here on the right side. But of course you could change this to your liking. And here is the final rendered image. So this is going to be it for this tutorial so thank you for watching and I hope you enjoyed the tutorial.

And then just one more thing before we start. I wanted to thank this video's sponsor, Sketchfab. On Sketchfab, you can upload, buy, and sell 3D models and assets. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can preview 3D models online in your browser. You can also purchase models and assets from Sketchfab's model store. You can use the model inspector to preview the wireframe, matcap, textures, and more before your purchase. Check out Sketchfab with the link below. Alright, so real quick, let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D scene. So what I did here is I pressed Shift-A, and I went right down here and added an icosphere. And then once I added the icosphere, I subdivided it. And then I also used Blender's proportional editing to scale this out and kind of make it the shape of a potato. It's basically just a sphere, but then I've kind of pulled it out to make it a bit longer. And then I also added a camera and pointed that at the object. Now for the lighting, I added in this plane light right here. So this is just a plane with a subsurf modifier so that it is round. And then I also gave it an emission material with a strength of 50. And then also to help get very realistic lighting and reflections, I added in this Machineshop 02. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. So the link is in the description if you'd like to download it. So when you add a new world, you can click right here on the color, click on the yellow dot, and you can click on Environment Texture, and then you can just open up the HDRI. And I downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. And again, this will just give us some nice realistic lighting and reflections. Now I do want the potato to be a little bit lumpy. So I am going to be using the displacements in the Node Editor to actually displace the mesh and make it a little bit bumpy. If I select the mesh, here is the outline of the mesh. But if I zoom in here, you can see the edges are a bit bumpy. And that is because of this displacement modifier. So if you want to use the displacements in the Node Editor, then you need to make sure you're using the Cycles render engine. Because the Node Editor displacements won't work in Blender EV. So just make sure you are using Cycles. And then so that the displacement has some actual geometry to work with, just make sure your object is somewhat subdivided. So again, I just used an icosphere. So it has a lot of detail. So the displacements in the Node Editor can actually use this geometry to displace the mesh. So I am in the shading tab right here. And I am going to hold down the Z button, go up into the rendered view. Just so that I can preview that in the rendered view. And just select your potato object. And then I have the shader editor right here. So I am going to click on New. And I can just rename this to Procedural Potato. And then one more thing I need to do for the displacement settings. Now that we've added the material, I can click right down here on the material properties. And you need to go right here to the settings tab. And then right here on the displacement, we want to click on the bump only. And we want to change this to displacement and bump. And so this way we are telling the material that it can use the displacements. So I'm just going to make this smaller. Just kind of bring that in. And then I am also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can just click on edit and go to the preferences. And then right over here on the add-ons tab, you can just search for the Node Wrangler. And then you can just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So you can just close the user preferences. So I'm going to start off by creating a texture for the base color. So I'm going to press shift A. Let's go to the search. And I want to search for the Musgrave texture. And let's just add this in here. And then because we turned on the Node Wrangler add-on, I can control shift and select different nodes. And that is going to preview the nodes on the object. And then with the Musgrave texture selected, I'm also going to press control T. And that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I want to use the object coordinates. So I'm going to take the object and I'm going to put that into the vector of the mapping. And this way, by using the object coordinates, the texture is placed on the object more evenly. So now let's change some of the Musgrave settings to make it look more like a potato. So I'm going to turn the scale to like a 6. And then I also want to turn the detail up so it's very detailed. So I'll turn this up to like an 8. So now it's pretty detailed. And then I want to turn the dimension down. I want to turn it down a lot. And if I turn it down, you can see there's much more detail and it looks much more rough. Now I don't want to turn it down all the way to 0. So I'm just going to turn it down to like a 0.2. But now there is a lot more detail. Now right now the texture is just black and white. And so I want to change those colors. So to change the colors of the texture, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for the color ramp. And we're just going to drop the color ramp right in here after the Musgrave texture. So now I can change the two tabs of the color ramp. And that's going to actually change the color of the texture. So I can click on the black tab. And for this one, I'm going to make this brighter. And then I'm going to make it kind of a brownish-orangey color. But it is going to be a little bit yellow. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using, you can go over to the hex value and you can punch in 946F3C. So that is the exact color that I'll be using. And then for this one right over here, this is going to be kind of a brown color as well. So let's make it a little bit darker and kind of make it brown. But I do want to bring this a little bit more over to the red. And I do want to make it darker. So it's kind of a brownish-reddish color. And the hex value that I'll be using for this darker color is going to be 542818. So let's zoom out here. And I want to take the texture coordinate and the mapping. And I just want to bring these down because we are going to be using the texture coordinate and the mapping for the other textures. And I'll just bring the muskgrave and the color ramp up here. So we now have some nice detail in there. You can see there's all that little bits of detail. But I also just want to add some procedural noise. And then I want to mix that in to the base color. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for the noise texture. And we are going to stick the noise texture underneath the muskgrave texture. And then I can Control-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And then just like all the textures, I want to use the object coordinates. So let's take the vector from the mapping. And we're going to put that into the vector of the noise texture. So now the noise texture is placed on the object more evenly. So let's change some of the settings here. So I'm going to turn the scale to a 4. And then I do want to have lots of detail. So let's turn the detail up all the way to the max, which is 15. And then I also want to add a little bit more roughness. So I'm going to turn this roughness value to a 0.55. So there's just a little bit more roughness. Alright, now again, this is just a black and white texture. And I want to change the colors to make it be the colors of a potato. So I'm going to click on this color ramp. And I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate. And I'm just going to drop this right here. Now I want to change these colors around a little bit. I want them to be similar, but I want them to be a bit different. So one thing that I want to do is take this brown color, this darker brown. And I want to bring it out a little bit. And so when I bring it closer, more of the color is actually going to be that dark brown. So I'm going to bring it to about here. And then I'm going to click right here on this color. And I'm going to make it a little bit darker. And the hex value that I'll be using for this very dark brown is going to be 32120E. And then also for this one here, I want this one to be a little bit more towards the yellow. So I'm going to make it a bit more towards the yellowish. And the hex value that I'll be using for this lighter brown is going to be 94723B. Alright, so I can Control-Shift and select between these different nodes. And we now have these two cool textures. So I want to combine these two textures together. So I'm going to select this color ramp and then hold down the Shift key and select this color ramp. So I can now press Control-0. And Control-0 is going to add this MixRGB. And you can just click on the arrow to open it up. And I'm going to stick it right over here. So the MixRGB is going to plug these both together. And then I can change the factor value. And that is going to change between each color ramp. Now I'm going to take the factor value and I'm going to turn that to like a 0.8. And that way it is mostly the noise, but then there's also a little bit of the Musgrave as well. And I can press the B key for the Box Select. Just Box Select all these nodes. And I'm going to bring them back a little bit so there's a little bit more space. Now potatoes also usually have little dark dots. So I'm going to add the little dark dots now. So let's press Shift-A. I'm going to go to the Search. And to do this, I can add a Voronoi texture. So let's click on the Voronoi. And I'm just going to stick this underneath the noise texture. And then I can Control-Shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. Now the scale is way too big. So I'm going to make that smaller. So let's turn the scale value to like a 10 so we can see those dots better. And then I also want to take the vector from the mapping. And let's put that into the vector of the Voronoi. And that also will make the Voronoi texture smaller so we can see more of those dots. Now if you zoom in here, you can see the edges are a little bit sharp. So I'm going to click on the F1. And I'm going to change this to Smooth F1. And that way, it is much more smooth. So you can see those dots are much more round and smooth. Now the dots are very perfectly round. And I want to make them a bit more random and organic. So I actually want to add a node in here to distort the placement of the Voronoi texture. And that way, there will be a little bit more noise. And the dots will kind of have a random shape. So to do this, I'm going to press B for the box select. Just box select these nodes. And I can bring them over so there's a bit more space here. So I'm now going to press Shift A. And let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a noise texture. And I want to stick the noise texture right in here between the mapping and the Voronoi. So now that we've done this, the noise texture is actually distorting the placement of the Voronoi texture. And then there are a few settings that I want to change here. So on this noise texture, let's just turn the scale to like 10. And then I also want to give it more detail. So let's turn the detail all the way to the max, which is 15. Now, this is distorting it way too much. And I do want to be able to see the Voronoi texture. So what I'm going to do is press Shift A. And let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for the Mix RGB. Let's click on this. And I'm going to drop it right in here between the noise texture and the Voronoi. So I'm now going to take the vector from the mapping. And I'm going to pull out a wire. And I'm going to put that into color 1. And then this noise texture is going to go into color 2. So now if we turn the factor down, it's not going to use the noise texture at all. But then as I turn this up, the noise texture is going to affect the Voronoi more and more. Now, you can see that it's moving the texture around a lot. And I don't want it to be moving around so much. So I can click on the Mix here. And I'm going to change this instead to Linear Light on the Mix RGB. And that way, when I drag the factor, you can see this texture is pretty much staying at the same spot. But it's being distorted. Now, I just want it to be distorted a tiny little bit. So I'm going to turn the factor to a 0.05. Just a 0.05. And now you can see those dots are still clearly visible. But they do look very random. And they're a little bit distorted. And they have a lot of noise. So I now want to make these little dots more sharp and contrasty. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the Search. And I'm going to search for another color ramp. Let's click on the color ramp. And I'm going to drop it right here after the Voronoi. So you can just stick it underneath these color ramps. So I can now take the white tab. And I can drag the white tab closer. And you can see it's going to sharpen up the edges. So now the dots are a bit smaller. And the edges are sharper. So I'm going to drag this way over so it is pretty close. And then I can also click on the black tab. And I can drag this over a little bit so that that's a bit stronger as well. So now the dots are much more contrasty. But then most of the potato is just that white color. So I now want to mix the dots in with the color. So I'm going to select this color ramp. And then hold down the Shift key and select this mix. I can now press Ctrl-0. And Ctrl-0 is going to add a mix RGB. And it's going to plug the selections up. So I can open the mix RGB by clicking on the arrow. And I'm just going to bring it right up here. Now for this one, I actually want to take this color ramp. And I want to put this into the factor. So the factor value is going to tell it where it's going to be color 1. And where it's going to be color 2. And then I want this mix right here to go into color 2. So now this is going to make color 1 be the dark dots on the potato. So I can just click on color 1. And I'm going to make this a darker color. And I'm going to make it a brown color. And again, if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using for those little dots here on color 1. You can go to the hex value. And you can punch in 492F1E. So that is the color that I'll be using for those little dots there. So this is the final base color. So I can just take the color. And I'm going to stick that into the base color of the principled. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader. Now I want the texture to also control the roughness. Because I want the potato to be more rough. But I want some areas to be a little bit more rough. And other parts to be a little bit more shiny. So I'm going to take this second mix. I'm going to take the color. And I'm going to stick that into the roughness. Now it's super shiny. And we don't want a super shiny potato. Potatoes are usually pretty rough. They're not very reflective. So to control this better. I'm going to press shift A. Let's go to the search. And I can search for a color ramp. And we're going to stick the color ramp right here. So now we can change these colors. And that is going to control how rough or shiny it is. So I can click on the black tab. And I can click here on the color. And I can turn this up. And you can see as I turn it up. It's going to make the potato much more rough. So I'm just going to make this kind of a light brown color. And I'll be using a hex value of A7, A7, A7. So now the potato is much more rough. But it still is a little bit shiny. Now this potato is very smooth. And potatoes usually are a little bit rough. They have a little bit of roughness and bump on the surface. So I'm going to be adding some values into the normal. To give it some bump over the surface. So I'm going to start with this noise texture. Because I want to add a little bit of noise all over the potato. So I'm going to take the factor from the noise texture. And I'm going to pull out a wire. And I'm going to stick that into the normal. Now you can see there's some weird shading issues. There's like these dark areas. And that's because we need to convert this color data into normal data. So to do this I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a bump node. And we can just click on the bump node. And I'm just going to stick it right here in this wire. So now the noise texture factor can go into the height value of the bump. And that way it's going to convert it to normal data. And the normal can just go into the normal. So now you can see that potato looks very bumpy. Now this is way too bumpy. So I'm going to take the strength value. And I'm going to turn this way down to like a 0.15. Just a 0.15. So if I zoom in there. Now you can see there is a little bit of a texture. There's a little bit of noisy bump there. But it's not too strong. Alright. Now if I Control-Shift and select this color ramp. I also want to add these little dots here into the bump. To make those dots just a little bit bumpy. So I'm going to Control-Shift and select the principled shader again. So I can select the bump node. And I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it. And I'm going to stick this right after the first bump. So the first bump has already converted this to normal data. So the normal can just go through the normal. So we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So I'm going to take the color from this color ramp. I'm going to pull out a wire. And I'm going to plug this into the height value of the second bump. And then if I make this stronger. You can see what it's doing. So now it's making that very bumpy. I don't want it to be that strong though. So I'm just going to keep the strength value at 0.15. I think 0.15 is pretty good. And then I also want to invert it. I'm just going to click on the invert button. Because if you zoom in there to the bumps. If it's not inverted. Those bumps look like they're going back in a little bit. So I'm going to check mark the inverted. And that way the bumps look like they're coming out just a little bit. And then I also want to take the final base color. And I want to put that into the normal as well. So I'm going to click on this first bump. And I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it. And I'm going to stick it right here after these first two. So again the normal can just go through the normal. So I can now take the second mix here. I'm going to take the color. And I'm going to stick that into the height value. And then I do want to make it pretty subtle. If I zoom in there. You can see there's the noise taking effect. But I do want it to be even more subtle. So I'm just going to turn the strength value of this last bump to just a 0.1. So now you can see we have some nice bump there all over the potato. Alright so this is definitely starting to look like a potato. But I do want to make the potato kind of lumpy. So that is where the displacement comes in. So we are going to plug some data into the displacement. To actually displace the mesh. So to do this I'm going to press shift A. Let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for another noise texture. Let's click on the noise texture. And I'm just going to stick it right down here. And then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Now again I want this texture to be placed very evenly on the object. So I'm going to go right over here to the mapping. And I'm going to pull out a wire from the vector. And then I'm going to bring my mouse over. And I'm going to stick that into the vector of the noise texture. And then let's play around with some of the settings. So I just want this noise texture to give some really big lumps. To actually displace the mesh. So I'm just going to turn the scale value to like 1. So that way there are just some big lumps of color. So I can now take the factor value from this noise texture. I'm going to pull out a wire. And I'm going to bring this up here. And stick it into the displacement value on the material output. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader. So you can see it's doing something. But it's really weird. It's kind of being displaced out to the side. And that is because this is color data. But then this needs to be displacement data. So we need a node in here to convert the color data to displacement data. So let's press shift A. Let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for the displacement node. And I'm going to stick the displacement node right here in this wire. And I can just bring it down. And then to actually convert it to displacement data. We want to take the noise texture factor. We can actually bring this over. And let's take the noise texture factor. And I'm going to put that into the height value instead. So now it is displacing the mesh. And we need to make this much more subtle. So we can take the scale value. And we can turn that down to make it more subtle. So I'm just going to turn the scale value to like a .15. I'm just going to do a .15. So now it is displacing the mesh. If you look around here, you can definitely see there's some little lumps in the potatoes. But it is much more subtle. And then also, if I zoom out here, you can see this wire going from the mapping to the noise texture. It's overlapping on all these nodes. So what I'm going to do is hold down the shift key. And then I'm going to right click and drag. And drag a line over the wire. And then let go. And this is going to add what's called a reroute. And this isn't actually going to change how the material looks. But I can just bring the reroute over. And that way, this wire is going to go down and then over. And there won't be any overlapping. So it just kind of makes the material look a bit nicer. And then I can also press B for the box select. Just box select these nodes. And I can bring them a bit closer. Just to kind of make that a bit smaller. So this is looking a lot like a potato. But I do just want to add a tiny little bit of subsurface scattering. To allow just a little bit of light to go through the potato. And it'll just make the potato look a little bit more soft. And make it look a little bit more like food. So if I zoom in here to the principled shader. I'm going to take the subsurface value. And I'm going to make this a very small value of 0.03. So just 0.03. So it is going to be pretty subtle. But you can see it's kind of white looking. So I can now take the subsurface color right here. And I'm going to make this kind of a yellowy orangey color. And if you want to use the same subsurface color that I'm using. Over here on the hex value. You can punch in E78B19. So I think that subsurface really helps. It just makes it look a bit more soft. And makes it look much more organic and natural. And it looks more like food. With just that little bit of subsurface. So that is the procedural material. Although there is just one more thing that I want to do. I want to be able to duplicate the potato object. And have the textures kind of be randomized a little bit. And kind of have the displacement be randomized a little bit as well. And that way if I just duplicate the potato. Then the potatoes will look a little bit different. So to do this I'm going to press Shift-A. And I'm going to go to the search. And I'm going to search for the object info node. And I'm going to put the object info node right here under the texture coordinate. And I can also bring the texture coordinate up. So I can now take the random value from the object info. And I can stick this into the location of the mapping. And so this way the random of the object info. Is going to randomly change the location of the mapping. And the mapping is plugged up to all of these different textures. So that way each time I duplicate this potato object. It's going to randomize the placement of the textures. And it's also going to randomize the placement of this noise texture. And that will change the displacement. And what you could also do is duplicate the potatoes. And then in edit mode with the proportional editing on. You can select some vertices. And just kind of play around with the shape. To make each potato just look a little bit different. So that's it for this tutorial. So I hope you found this helpful. And thank you for watching. And if you'd like to help support me and this channel. As well as purchase the material.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZQ3BjXDjSg,Procedural Coral Rock Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural coral rock material in Blender using the displacements in the node editor, which requires the Cycles rendering engine. The process involves setting up a 3D scene with lighting, using a Voronoi texture to create patterns of holes on the coral rock, and employing noise textures and color ramps to add randomness and color variations to the material. The tutorial also mentions the use of adaptive subdivision for detailed geometry and suggests using the Node Wrangler add-on for efficient node management. Additionally, viewers are offered options to purchase the material or support the creator via Gumroad, Patreon, and YouTube. Links for further resources and material packs are provided in the video description.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural coral rock material in Blender. If you'd like to help support the channel and purchase this material, then you can do that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs to purchase more of my materials. And if you'd like to learn how to create more procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist where I show you how to create all of my procedural materials. So for this procedural material, I am going to be using the displacements in the node editor. So if you want to use the displacements in the node editor, then you will need to use the cycles rendering engine for this tutorial. So let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So what I did is I added an icosphere and I subdivided it a few times so that it has some detail. And I do want this to be pretty subdivided because I am going to be giving it the displacements because it needs some extra geometry to actually displace the mesh. And then I also added a camera here and I pointed the camera at the icosphere. Now for the lighting, I added in these two lights right here. So this first light right here is just a plane and I gave it a subdivision surface modifier so that it is round. And then I scaled it up really big and I gave it an emission material with a strength of 100. And then I also gave it a bright blue color and I wanted to give it a bright blue color because this is a coral rock, so this is the kind of rock that might be underwater. And so I wanted to give it some blue light to make it look like it might be near a body of water or maybe underwater. And then I also added this other light right here and this is a plane which is kind of stretched up. And I gave this plane a material with an emission and this emission has a strength of 50. And I gave this a very slight yellow color. And then also to get some blue reflections on the bottom here, on the bottom of the coral rock, I just added this plane right here and I just gave this plane a blue color just so that some blue reflections reflect off of the plane and give a little bit of a blue color on the coral rock. And then to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections, over here on the world I added in this Felzen Labyrinth 1k HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, link is in the description if you'd like to download it. So you can just add a new world and then you can click here on the color, click on the yellow dot, and you can choose the environment texture and then you can just open up the HDRI. So now I'm going to set up the displacement settings. So just select whatever object you want to add the material onto and then you can click on new here to add a new material. And I can just rename this to procedural coral rock. So now we need to change some of the settings so that it can actually use the displacements. So I'm going to click right up here on the render properties and make sure here on the render engine that you are using the cycles render engine because the node editor displacements doesn't work in Eevee. So make sure you're using cycles if you want to use the displacements. And then I am also going to be using the adaptive displacements. So if you want to use the adaptive displacement, I'm going to be setting this feature set here to experimental. So now that this is set to experimental, I can go right over here to the modifier properties, and I gave this object a subdivision surface modifier. So you can click on add modifier and add the subdivision surface. And because we turned on the experimental mode, we now have the adaptive subdivision. So I'm going to click on that to turn it on, and then I will just turn the dicing scale of five. So this way, where we're closer up to the mesh, it's going to subdivide it more and give it more detail for the displacements. But then if we're farther away, it'll give it less detail. Now there is one more thing we need to do to get the displacements to work. We need to click right down here on the material properties, and then I'm going to close this and I'm going to scroll down here, go to the settings, and under the surface tab under settings, we need to change the displacement from bump only to displacement and bump. So this is telling this material that it can use the displacements. So I'm just going to make this smaller. And then just one more thing I'm going to do before I set up the material, I'm going to be using the node wrangler add-on. So if you don't have the add-on enabled, you can just click on edit and go to the preferences. And then over there in the add-ons tab, you can search for the node wrangler and just checkmark the node wrangler add-on. All right, so we can now start with the procedural material. So to start off, I want to create a texture that we can use to make all those little holes in the rocks. So to do this, I'm going to press shift A, let's go to the search here, and I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture. And we're just going to drop the Voronoi texture here. And then because the node wrangler add-on is turned on, I can control shift and select different nodes. And that's going to add this viewer node here, and we can preview the different nodes on the objects. And then with the Voronoi texture selected, I'm also going to press control T, that is going to add the texture coordinate in the mapping. And then I want to use the object coordinates. So I'm going to plug the object into the vector. And by using the object coordinates, it's going to place the texture on the object more evenly. Now I don't actually need the mapping node because the mapping node just changes the location and rotation and scale the texture, I'm just going to click on the mapping node and press x to delete it, I can just bring the texture coordinate over. So now let's change some settings on the Voronoi. So I want to turn the scale up a bit. So I'm going to turn the scale value up to like a 14. Now I also want it to be a little bit more smooth. So I'm going to click on this f1 right here. And I'm going to change this to smooth f1. So this is pretty much exactly the same except that we now have this smoothness value, I can make this a little bit bigger, so you can see it. So if I turn the smoothness value all the way to zero, now it's just acting like the normal f1. But then I can turn the smoothness value up. And now right in here in between those dots, it's going to be more smooth. Now I do want it to be a little bit smooth, but not that much. So I'm just going to turn the smoothness value to like a point two. So a point two is pretty good. Now I also want to give a tiny little bit of distortion to the circles because the circles are very smooth and round. So I'm going to add a node in here to actually change the vector of the Voronoi. So it's going to change how the texture is placed on the object. So I'm going to press shift a, let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for a noise texture. And we're going to drop the noise texture right in here. So now the noise texture is distorting the placement of the Voronoi texture. And then let's change some settings here. So I want to turn the scale up. So I'm going to turn this up to like a 15. So it is smaller. And then I do want to give this noise texture lots of detail. So let's bring the detail all the way up to the max, which is 15. Now if you look at the texture, you can see that it's totally gotten rid of the Voronoi look. So it doesn't have all those little dots. And that's because the noise texture is distorting the Voronoi way too much. So I want to make it less strong of an effect. So I'm going to press shift a, let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for the mix RGB. And we're just going to stick the mix RGB in between the noise texture and the Voronoi. So now I want to mix the noise texture with the original object texture coordinates. So I'm going to take the object from the texture coordinate, and I'm going to put that into color one. And then this noise texture, the color here can go into color two. So I can now change this factor value. And if I turn the factor all the way to zero, it's not using the noise texture at all. But then if I turn the factor all the way up to one, it's using all of the noise texture. So I can now just change this to my liking. Now as I change the factor value, it's kind of moving the texture around. So to make that not happen, I can click on this mix right here and I can change this to linear light. So now if I change the factor value, you can see it's not really moving the texture around. It's staying where it is. So I want to make this very, very subtle because I do want to be able to see mostly the dots, but I just want the dots to be distorted a little bit. So they look a little bit more organic and natural. So on the factor value right here, I'm going to turn this way down to a 0.01. So just a 0.01. So if you zoom in there, it is very subtle, but you can see without it, it's just perfectly straight. Especially if you zoom into one of these, if you turn the factor all the way to zero, it is very smooth and circular. But then if you turn the factor to 0.01, now it's just a little bit distorted and you can also see there's just a little bit of subtle noise there, and that's going to make it look more organic. So I'm going to press B for the box select, click and drag a box around these nodes, and I'm going to bring them back a little bit and also bring them down. So I now want to put this into the normal to give it some bump. So what I'm going to do is take the distance here from the Voronoi, and I'm going to stick that into the normal of the principled BSDF. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now you can see there's a really weird effect here, and that is because this is black and white data. You can see there is a gray dot right here, but this is normal data because it is a purple dot. So what we need to do is put a node in here to convert the color data or the black and white data into normal data so the principled shader can actually use it. So to do this, I'm going to press shift A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the bump node, and we're going to stick the bump node right in here between the Voronoi and the principled. And then to convert it to normal data, we actually want to take the distance and we want to put that into the height value. So now you can see it actually looks like it's bumping out the mesh. Now this is a bit strong and I do want to have it less strong, so I'm going to turn the strength value to like a 0.4. So a 0.4 and now you can see it's not quite as strong. Now if you look here on the sides, you can see it's not actually popping out the mesh, and that is because the normal is just a fake bump. So it appears as though it's displacing the actual mesh shape, but it's actually just a fake bump. So we are going to use the normal, but then we are also going to use the displacement to actually displace the mesh. But the normal will still help to add more detail to the material. So I'm going to take the Voronoi texture distance, and I'm going to pull out a wire, and I'm going to bring my mouse right up here, and I'm going to stick this into the displacement of the material output. Now you can see that it is doing something, but it's really messed up, and that is again because this is black and white data. This is just color data, but then this over here, this needs to be displacement data. So we need a node in here to convert the color data or the black and white data into displacement data. So I'm going to press shift a, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the displacement node, and I'm going to stick the displacement node right here in this wire. And then I can just drag the displacement right down here and stick it underneath the principled shader. And I think I'll actually just box select these nodes and bring them down a little bit. All right, now to actually convert this to displacement data, I actually want to put this distance value right here into the height of the displacement. And now it is actually displacing the mesh, and that is starting to look very cool. And you can even see there's those little circles there from this Voronoi texture. Now it is way too strong. It's like bumping out a lot, and it's super sharp. So I want to make it much more subtle. So on the displacement node right here, I can just turn the displacement way down the scale here. So I'm going to turn the scale down to like a 0.14, just a 0.14. And now that is looking much better. And that is starting to look very cool. So now you can see we have all those little dots in there, and then those other parts which are kind of popping out. And this is very white. So just for now to be able to see this a bit better, I'm going to take the base color, and I'm going to make that kind of a dark color. And it kind of allows you to see that a bit better. But later on, we will be adding another texture into the base color to change the actual color. Now I want a little bit more randomness in the displacement, because right now it's kind of even all over, and it's all just popping out, and it's pretty sharp. But I want some areas to be kind of going back in and some areas to be coming out. And also I don't want all of the little holes to be all over the rock. I just want it to be in some places here and there. So what I'm going to do is click on this noise texture, and I want to duplicate it. So I'm going to press Shift-D. That's going to duplicate the noise texture. And actually what you can do is you can select the noise texture, and you can instead press Control-Shift-D. So Control-Shift-D is going to duplicate the node, but it's going to keep the wire plugged up to it. So I'm going to just bring this noise texture over here and stick it underneath the Voronoi. And we are going to use this noise texture in the displacement to kind of change it up a bit, and also give it a little bit more noise. Now I'm going to Control-Shift and select the noise texture so that I can preview it. So I want to change the scale of this, because that is way too small. There's like lots of detail. So I'm going to turn the scale right here to just like a 2, and that way there are some much bigger colors. You can see some parts are lighter and some parts are darker. But then I do want to leave the detail up to the max, which is 15, because I do want it to be very detailed. So we are going to use this noise texture and mix it into the displacement. Before we do that though, I do want to make it more contrasty. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the mix RGB. And I'm going to stick the mix RGB right here before the displacement node. So this mix RGB is going to allow us to mix colors together. So I can now take the factor from the noise texture, and I'm going to put it into this factor here of the mix RGB. And then I can also Control-Shift and select the mix RGB to preview it. So we are mixing the noise texture and the Voronoi together. And I also want to take color 2, and I want to make this fully black. Now you can see that it's not doing a whole lot, and that is because this noise texture is actually pretty grayed out, and I want to make it more contrasty. So to make it more contrasty, I can press Shift-A. Let's go to the search, and I can search for the color ramp. And I'm just going to stick the color ramp right here between the noise texture and the mix. And then just to preview it, I can Control-Shift and select the color ramp. So you can see it's very gray. Some parts are a little bit lighter, and some parts are a little bit darker, but it is pretty gray. So if I now take these two color values, and I drag them together, it's going to make it more contrasty. And also you can see that as I make it more contrasty, it's going to distort the displacement more, because the displacement node uses the white values and the dark values to know how much it's going to displace the mesh. So I'm going to drag the black tab over here, and then I'm also going to drag the white tab out to about here, so pretty close. So now you can see where those dark parts are, they're popping out more, but then where the light parts are, they're going back in a bit. And that's going to give more randomness to the object and give it a better shape. So I can now hold down the Control-Shift key, and then select the principled shader to preview it. So you can now see that the object shape is much more random, because some parts over here are more flat, but then there's also some other parts right over here where the mesh is bumping out a lot more. And also some of these areas have deeper holes, whereas some other parts over here don't have any holes. Now I do also want to change the color of the Voronoi texture, because I do want to bring out those holes a little bit and make them a bit sharper. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the ColorRamp node. Let's click on the ColorRamp, and I'm going to drop it right in here after the Voronoi texture. And I'm going to press B for the box select, just box select these nodes and bring them back a little bit. So everything after the Voronoi texture, I actually want to use the ColorRamp instead. So what I'm going to do is actually take the color here from this ColorRamp and put that into the height value of the bump, and I can just bring this up. So now the Voronoi texture is going into the ColorRamp, and then the ColorRamp can go into the bump and the mix. So if I look at those holes, you can see they're not actually super sharp. So what I can do is I can take this white tab right here, and I can drag it over. And now that I've dragged this over, this ColorRamp is sharpening up the values because we are bringing it over, and so now those holes have a much sharper opening. So now you can really see there's that contrast between these smooth areas, you can see there's some smooth areas here, and then the bigger areas right here where the noise texture is. And where it is popping out more, those holes are also deeper, whereas right over here where the mesh is smoother, the holes aren't popping out quite as much. Now those holes are actually pretty deep, you can see how dark they are. So if I change this black tab right here, that is going to make the holes less deep. So if I click on the black tab, I can turn it up, and if I turn the black tab really high up, you can see now those holes aren't very deep. But if I turn it down and make it darker, then the holes are going to be deeper. So I'm just going to change this color to kind of like a dark gray, and so now those holes aren't quite as deep, but they are still pretty deep. Now I also want to give this object just some noisy bump all over the mesh, because if I zoom in here to the smooth areas, you can see they're very smooth, and that's not really realistic. So what I can do is I can take this noise texture and I can put it into the bump. So I'm going to take this bump node, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it, and I'm just going to drop it right here. And then I can bring these nodes over. So this bump node is converting the voronoi texture into normal data, and then this bump node, the bump can just go through the normal, and then the normal into the normal. So now on this bump node, we have this extra height value that we can add data into. So what I can do is I can take the factor from this noise texture, I can pull out a wire, and I'm going to bring this over and stick it into the height value of the second bump, and that way it's going to convert that to normal data. Now it is a bit strong, so I'm just going to take the strength value on the second bump and just turn that down to like a 0.3, so it's not quite as strong. But now that coral rock has a bunch of noise all over the place. All right, now I also want to put this noise texture into the roughness so that some parts are a little bit more rough, and then other parts are a little bit more shiny. So I'm going to take the factor, let's pull out a wire, and I'm going to bring this all the way over, and I'm going to stick it into the roughness value of the principal. Now I want to have more control over this, so I'm going to press shift a, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the color ramp node, and let's stick the color ramp right in here before the roughness. So I can now change the color ramp colors, and that'll make it more rough or more shiny. So I can click on the black tab here, and if I turn the black tab up and make it more white, you can see that now that rock is very very rough. Now I don't want it to be super rough, I do want it to be a little bit shiny, so I'm just going to make this kind of like a gray color. So just something like this, kind of like a dark gray color. So we are almost done with this material, but right now this base color is just gray, and I want to give it a few different colors, kind of make some brownish colors and some reddish colors. So what I want to do is I want to use another noise texture so that the colors are a little bit different and random. So let's click on this noise texture, and I'm going to press ctrl shift d to duplicate it, and let's bring it up here, and the object is still plugged up to the vector. And then I can ctrl shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So this is very detailed, and the scale has turned up quite a bit, but I don't want the scale to be turned up that big, so I'm going to turn the scale down to just like an 8. But then I do want it to be very detailed, so I'll leave the detail to the max, which is 15. So I can now just take the factor value, I'm going to pull out a wire, and I'm going to bring this over, and I'm going to stick this into the principled shader. And then I can ctrl shift and select the principled to preview it. Now right now it's just kind of white and black, and so I want to change the colors. So let's just click on this color ramp, and I can press shift d to duplicate it, and we're going to stick it right here in the wire going before the base color. So for this first tab right here, I'm going to drag this out a little bit, kind of bring it over to here, and then I'm going to click on the color, and I'm going to make this color kind of like a dark brownish reddish color. And if you want to use the same color that I'm using over here on the hex value, you can punch in 3 1 1 4 0 b. That's the color that I'll be using. And then I'm also going to bring this tab out a bit, kind of bring it into the center here, and then this one I just want to make kind of like a brown color, and make it a little bit darker. And again to use the same color that I'm using, you can go to the hex, and you can type in 8 a 5 d 4 0. And then I do want to add one more color. I want to add kind of a lighter color. So I'm going to hold down the control key, and then just click right here to add another tab, and I'm going to drag this tab over here. And then this color is going to be similar, but it's going to be a bit brighter, and a bit more of a tannish kind of yellowish color. And the hex value for this one is going to be b f 9 b 7 c. So those are the colors that I'm going to be using. So now you can see we have some really nice colors there for the coral rock. And then just one last thing that I did real quick, if you go right over here to the render properties right down here on the color management, I set the view transform to filmic for more realistic lighting, and I set the look here to a very high contrast. And that's going to pop out the colors and make everything more contrasty. So that is it, that is the finished procedural material. So I'll just give this a final render.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ECeHoATa74,Procedural Tree Bark (Blender Tutorial),"The video is a Blender tutorial on creating a procedural tree bark material. The instructor discusses improving their skills over the past year and offers a new method to create a realistic tree bark using various textures and nodes in Blender. They explain the setup of the 3D space, lighting, and rendering settings necessary for the project, including using adaptive displacements and the Cycles rendering engine. The tutorial also covers the creation of moss and the addition of bump and displacement maps to enhance realism. The instructor mentions the availability of the material for purchase and provides links to additional resources and tutorials.",In this blender tutorial I will show you how to create this procedural tree bark material in blender. So about a year ago I made another tutorial on how to make procedural tree bark but I really wasn't too happy with the result and ever since then I've been wanting to create a really nice tree bark material. But it's been a year of creating procedural materials and I really think I've improved my skills over the year and so just recently I created this really cool procedural tree bark and I really like this result so that's what I'm going to show you how to create in this video. If you'd like to purchase this procedural material and help to support this channel then you can do that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description and you can also check out my blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my materials and if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials you can also check out my blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. All the links are in the description. So real quick I'm just going to show you what I have set up in the 3d space. So I like to preview my procedural materials on spheres so I just added this icosphere and I subdivided the icosphere so it's nice and round but then I also wanted to preview this material on a cylinder because it is a tree bark material so it's going to be added on a tree stump or a tree trunk. So I just added this cylinder here and then I just kind of extruded and insetted the faces here and I also gave it a lot of loop cuts and that is because we are going to be using the displacements in the node editor to actually displace the mesh so I do want it to be somewhat subdivided. So that's what I did in the 3d scene with these two objects just to preview the materials and then I also added a camera and pointed the camera at the objects. Now for the lighting I added in these two plane lights so I added a big plane light right here on the side and this object has an emission material with a strength of 30 and also it just has a very light blue color just to give some natural light blue lighting and then also I added in this plane right here and this plane just has a subsurf modifier so that it is round and then I also gave this an emission material with a strength of 30 and it's shining down on the objects to just get some nice bright lighting and then also to get some really nice realistic lighting and reflections I added in an hdri so this is the Lopenheim 04 1k hdri this is a free hdri from polyhaven.com link is in the description if you'd like to download it so I downloaded the 1k version and the hdr version and then right here in the world settings you can click on the new button to add a new world and then right here on the color you can click on the yellow dot and you can choose environment texture and then just click on the open button and you can just add in the downloaded hdri and then to make it a little bit brighter I just turned the strength up to like a 1.5 so this will give some nice realistic lighting and reflections on the object now I am going to be using the displacements in the node editor to actually make the bark bump out and I would highly recommend that because it is really going to make the tree bark look much more realistic so right up here on the render properties you need to make sure this is set to cycles because the displacements in the node editor only work in the cycles rendering engine so make sure you're using cycles and then I am also going to be using the adaptive displacements so if you want to use the adaptive displacements you're going to need to change the feature set here to experimental and this is again right over here on the render properties so I'm going to change that to experimental so then right over here on the modifier properties I just added the subdivision surface modifier so you can click on add modifier and just add the subdivision surface and I added the subdivision surface modifier onto both of these objects and then because we set the feature set to experimental now that it's set to experimental right back here on the modifier properties we have the adaptive subdivision setting so I just turned that on and this way where you're closer up it's going to add more detail but then if you're farther away it'll add less detail so on this tree trunk object right here on the cylinder I turned on the adaptive subdivision and I just set the dicing scale to one I think that's pretty good and then on this object right here I turned on the adaptive subdivision and I just turned the dicing scale to five and that's just because this object is already pretty detailed that already has a lot of geometry so I didn't need to turn the detail up too high all right so now I'm going to click on this object and then right over here I have the shader editor so I'm going to click on new to add a new material and I can just rename this material to procedural tree bark and then I want this object to be on the other object so I can just click and drag and drag this material and drop it onto this object as well all right and then there is one more thing that we're going to need to do to get the displacements to work you need to go right over here to the material properties and then in the material properties you need to open up the settings tab so you can see right here on the displacement it just says bump only but I want to click on this and I want to change it to displacement and bump so this is going to tell the material that it can use the displacements so I can just make this smaller and we can start making the procedural material just one more thing though before we start I am going to be using the node wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes so if you don't have the node wrangler enabled you can just click right here on edit and then you can open up the preferences and then right over there on the add-ons tab you can go over to the search and you can search for node wrangler and just check mark the node wrangler add-on and I'll show you how to use it in the video so let's start by creating the base texture for the tree bark so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to go here to the search and I'm going to add a voronoi texture so you can just search for the voronoi and I'm going to add the voronoi texture and drop it here and then I want to preview it so I'm going to hold down the ctrl and shift key and select the voronoi texture that's using the feature from the node wrangler and it's going to preview that texture now I don't want this material to look like a bunch of little circles here or a bunch of little dots so I'm going to click on this drop down and I'm going to change this to the chebyshev and now by changing it to the chebyshev you can see that we have a bunch of squares and that is kind of what I want because if you've looked at bark materials it kind of looks like there's a bunch of squares or a bunch of rectangles but the rectangles are kind of scaled upwards or stretched upwards but then of course they're very natural and organic and random and they have a bunch of noise and they're kind of bumpy so this is what I'm going to use for the base of the texture and then also on the scale here I'm just going to turn the scale to like an 8 so it is smaller now also with the voronoi texture selected I'm going to press ctrl t and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping now I want to use the object coordinate so I'm going to take the object and we're going to plug that up to the vector now as I said earlier the main texture of tree bark seems to be stretched up so I want to use this mapping node to actually stretch the texture up so right here on the mapping node on the very bottom one right here on the scale I'm going to turn the z scale to just like a 0.2 and now you can see that all those squares are actually going up and down and that is starting to look a bit like tree bark of course it isn't very natural or organic it is very straight and so I want to add much more randomness and add more noise so what I can do is I can add another texture here in between the texture coordinate and the mapping to actually distort the voronoi texture so I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture and I'm just going to drop the noise texture right here between the texture coordinate and the mapping so it's going through the vector and so now the noise texture is actually distorting the displacement of the voronoi now I want to turn the detail all the way up to the max which is 15 so there's lots of detail and then I also want to turn the scale up to like 8 now there is a problem with this and that is that it's distorting it way too much so you can't even see those square shapes at all so what I want to do is make the effect less strong so I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the mix rgb and I'm just going to drop the mix rgb right here after the noise texture so I can now bring the noise texture down and then I want to take the object from the texture coordinate and I want to put that into color one so then this noise texture is going to go into color two and make sure you put the color into color two not the factor so now if I change the factor you can see it's going to change how much is being affected now I actually want to click on the mix here and I want to change the mix to the linear light so change it to linear light and now when I drag the factor you can see that the texture isn't being moved around as much and so we can actually kind of preview what it's doing better so if I turn this factor value all the way to zero it's just using the object coordinates but if I turn the factor all the way up to one it's just using the noise texture so I mostly want it to just use the object coordinates and I just want it to use the noise texture a little bit so I'm going to drag the factor way down and make it very small and I am going to be using a value of 0.08 so in the factor right there you can type in 0.08 and now if you look at that texture you can see that it is mostly keeping the shape it is keeping the shape of those squares or those rectangles but there's a little bit of noise here and there which is kind of distorting it so now it looks much more random and organic and we have a really cool texture here now right here on this noise texture we also have a roughness value and I do want to turn the roughness value up because if I turn it up it's going to add even more detail and roughness and I think it just makes it look more like bark but I don't want to just turn the roughness up evenly so that there's more roughness all over the place I want some parts to have more roughness and then other parts to have less roughness so I'm going to take the texture coordinate and bring it over and then I'm going to select this noise texture here and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and we're going to stick it down here so I can now take the object from the texture coordinate and I'm going to put that into the vector so I can now take the color from this noise texture and I'm going to put that into the roughness so this way instead of just evenly changing this with this factor value by using the color from this noise texture some parts are going to have more roughness and then other parts are going to have less roughness now on the scale here on this noise texture I'm just going to turn the scale to like a 3 and then I will leave the detail at the max which is 15 so it's very detailed now I want to have more control over this so to have more control over the colors I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the color ramp and we're going to stick the color ramp right here in between both of these noise textures so I now want to take the black tab and I'm going to drag the black tab out and I'm going to bring it out to about here and then I can take the white tab and I'm going to drag that over as well so now if I zoom in here you can see most of this doesn't have any roughness but then some parts here and there have lots of roughness now I don't want it to be that contrasty because that's very contrasty I do want to have some amount of roughness all over the texture so to do this I can click on the black tab and I can make the black tab lighter so I'm going to click on the color and I'm going to make this lighter and as I make it lighter you can see there's more and more roughness and if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using you can click on this tab and you can go here to the color and if you click over on the hex value you can type in b1 b1 b1 so that is the exact color that I'll be using and then I do want to take the white tab right here and I just want to make this white tab a little bit darker and again if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using right over here on the hex value you can type in ce ce ce so now if you zoom out here you can see some parts definitely have more roughness but then other parts have less roughness so it just makes the texture a bit more random and organic now I want to organize my nodes very well just so that they're very easy to understand so I'm going to be putting these nodes in a frame so I'm going to press b for the box select and I'm just going to box select all these nodes here but not the texture coordinate and not the principled so just all these nodes here in the middle I can now press ctrl j so ctrl j is going to join them together into a frame and then I can just kind of push them together just so that they're compacted a bit more so something like that maybe even bring these down a little bit so they're a bit more compacted all right so I can now click on the frame and I want to rename the frame I want to add a label so I'm going to press the f2 button and that is going to change the node label and I'm just going to rename this to like bark texture all right bark texture so that is the base of our bark texture so what I'm going to do now is take the distance from the voronoi and I'm going to plug this up to the base color of the principled and then I can also ctrl shift and select the principled bsdf and that is going to preview the shader now of course that doesn't look very much like bark because it is just black and white so I want to add a color ramp in here to change the different colors and make it look like bark so I'm going to press shift a and let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the color ram node and I'm going to stick the color ramp right here between the voronoi and the principled so I can now change the colors in here and that'll change the bark color so I'm going to click on this black tab right here and then I'm going to click on the color and for this first color I'm going to make this a very light color and then kind of a brown color so a very light brown and if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using you can go over to the hex value and you can punch in nine six seven seven five nine so that is the exact color that I'll be using and then I want to add a color in the middle so I'm going to hold down the ctrl key and click right in here and that is going to add another tab and then I want to bring this tab over a little bit so it's over here and then this one I'm going to click on the color and I'm going to make this a brown color as well so something like this and it's going to be a bit darker and again if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using over here on the hex you can punch in five nine three f two nine so that is the exact color that I'll be using and then for this last one here I want this to be brown as well so let's make this a brown color but this one is going to be very very dark and right over here on the hex value if you want to use the same color I'm going to be using a hex value of zero d zero nine zero five so just a very nice dark brown color and I'm also going to just drag the black tab over a little bit so that it's just a little bit more contrasty so now we have some really nice colors there for the bark now if you zoom in here you can see the bark is kind of shiny and I do want it to be pretty rough because bark is very rough so I'm going to take the distance from this voronoi texture and I'm going to plug a wire into the roughness and that way this texture here is going to control how rough it is now I want more control over this because I really don't have much control so I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for another color ramp and let's just stick the color ramp right in here between the voronoi and the roughness so just stick it right there so I can now change the colors of the color ramp and that's going to change how rough or shiny the actual bark is so if I make the colors lighter then it's going to be more rough so I can click on the black tab right here and I can make this brighter and brighter and you can see that now it is much more rough and if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using you can click on this tab right here and go to the color and I'm going to be using a hex value of b3 b3 b3 and then also right over here on this white tab over on the other side if you want to use the same color that I'm using you can go to the hex and you can punch in ed ed ed so this is basically just a white color but it's very very slightly gray so now you can see that tree bark is very rough and that looks much more realistic so the next thing that I want to create is the moss so I'm going to be creating the moss right up here so I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's stick the noise texture right up here and then I want to use the object coordinate so on the texture coordinate I'm going to take the object and let's put that into the vector and then I can ctrl shift and select the noise texture to preview it now on the scale I just want to turn this up to like a 7 and then I do also want to have lots of detail so let's turn the detail all the way to the max which is 15 and then I do want to add quite a bit of roughness so I'm going to turn the roughness up to like a 0.65 so a 0.65 and now that has a lot more detail and then I do think the moss looks pretty cool if it has a bit of distortion so on the distortion value I'm just going to turn this up to like a 0.3 so there's a little bit of distortion now what I want to do is create a mask to tell the texture where the moss is going to be so I need to make this more contrasty so to do this I can just press shift a let's go to the search and I can search for a color ramp and let's click on the color ramp and I'm just going to drop it right in here in this wire and just make sure you ctrl shift and select the color ramp to preview it so I can now bring these two tabs together and that is going to make it more contrasty so I'm going to drag this black tab to about here and then I'm going to drag the white tab out so that the actual white parts are brighter so just bring it to about there so wherever the white parts are that is where there's going to be moss so you can play around with this if you want very little moss you could just bring these over here and now there's not going to be very much moss or if you want a lot of moss you can drag this over so this way there would be a lot of moss I don't really want that much moss so I'm going to drag this over to about there so let's zoom out here and I want to join these together into a frame just to organize them very well so I'll press b for the box select I'm just going to box select these two nodes and then I can press ctrl j and ctrl j is going to join them together into a frame and then with this frame selected I can press f2 and that's going to bring up the node label and I'm just going to rename this to moss so just rename that to moss all right so I now want to add the moss into the base color so I can actually see it so to do this I want to mix this color ramp in with the color of the texture so I'm going to select this color ramp hold down the shift key and select this color ramp and then I can press ctrl 0 and that is using a feature from the node wrangler add-on and it's going to add a mix rgb so I'm just going to open up the mix rgb just click on the arrow to open it up and then I'm going to just box select these nodes right here and I'm just going to bring these nodes over so we have a bit more space so I actually want to take the color from the mix and I'm going to put that into the base color all right so then I want to ctrl shift and select this mix to preview it so right now you can see that it is adding the moss but the moss is all white so what I want to do instead is take the color ramp here from the moss and I want to put this into the factor and the factor is going to tell it what parts are going to be color 1 and then what parts are going to be color 2 so then we can take this color ramp here with the brown colors and I'm going to put that into color 1 so now color 2 is going to be the moss color because this color ramp right here is telling it where it's going to be moss and where it's going to be the bark so right back over here on color 2 I can just click on this color and I'm going to make this kind of a greenish brownish mossy color and if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using on color 2 you can go to the hex value and you can punch in 436c28 so that is the exact color that I'll be using so I can now ctrl shift and select the principled shader all right so this is definitely looking more like a bark material but it doesn't really have any bump it's very very smooth so I want to add some bump into the normal to make it look like it's bumpy so I want to add three layers of bump so the first layer of bump that I want to add is the voronoi texture because this is the actual bark texture so I'm going to take the distance from the voronoi and I'm going to pull out a wire and I'm going to stick that into the normal now there's some weird shading issues and that is because we need to convert this data into normal data because this is just black and white data but this actually needs to be normal data you can see that as a purple dot there so to convert this to normal data I can press shift a let's go to the search and I can search for the bump node and we're going to stick the bump node right here so then the distance can actually go into the height value of the bump and then the bump normal can go into the normal of the principled shader and this way it's going to convert it to normal data so now you can see that looks very bumpy and that looks really nice and also I can rename the bump node so if I click on the bump node to select it I can press f2 and I want to rename this to bark bump so just rename that to bark bump now this is a bit too strong and I want to make it a bit more subtle so let's turn the strength value on this bump node to just like a 0.35 I think a 0.35 is pretty good so now that's not quite as strong all right now I also just want to add some noise all over the texture just to make it look more organic and natural so I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search here and I'm going to search for a noise texture and we're just going to stick the noise texture right down here now I want to use the object coordinates so we're going to take the texture coordinate we're going to take the object let's pull out a wire and I'm going to drag this all the way over and we are going to plug this into the vector of the noise texture and then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it so let's take the scale here on the noise texture and I'm just going to turn that to like four and then I'm going to turn the detail here all the way up to the max which is 15 so it is very detailed and then I do want a little bit more roughness so let's turn the roughness up to like a 0.6 so it has even more detail all right so I now want to take this noise texture and I want to plug it into the bump just to give the entire texture a little bit of bump so I'm going to take this bark bump I'm going to take this node and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and I'm going to drop it right here so the normal can just go through the normal because it's already been converted to normal data from this one so we now have this extra height value that we can add data into so I'm going to take the factor from the noise texture and I'm going to plug that into the height and then I can control shift and select the principled shader to preview it so now it's just adding some procedural noise all over the texture now if I click on this bump node I can also press f2 to rename this and instead of it being bark bump I just want to rename it to a noise bump so now it says noise bump and then I do want to make it a bit more strong so on the strength value let's just turn this up to like a 0.4 so it's a bit more strong and actually if you control shift and select the different bump nodes you can actually preview what they're doing so that's what the first one is doing and then control shift and select this bump node and that's what the second one is doing now I want to add one more layer of bump and that's going to be the moss because if I control shift and select the principled shader if I zoom into the moss you can see the moss isn't really popping out but I do want the moss to look like it's bumping out so I'm going to take the color ramp here from the moss and I'm going to put that into the normal as well so let's take this bump node and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and I'm just going to drop it right here so again the normal can just go through the normal so we now have this extra height value that we can plug data into so I'm going to take the color from the color ramp and I'm going to bring this way down and I'm going to stick it right there into the height value and then if I click on this last bump right here I can press f2 to rename this and I don't want to rename it to noise bump I want to rename it to moss bump because it is the bump for the moss and then I do want it to be popping out quite a bit so I'm going to turn the strength value all the way up to one so now if you zoom in there the moss is popping out and that is looking very good so this is definitely looking like tree bark but there is one really important thing that I want to do here at the end and that is to add the displacements and this is really going to make it look like actual tree bark because it's actually going to be displacing the mesh so what I want to do is I want to take the bark texture and I want to put that into the displacement to actually displace the mesh so I can take the distance from the voronoi texture and I'm going to pull out a wire and I'm going to plug this into the displacement here on the material output now it's going to do something but you can see that that's really weird and that's all messed up it's like shooting out in a random direction and so that is because this is just black and white data but this needs to be displacement data so just like we did with the bump nodes I need a node in here to actually convert it to displacement data so to do this I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the displacement node and I want to drop the displacement node right here in this wire and then I can just drag this down and I'm going to stick this right down here underneath the principled and then also you can see that this wire is kind of overlapping so to make it not overlapping I can hold down the shift key and I can right click and drag and I'm going to drag a line over the wire and then let go and what that's going to do is going to add this little reroute and then I can just drag the reroute over this is optional you don't need to do it if you don't want to but I just want to organize my nodes very well so I'm going to bring that over and that way it's not overlapping all right now if I zoom in here you can see it's not really doing anything and that is because I actually need to take this wire and I want to put it into the height value instead so the voronoi texture from the bark texture needs to be going into the height value of the displacement and now you can see that is actually working so that is looking pretty cool but it is way too strong so I'm going to take the scale value and I'm going to turn this way down to like a 0.14 so just change it to like a 0.14 I think that is a good size we'll just wait for that to load up and there we have it so I'm just going to zoom into this object here make this a little bit bigger so you can see it's actually displacing the mesh and so that looks very cool and it really does look like procedural bark you can see those little bits there are kind of popping out here and there and it looks good from all sides so even if you look at this on the side of the cylinder or the back of the cylinder it has a really nice texture there and I really like how that is actually popping out of the mesh and that is it so that is the procedural tree bark material so I'll just give this a final render so I hope you found this tutorial helpful and thank you for watching and if

Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. All right, so let me just go over the 3D setup real quick. So I just modeled a very basic pickle material and I just kind of like added a cylinder and then extruded it out and then just kind of extruded it and scaled it down and filled some faces in there. And then also I wanted to preview the material on a sphere because I like previewing procedural materials on spheres. So I added an icosphere and subdivided it so it's nice and smooth. And then I just shaded these objects smooth. And then I also added a camera and pointed that right at the objects. And then for the lighting, I also added this plane right here. So this is just a plane with a subdivision surface modifier so that it is circular. And then on this plane, I gave it an emission material with a strength of 50 just to get some nice bright lighting on the objects. And then also to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections on the objects, I added in this Christmas Photo Studio 4 1K HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com and I just downloaded the 1K version and the HDR version. So link is in the description if you'd like to download it. So in the world, if you just add a new world, you can click on the color right here. Just click on the yellow dot and you can choose environment texture and then you can just click on the open button and open up the HDRI. Now I am going to be using the displacements in the node editor to make the little bumps on the pickles kind of pop out. So if you want to use the displacements like I'll be doing in this tutorial, then you will need to be using the cycles render engine. So make sure you're using cycles. And then I'm also going to be using the adaptive displacement. So if you want to use the adaptive displacement, you can set this to experimental here on the feature set. And this is right over here on the render properties. So then what I did is just selected these objects and I went right over here to the modifier properties. And right here I gave them a subdivision surface modifier and then I check marked the adaptive subdivision. And this way it's going to subdivide the mesh more where it's closer up and give it more detail. And so the displacement will have more geometry to work with. But then where it's farther away, it'll have less detail. And I also set the dicing scale to five. And then for this object right here, this object is pretty subdivided. So I didn't add any adaptive displacements. So I have the 3d view right here. And then I also have the shader editor right here. So I can just click on new to add a new material. And I can just rename this procedural pickle. Now we need to tell the material to use the displacements. So if you click right over here on the material properties, I'm going to open up the settings tab right here. And then I'm going to open up the surface tab. And then right here on the displacement, I want to change this to displacement and bump. And this is going to tell the material that it can use the displacements. And again, this will only work if you're using the cycles render engine. So I can now make this smaller. And let's create the material. One last thing, though, before I start with the material, I'm going to be using the node wrangler add on. So if you don't have that enabled, you can just click on Edit and open up the preferences. And then right over there on the add ons tab, you can search for node wrangler and just checkmark the node wrangler add on. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So when I was looking at reference images to create this pickle material, it seemed like all the pickles had kind of a gradient with the colors, because some side of the pickles were a bit more yellowish and a bit brighter, but then other parts were a bit more green and a bit darker. So let's add that gradient. So I'm going to start off by pressing Shift A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the gradient texture. And let's just drop it here. And then I also want to click and drag and drop this material onto this other object right here. Now we turned on the node wrangler add on. So with the node wrangler add on now turned on, I can control shift and then select different nodes. And that is going to preview the node on the objects, you can see what it's doing. So you can see we just have a very basic gradient. Now I want to change the colors of this gradient texture to make it look more like a pickle. So I'm going to press Shift A, let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And we're going to click on the color ramp. And I'm just going to drop it right here in this wire. So now we can change these colors here in the color ramp. And that'll change the colors of the gradient. So I'm going to take the white tab, and I'm going to drag it out a little bit. And then this one, I want to click on the color down here. And I'm going to make this kind of a yellowish color. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can go over to the hex value, and you can punch in a hex value of CCBC2D. So that's the exact yellow color that I'm going to be using. And then right here on the color ramp, I can hold down the Ctrl key and click. And that is going to add another tab. And then I'm going to drag this tab to about here. And I want to make this one a green color. So I'm going to click on the color right here. And I'm going to make this kind of a green color, not super green, and a little bit desaturated and a bit darker. And the hex value that I'm using for this color is going to be 5C6811. And then I want to make the dark color just a little bit stronger. So I'm going to just drag this out just a little bit. So now you can see we have a nice gradient here on the pickle. And I think I will just move this green one over just a little. So I want to organize my nodes very well, just so that it's easy for you to understand all the nodes and what they do. So I'm going to select the color ramp and then Shift select the gradient. I can then press Ctrl J and Ctrl J is going to add a frame, totally optional, you don't need to add the frames if you don't want to, they're just to organize the nodes. But then I can click on the frame. And I can press F2 to rename this and I'm just going to rename this to gradient. And then I can take the color and I'm going to plug that into the base color and then I can Ctrl Shift and select the principled shader to preview it. Now I want to create those little dots which are on the pickle because pickles usually have some little dark dots. So to do this, I'm going to bring the gradient texture up just a little bit. And then I'm going to press Shift A, let's go to the search. And to create the dots, I can search for a voronoi texture. And let's drop the voronoi down here. And then again, to preview it, I can Ctrl Shift and select the voronoi. Now you can see that there's a little bit of stretching. And I also want to just ensure that the voronoi texture is placed on the object very evenly. So with the voronoi texture selected, I can just press Ctrl T and Ctrl T is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And again, that's using the feature from the node wrangler. Now I don't need the mapping, the mapping is just used to change the location rotation scale the texture. But I can just click on the mapping and press x to delete it, I want to use the object coordinates. So let's take the object and I'm going to put that into the vector. And this way now you can see that the voronoi texture is placed on the objects more evenly. Now right here on this F1, I want to click on this. And I want to change this instead to smooth F1. And this way now you can see that there isn't those sharp areas and it's more smooth around the dots. Now I don't want it to be super smooth, I want to be a bit less smooth. So I'm going to turn this smoothness value to just like a point six, I can also drag this out so you can read the entire thing. And then I also want to have more dots. So I'm going to take the scale. And I'm going to turn this up to like a 9.5, just so that there are more dots. And you might need to play around with the scale value depending on the size of your object. Alright, now if you zoom in here, you can see the dots are very smooth and round. And I want them to be a little bit random and a little bit more natural and organic. So to do this, I'm going to put a noise texture in here to distort the placement of the voronoi. So I'm going to press shift a, let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's click on this noise texture. And I'm just going to drop this right here. So now the noise texture is changing the placement of the voronoi. Now I don't want to distort it this much because that is super distorted. So I'm going to bring the noise texture down. And then I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for a mix RGB. Let's just drop the mix RGB right in here between these two textures. Then I can take the object and I'm going to put the object into color one of the mix. And then the noise texture is going to go into color two. So now I can drag the factor. And if I turn it all the way down to zero, it's not using the noise at all. But if I turn it up all the way to one, it's using the noise completely. And then also you can see that this moves the texture around a lot. So to make this so it doesn't move it around as much, I'm going to click on the mix here. And I'm going to go down here and change this to a linear light. So now that that has changed to linear light, you can see that the texture isn't being moved around quite as much. And you can kind of see what is doing better. And I actually got this tip from a YouTube comment comment in one of my videos. So thank you to whoever let me know about this linear light. That's really awesome that it's not going to move the texture around. Now I don't want it to be very distorted because I mostly just want it to be those circular dots. So let's take the factor value and I'm going to turn this to a point zero five. And that weight is very subtle, but it is going to distort those dots a little bit and kind of give them some random shapes. Now I want to change the colors to make it look more like a pickle. So let's press shift day, I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Let's click on this color ramp and I can just drop it right in here in this wire after the Voronoi texture and then make sure you control shift and select the color ramp to preview it. So I'm going to click on the white tab and I'm going to drag this white tab over because I want it to be more contrasty. And that way you're just able to see those dots in some places. Because if I drag this over, you're able to see much more dark areas. But I just want to be able to see the dots in some areas. So I'm going to bring this over to about halfway. And then right now it is white, but I want to make it a pickle color. So let's take the white tab right here. And I'm going to change this to kind of a green color. And then I'm going to make it darker, so kind of a dark green, and not super saturated, so kind of a grayish greenish color. And the hex value that I'll be using for this color is going to be 555B15. So that is the color that I'll be using. And then I want to organize the nodes very well. So I'm going to press B for the box select. I'm just going to box select all of these four nodes here. And then again, I can press control J and that will join them together into a frame. And I can drag the texture coordinate up. We'll be using this for some other textures. And then I can kind of make this a bit smaller, kind of bring it up here. And then if you select the frame, you can press F2 to rename it. And I'm going to rename it to dots. So I can now hold down the control and shift key and select these different color ramps. So I want to mix them together because I want the pickle to have the gradient, but then I also want to mix it with the dots. So I'm going to select the color ramp, hold down the shift key and select the other color ramp. So they're both selected. I can now press control zero. Again, that's using the feature from the node wrangler, and it's going to add this mix RGB. So I can just click on this to open it up and kind of bring it up here. And then I'm going to control shift and select the mix to preview it. So now you can see that we are just blending between the two color ramps. Now I want to change the factor to like a point seven. And that way you can see those dots a little bit better. So now we have the gradients and the dots. So now just make sure that the color is going into the base color of the principled BSDF. And I can control shift and select the principle shader to preview it. Now this pickle color isn't very random. I want to give it more random noise to make it more organic and random and change up the variation of the colors a little bit. So I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's click on the noise texture and I'm just going to drop it right here. So right after this gradient, I can just bring it right there. Now I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And I again want to use the object coordinates so that it's placed on the object more evenly. So I'm going to take the object from the texture coordinate and I'm going to plug that in to the vector the noise texture. And then I also want to add a reroute in here because you can see that this wire is overlapping. So I'm going to hold down the shift key and then right click and drag with my mouse and just drag over the wire and then let go. And that is going to add a reroute and then I can just click and drag and drop the reroute here. Alright, so now I want to change the noise texture a little bit. So I'm going to turn the scale down to like a four. So the scale is a bit smaller, but then I do want to have lots of detail. So let's turn the detail all the way up to the max, which is 15. Alright, so we now have this noise texture here, but I want to plug this into the base color. So I'm going to click on this mix RGB right here, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it. And we're going to drop it right here after the first mix RGB. And I can bring these nodes back. Alright, so I now want to add the noise texture into this mix RGB here. So let's take the factor and I'm going to put that into the factor value of the mix. And then I can control shift and select this to preview it. And then I want this mix here to be going into color one. So now I can take color two, and I'm just going to set this to fully black. And you can now see that we have a really cool color map there for the pickle. And you can see the pickle has a bunch of noise there. So that's looking really cool. So I can control shift and select the principled shader. Now this pickle material is not very shiny and pickles are usually very wet and reflective. So I'm going to take the roughness value and I'm going to turn that way down. And you can see now the pickle is more shiny. But instead of just changing the roughness value right here, I want to add in a texture so that some parts are a bit more rough, and then other parts are a bit more shiny. So I'm going to take this color ramp here from the dots, I'm going to take the color, and I'm going to plug that into the roughness. Now I want to have more control over this because you can see it looks very shiny and it's reflecting the HDRI. So I'm going to press shift A, let's go to the search, and I can search for a color ramp. And we're just going to stick the color ramp in between this color ramp and the roughness. So I can now change the colors and that'll change how rough it is. So if I make the colors lighter, it's going to be more rough. So I can click on the black tab and I can turn this color up, and you can see as I turn it up, it's going to be more rough. And the hex value that I'll be using is a hex value of 595959. So by making it this gray color, you can see that it is pretty shiny, but it's not super shiny. So this is starting to look like a pickle material, but you can see that it's very smooth and it's not really bumpy. And so I want to add some data into the normal to give it some bump. So to do this, I'm going to press shift A, let's go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. I'm going to click on the noise texture and I can just drop it right here. Actually, I'll bring it down a little bit. And I want to use this noise texture just to give a little bit of bump all over the pickle to make it look more organic and natural. So let's take the object from the texture coordinate, and I'm going to plug that into the vector. And then again, you can see this is overlapping. This wire here is overlapping. So I want to add a reroute. So hold down the shift key, right click and drag over the wire and let go. That'll add the reroute. And then I can press G to grab or just click and drag and drop the reroute right down there. And then I want to control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So I want to turn the scale up quite a bit. So I'm going to turn the scale up to a value of 15. And then I also want to add lots of detail. So let's turn the detail all the way to the max, which is 15 as well. So there's lots of detail in there. So I now want to plug this noise texture into the normal. So take the factor, pull out a wire, and we're going to put that into the normal. And then I can control shift and select the principled shader. Now you can see there's some really weird shading issues. And that's because this is black and white data, it is a factor value. But then this is normal data, you can see it is a purple dot. So I need to convert the black and white data into normal data. So the principled shader can actually use it. So to do this, we're going to press shift a, let's go to the search, I'm going to search for a bump node. And we're going to put the bump node right in here between the noise texture and the principle. Now we want to take the factor value, and we actually want to put it into the height. And this way, it's going to convert it to normal data. So you can see the pickle looks very bumpy. Now it is way too bumpy right now. And I want to make it much less bumpy. So you can click on the strength value. And I'm going to turn this way down to like a point one, three. And that way, now if you zoom in here, there is definitely some bump, but it's much less strong. Now where those little dots are on the pickle, I want that to be bumping out. So we also are going to take this color ramp here from the dots. And we're also going to plug that into the normal. So let's click on the bump node. And I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it. And let's just drop it here. So I can take the normal and I can plug that into the normal right there. And this way, we can mix multiple bump maps together. So I can take this color ramp right here from the dots. And I'm going to take the color and I'm going to put that into the height value of the bump. And then if I turn the strength value up on the bump, you can see those dots look like they're going in. But instead of them going in, I want them to pop out. So I can click on the invert button. And now those dots look like they're popping out. And then they are way too strong. So I'm just going to turn the strength value to like point one here on this bump. So they're more subtle. Now I know that does look very, very subtle. But we're also going to be putting the dots in to the displacement to actually pop out the mesh. Now, if you don't want to use the displacement, you could turn the strength value up to make those dots look like they're popping out more. But I'm going to leave the strength value at just like a point one. Alright, so this is really starting to look like a pickle material. But I do want to give it some bump. So what I'm going to do is take this distance from the Voronoi texture, I'm going to take the distance and I'm going to drag this all the way over, you can kind of push and drag this over. And I'm going to stick this into the displacement on the material output. Now you can see it is displacing the mesh. But just like with these bump nodes, I want to add a node in here to convert this black and white data into displacement data. So I'm going to press Shift A, let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for the displacement node. And I'm going to drop the displacement node right here in this wire. And then I can just drag it down. And I'm going to stick it right here under the principal shader. Now you can see that something is still wrong, it's just kind of moving the pickle over. And that is because I need to take this wire and I'm going to put it up to the height value. So take the distance from the Voronoi texture and put that into the height value of the displacement. So now you can see it's working, but it's way too strong. So I'm going to turn the mid level to zero, I do think it looks better if the mid level is turned to zero. And then I can turn the scale way down to just like a point one. So now you can see that's much less strong. Now it's still not looking like a pickle that does look pretty cool. That is a pretty cool texture there. But it's not looking like a pickle because it's not bumpy in the areas where I want, I want to mostly be smooth, but just be bumpy in some areas. So to do this, I can add a color ramp and then I can sharpen up the values. So I'm going to press Shift A, let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And we're going to stick the color ramp right here before the displacement node. And I'm just going to bring the color ramp right down here. And then if you want to, you can select both of these nodes here. And then you can press Ctrl J, and that is going to add the frame here. And then I can press F2 with the frame selected. And I'm going to rename this to displacement. Alright, so now I can change the color ramp values. So I'm first going to take the black tab, and I'm going to click on the color. And I'm going to make this a bit more of a gray color. And the hex value that I'll be using for this gray color is going to be nine, six times. Alright, so now you can see it's a less strong because we've turned the color up. So you can see as I turn the color up, it's going to make the displacement less strong. Now I can also click on this white tab, and I'm going to drag the white tab over because I want it to be more contrasty. So you can see as I drag this over, now it is more contrasty because we are crushing these two values. So it's more contrasty. So now those dots are just in some places here and there. And that is exactly what I want. Now the dots are going back in. So if I take this color and make it darker, it's going to flip that. So then the bumps are going to be going out instead of going back in. So I can click on the white tab, click on the color here, and I can make this darker, and then it's going to flip it. So now as I make this darker, now you can see that those dots are popping out instead. And the hex value that I'll be using for this darker color is going to be 717171. And I'm going to kind of bring it over a little bit, just kind of stick it about there, kind of in the center. All right, so this is really looking like a pickle material. There is just one more thing that I want to do though to this material. I want to give this material some subsurface scattering, and that way it's going to allow a little bit of light to go through the pickle material. So if I go right over here to the subsurface on the principled, I can turn the subsurface up, and you can see even if I just turn it up a little bit, it's going to allow light to go through. Now right here, you can see there is a subsurface color. I'm going to click on this, and I want to make this a yellow color. And if you'd like to use the same subsurface scattering color, you can go right here to the subsurface color and go to the hex value, and I'm going to be using a value of E6B000. So it's pretty much a yellow color, a little bit darker, and then it's a little bit more towards the orange. So you can see now that's allowing a lot of light to go through, and it does make it look much more like food. Now the subsurface scattering is way too strong, so I can turn the subsurface scattering to a much smaller number, and now you can see it's not quite as strong. But there is one thing that I don't like about this. If I zoom in here, you can see those little dots are looking kind of red. And so what I want to do is make there be less subsurface scattering where the dots are, but then the rest of the pickle is going to have a little bit more subsurface scattering. So to do this, I can use the dots texture. So I'm going to take the color right here from the dots, and I'm going to plug that into the subsurface. So the subsurface right here on the principled shader. And then again, just like many of these other values, I want to have more control over it. So I'm actually going to take this color ramp right here from the roughness, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it, and I'm going to stick it right in here right before the subsurface. And you can kind of drag this out, kind of bring these nodes out of the way. So I can now change the colors here, and that is going to change where the subsurface. So if the color is white, there's going to be lots of subsurface scattering. But if the color is black, there isn't going to be any subsurface scattering. So I can control shift and select the color after preview it just to see what it's doing. And I'm going to click on this tab, and I'm going to make this tab fully black, because I don't want there to be any subsurface scattering where the dots are. And I'm also going to drag this out just a little bit to make the dots a bit more contrasty. And then I can drag this out and kind of crush those values to make this more contrasty as well. And I'm going to bring this to about here, so kind of in the middle, and you can see the position values that I'm using right here. So as I said, if the colors are lighter, there's going to be more subsurface scattering. But I don't want to have very much subsurface scattering, because if I control shift and select the principal shader, you can see that is way too much, it looks very yellow. So I'm going to click on this white tab, and I'm going to make it much darker. So as I make it darker, there's going to be less subsurface scattering. And I do want it to be pretty subtle, but I will make that a little bit brighter. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using, you can go to the hex and you can punch in 7E, 7E, 7E. So that is the lighter color that I'm going to be using for the subsurface here on this color ramp. So now if you look closely, you can see there is a little bit of subsurface scattering, but it is pretty subtle. And also where those dots are, there isn't really any subsurface scattering. So that is the procedural pickle material. So I'll just give this a final render. So I hope you enjoyed this blender tutorial, and thank you so much for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW9vH_qBN6Y,Procedural Beach Ball 🏖️ (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural beach ball material using the Cycles render engine for realistic results, while also noting its effectiveness in Eevee. The tutorial covers steps like creating colored stripes and circles using gradient textures, adding noise for realism, adjusting lighting for a beach-like atmosphere, and incorporating bump maps to simulate plastic texture. The video also mentions ways to support the creator through Patreon, Gumroad, and YouTube memberships, and includes a sponsor message for Sketchfab.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural beach ball material in Blender. And I will be creating this material in the Cycles render engine because I do want it to look very realistic, but this beach ball material also works really well in the Eevee rendering engine. So here it is in Eevee, and as you can see, it looks really nice in both Cycles and Eevee.

And then one last thing before we get started, I wanted to thank this video's sponsor, Sketchfab. Huge thanks to this video's sponsor, Sketchfab. On Sketchfab, you can upload, buy, and sell 3D models and assets. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can upload and preview your own 3D models in your browser. Sketchfab also has a 3D model store where you can purchase 3D models and assets. Check out Sketchfab with the link below. So let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So I just pressed Shift-A, and I went right down here and added an Icosphere. And then right behind me, if you open up the Add Icosphere settings, I just turned up the subdivisions pretty high, and then I shaded the object smooth so we just have a nice smooth Icosphere to preview the material on. But you could also just add a normal UV sphere. So here it is on just a regular UV sphere, and you can see that works really well as well. So you can pretty much add this material onto any spherical object. Now I wanted to make the lighting look like the beach ball was at the beach or maybe at a pool, and so what I did is I added these area lights. And these area lights are really strong at a power of 1000, and they're also very big. And then I also just gave them a bright blue color, and I pointed them on the sides of the beach ball, and that way it gives that nice bright blue rim light on the side of the object, and it kind of makes the beach ball look like it's at a pool or the beach. So I added one over on this side, and then I also added another one of these bright lights on this side, again to give some nice bright blue lighting. And then I also wanted to give a little reflection on the top of the beach ball, and so for this I added another area light, and for this one I set it to again a bright blue color, and I set the power to 500. So we get that little reflection right there on the beach ball. And then I also wanted to make it look like it was outside in outdoor lighting, so I also added this sunlight here, and I just turned the strength up to three and pointed it at the beach ball. And then to make it look very realistic, I also wanted some nice lighting and reflections. So right over here in the world properties, I added this Tiber Island 1K HDR, and this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, so the link is in the description if you'd like to download this. And I just added this HDRI into the world, and this way the HDRI will give some nice realistic reflections on the beach ball. And then I also just turned the strength down to like a 0.8, so it's not quite as bright. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial. So to enable the add-on, you can click on edit and go to the preferences, and then right over there in the add-ons tab, you can search for the Node Wrangler and just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on. Alright, so I have the 3D space right here, and I'm going to hold down the Z button, go up into the render preview, and then I'm just going to select this object, and I have the shader editor right here. So I'm just going to click on new to add a new material, and I can just rename this to procedural beach ball. So to start off, I want to make those little colored stripes going along the beach ball. So I'm going to press shift A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for the gradient texture, and let's drop the gradient texture right here. And then because we turned on the Node Wrangler, I can control shift and select the gradient texture to preview it. And then with the gradient texture selected, I'm going to also press ctrl T, and ctrl T is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I want to use the object coordinates, so let's take the object, and we're going to put that into the vector of the mapping. And then we are going to be using the mapping node to rotate the colored stripes around. Now the rotation of your gradient might look a bit different, and that's because I rotated the icosphere over just so that it looks better in the final render. If I press alt R, alt R is going to clear the rotation values, and you can see it just is going sideways. I'm going to press ctrl Z though to undo that, because I just rotated my object over. Now I want my stripes to be going from the top of the beach ball, and then going down to the bottom of the beach ball. So to get this effect, I'm going to click on linear, and I'm going to change this to a radial. So it's the very bottom one, radial. And now you can see what that's doing. So it's starting out black, and it's going from the top here, going all the way to the bottom, and it's starting out as black, and then the gradient slowly gets brighter and brighter as it goes around. And again, if the rotation is different, that's because if I press alt R, that's going to clear the rotation. But I just wanted to rotate my beach ball over, so that the top of the beach ball is kind of pointed out the camera. Now this isn't really the look of a beach ball. I want it to be very sharp, so where the stripes are, I want that to be a very bright color, and then the rest of the beach ball is going to be the white color. So what we need to do is press shift A. Let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. We're going to stick the color ramp right here after the gradient texture. So then what I can do is I can click on the linear, and I'm going to change this to constant instead. So now that it's set to constant, I can click on the white tab, and I can drag this, and you can see it's going to kind of change how big that pie shape is. So I can bring this closer and closer, and we're just going to make one of those stripes for the beach ball. Now I am going to be using a specific value, so if you click on this position value, if you click on the white one here, click on the position value, I'm going to be using a position value of 0.16. And then this black tab is going to be the color of the stripe. So for this first one, I'm going to make this a bright color, and I'm going to make it a blue color. Of course, you can make whatever colors you want for the beach ball. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using on this blue color, you can go over to the hex, and you can punch in a hex value of 007CFF. So that is the exact blue color that I'll be using. And then this other white color, I want to click on this and just make sure it is a fully white color. So right now we just have one stripe, but I want to have three stripes. And then between the stripes, it's just going to be a white color. And so this is where the mapping node comes in. So we can take this rotation z value, and we can rotate this, and that is going to rotate all the stripes. So we're just going to need to duplicate this and make two other stripes. We'll change the colors, and then we can just rotate them around, and then we'll just combine them together. So because this mapping node is really big, I'm going to click on the arrow, and the arrow is just going to make it smaller. And I can also click and drag and make this smaller as well. And I'll just kind of bring that down. All right, so I'm now going to press B for the box select, and I'm going to drag a box around all three of these nodes. I'm now going to press Ctrl Shift D. So normally Shift D is going to duplicate the nodes, but I want to press Ctrl Shift D. That's going to duplicate the nodes, but keep it plugged up to the object. And then I want to open up this mapping node so we can change it. And then I can also Ctrl Shift and select this color ramps that I can preview. All right, this next one is going to be a red color. Of course, you can change it to whatever color you want, but I'm going to be using a red color. So let's make this a very bright red. And the hex value that I'm going to be using for the red color is FF0A00. All right, so now if I Ctrl Shift and select this color ramp, you can see that one's blue. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select this color ramp. And you can see that that one's red. Now the problem with this is that they are both on top of each other. So I want to take the rotation Z value and I want to rotate this up. So to figure this out, we can do some simple math on a calculator. So I've just pulled up this calculator on my computer and 360 degrees is all the way around. So I'm going to type in 360. Now on the beach ball, we are going to have three different stripes, we're going to have a red one, a blue one, and a yellow one. And then next to each stripe, there's also going to be a white stripe. So I want to take the entire 360 degrees, and I want to divide this by three, and that is going to equal 120. So right here on this rotation Z value, I can just type in 120. And that is going to rotate it by the exact correct rotation. So now I can Ctrl Shift and select this color ramp, this one's down here. And I can Ctrl Shift, select this color ramp, and the red one is up here. And then in between there, we are going to have this white one, because on the color ramp, we brought this white one over. And so basically, there's going to be three different slices on the beach ball. And each slice is going to have a colored stripe and then a white stripe. So I can just minimize this mapping node just to make it smaller. So I'm going to do the same exact thing. So let's press the B for the box select, just box select these nodes, I can press Ctrl Shift D, Ctrl Shift D will duplicate the nodes, but keep the object plugged up. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select this color ramp. Now let's open up the mapping node. And this one, I want to rotate it over again. And so this one is already rotated over by 120. And so I just want to double that. So what I'm going to do is click on the 120. And I'm going to get rid of the D, the D is four degrees, what I'm going to do is hit the little star, the asterisk. And the asterisk is going to tell blender that we are timesing this number by another number. So I want to times this number by two. So I'm going to hit two and then enter. So now that is rotated over exactly by the correct degrees. Now right over here, if you click on this red one right here on the color ramp, I want to change this one to a bright yellow color. And for this one, the hex value that I'll be using is a hex value of FFBE 00. Alright, so I can Ctrl Shift and select each one. And you can see that they're all placed differently. And I'm also going to minimize the mapping just to make it smaller. So I now want to combine them all together. So I'm going to press B for the box select, just box select these nodes and just kind of bring them over, press G to grab and kind of bring them over. So we have a little bit more space. Alright, so I'm first going to add the blue and the red. So I'm going to select the blue color ramp, hold down the shift key and select the red color ramp, I can now press Ctrl zero, and Ctrl zero is going to add this mixed RGB. If you have the Node Wrangler turned on, it's going to add the mixed RGB and mix them both up. Now I just want to add the dark values, I don't want to add any of the white values. So on the mix here, I'm going to change this to darken. And then to preview it, I can Ctrl Shift and select the darken. So you can see it's starting to add that red. So we just need to take the factor and we need to turn that all the way to one. And so it's just going to add the color values. Alright, so now I just need to add the yellow. So let's select the darken, hold down the shift key, select the color ramp, and then I can press Ctrl zero, Ctrl zero, again, it's going to add this mixed RGB, let's bring this up, kind of move this over. And then again, I just want to add the dark values. So let's click on mix. And I'm going to change this to darken. And then on the factor, I can turn that all the way to one. So there we go, we now have some really cool stripes there for the beach ball. And then to organize the nodes very well, I'm going to press B for the box select, I'm just going to drag a box around all of these nodes here in the center. And then I can press Ctrl J, and Ctrl J is going to put all the nodes in a frame. This is totally optional, you don't need to do it if you don't want to. But I want to organize my nodes very well. So I'm going to put them all in a frame. And then I also want to rename the frame. So if I click on the frame, I can now press the N key and the N key is going to open up the side panel. Now if you click over here on node, you can change the label. So I'm going to rename this label to colored stripes. And then I can press N to close the side panel. Alright, so that is really cool. So let's take the color. And I'm going to put the color into the base color. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select the principled BSDF. Now to make this look much more like a beach ball, I want to make it very shiny because beach balls are made out of a shiny plastic. So on the roughness here on the principled, I'm going to turn this to like a point one five. And that way, it's going to be a very shiny plastic material. And then the plastic material is very thin. And so it is a bit see through. So I'm going to take the transmission value. And I'm going to turn this up to like a point three. So just turn up to like a point three. And this is going to allow a little bit of light to go through and it'll make it look more like plastic, especially if I go inside here, if I actually go inside the beach ball, you can see the HDRI lighting through the beach ball. So that's looking very cool. And also, if I move my perspective right over here, you can definitely see that and the reflections. So that really looks like a plastic beach ball, because you can definitely see that there's light going through the beach ball. So that's very cool. It should be very subtle. So that's why I'm just turning it to point three, but it's definitely going to add a lot more realism. So this is really starting to look like a beach ball. But we still need to add those circles on the very top and the very bottom. So let's do that next. So what I'm going to do is select this mapping, hold down the shift key and select the gradient and also hold down the shift key and select the color ramp because I'm going to be using these nodes. So let's press Ctrl Shift D Ctrl Shift D will duplicate them. Let's bring them up here and it'll keep the object plugged up. But then these I don't want them to be in the colored stripes. So I'm going to press Alt P and Alt P is going to take the selected nodes out of any frame and it's going to bring these up here and then I can Ctrl Shift and select the color ramp to preview it. Now to make these look like circles instead, I'm going to take the radial and I'm going to instead change this to linear and then I want to flip the color ramp values. So let's flip both of these values and I'm going to bring the white tab all the way over and then this blue one I'm going to bring almost all the way over kind of to about here and on this blue color I'm also going to make it fully black. Now if you navigate around you should be able to find that little circle there and if you drag this that's going to change the size of the circle. Now I want to rotate this circle around so that it is at the very top of the beach ball. So let's open up this mapping node and I'm just going to bring this up. So to rotate this onto the top of the beach ball I can rotate this y value. So on the y value right here on the rotation on the y I'm going to type in 90 because I want to rotate it exactly over by 90 degrees and now it's going to be on the top of the beach ball and again I rotate the beach ball over. If I press Alt R that will clear the rotation and you can see that at the top of the beach ball. But I just have the beach ball rotated over so I can now just click on this arrow to close this. So then right back over here on this color ramp you can drag this black tab and that is going to change the size of the circle but I'm going to use a specific position value. So I'm going to be using a position value of 0.963. So you can just type in 0.963 that is the size that I like or you can just kind of drag this around until it's the size that you like. So that is the first circle but I also want to have another circle on the very bottom. So we're going to do the same exact thing. So I'm going to press B for the box select just box select these nodes and let's press G to grab and I want to bring them up so there's some more space and then I can press Ctrl Shift D and let's bring these down. So now I can just use this mapping node to rotate it over to the other side. So I'm going to rotate to the other side here so I can see this and let's open up this mapping. So instead of it being rotated over by 90 degrees on the rotation Y I want to rotate it over by negative 90 degrees. So I'm going to type in negative 90 and then hit enter and then I need to Ctrl Shift and select the color ramp to preview it. So now you can see that that circle is on the other side. So we have one over here and one over there. So I now just want to combine them together. So let's first minimize this mapping to make it smaller. So I now want to mix these two together. So I'm going to select this color ramp hold down the shift key select the other color ramp and then I can press Ctrl 0. Ctrl 0 will add this mix and it's going to plug them both up. Now again I just want to add the dark values so let's click on the mix and I can change this to darken and then if you look over here you can see this one is kind of gray so I just need to turn the factor all the way up to one so it's adding all of the dark values. So now you can see we have those two circles there and then I'm going to press B for the box select. I'm going to box select all these nodes and I can press Ctrl J. Ctrl J is going to add a frame and then I'll bring this down and I can press the N key to open up the side panel and on the label here if you select the frame I can just rename this to circles and then I can press the N key to close that. So these are all the circle nodes. So I now want to add these circles into the color so I can select this darken hold down the shift key select this darken and then I can press Ctrl 0 again. Ctrl 0 is going to add this mix RGB and let's take the color and we're going to replace that into the base color and I can just bring this down. Now because these are just black and white values I can just use these as the factor. So let's take this darken the top one here from the circles and I'm going to put that into the factor and then this darken from the colored stripes is going to go into color 2. So now color 1 is going to be the color of the circle. So you can of course make this any color you want. I'm going to have this kind of a light blue and the hex value that I'll be using for this one on color 1 is going to be a hex value of 0397db. So you can see it's just kind of a light blue. So I can Ctrl Shift and select the principal BSDF to preview that and that is really starting to look like a beach ball. Now if you look at the color especially if you look at the white areas the white areas look very perfectly clean and they don't have any imperfections or anything. So to make it just a little bit more realistic I'm going to be adding a tiny little bit of noise in the color just to make it look like maybe it's a tiny little bit dirty or it just has a little bit of darker areas here and there. So I'm going to press Shift A. Let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's drop the noise texture right up here above the circles. And then right down here on the texture coordinate I'm going to pull out a wire from the object. You can just kind of drag over and kind of push your mouse into the corner that's going to bring it up and I'm going to stick it into the vector. And then just to organize the nodes very well I'm going to be adding a reroute in here. So I can hold down the Shift key and then I can right click and drag. I'm going to drag a line there and then let go. That's going to add a reroute. You could also just press Shift A and search for the reroute and then you can add a reroute and plug things up to it. So then I can take the reroute and I can just drag this over and then I can just kind of bring this down. And that way the wires aren't overlapping over anything. So on this noise texture I just want to make it more detailed. So let's turn the detail all the way up to the max which is 15. So I now just want to add this into the color as well. So I'm going to select the noise texture, hold down the Shift key, and select the mix. And then again I can press Control 0. That's going to add this mix RGB. And let's kind of drag this down. I can also box select these nodes and just kind of bring them up here. Now I want to take the noise texture and I actually want to plug this into the factor. And then I want to take this mix here and I want to put this into color 1. And then again I just want to add the dark values of the noise texture. So I can click on the mix here and I'm going to change this to darken. And then I can also Control Shift and select this darken to preview it. So now if you zoom in there you can see there's just a tiny little bit of noise and it is very subtle but it will make it more realistic. Now if you turn color 2 down to a darker value you're going to be able to see the noise texture better. And if you turn it up it's going to be invisible. So I just want to turn it down a little bit and that way you'll just be able to see that noise texture a tiny little bit. And the hex value that I'll be using for color 2 is going to be DB DB DB. So it is very subtle it is hard to see but if I Control Shift and select the principle shader it's just going to add a tiny little bit more realism because the colors aren't perfect. Now if you zoom up closely to the beach ball you can see the beach ball is also perfectly smooth and so I want to give it just a tiny little bit of bump. Now I don't want to add this noise texture into the bump so what I'm going to do is actually take this mix right here the one with the blue color and I'm going to take the color and I'm going to put that into the normal to give it some bump. Now we need to convert this to normal data because you can see there's some shading issues because this yellow dot here this is color data but then this purple dot right here this is normal data. So to convert it to normal data let's press Shift A I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for a bump node and we're going to stick the bump node right in here before the normal. And then to convert it to normal data I actually want to put the color into the height value. So now if you zoom in there if you look there on the edges it's just giving a tiny little bit of bump there on the seams and that's going to make it look just a little bit more realistic and it's going to make the different pieces of plastic look like they're kind of seamed together or melted together. Now if you look in the reflections it still looks very very smooth and I want to add just a tiny little bit of wrinkles and warping to the plastic. So I'm going to press Shift A let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's put the noise texture right down here and then again I can take the object and let's drag that and put it into the vector here on this noise texture and then so that the wire isn't overlapping I can hold down the Shift key and I can right click and drag and that's going to add the reroute. I can bring the reroute over so that it's organized very well and then I can Ctrl Shift and select this noise texture to preview it. Now for this noise texture I want to turn the scale just to like a three and then I do want to add just a little bit more detail but not very much so I'm going to turn the detail to a value of four and then I do just want to add a little bit of distortion to kind of make it look like it's warped a little bit and it's going to make it look like there are some wrinkles in the plastic. So let's turn the distortion value to like a 0.5. Alright so I can now mix this into the bump as well so let's click on this bump node and I'm going to press Shift D to duplicate it and I'm going to stick it right here after the first bump node and then I can take the factor and we're going to put the factor into the height value. So this way we can mix multiple bump maps together because the first one converts this to normal data and the normal goes to normal and then we can plug the factor into the next height. So I can Ctrl Shift and select this bump and you can see what it's doing. Now this is going to be way too strong if I Ctrl Shift and select the principal BSDF you can see that is way too strong so let's make this much more subtle. So I'm going to turn the strength value down to a 0.02 just a 0.02 and that way it's very hard to see but if you zoom in there especially in the reflections you can see that little bit of warping and that makes it look much more realistic and makes it look like the plastic is a little bit worn. Alright so I can zoom out there and take a look at the final thing. So I'll just give this a final render.

It guides viewers through setting up a scene with an icosphere, adding lighting, and incorporating an HDRI for realistic reflections. The tutorial covers creating three layers for the material: bumpy waves, sand particles, and rocks, using various textures and nodes. The instructor also explains how to enhance the material's appearance with adjustments to roughness and bump mapping. The tutorial concludes with an invitation to purchase the material or explore more content on the creator's Gumroad and Patreon pages.","In this tutorial I will show you how to create this procedural desert sand material in Blender. This material is available for purchase on my Gumroad store, and also my patrons over on my Patreon page get access to my procedural materials. And checking out my Gumroad store and Patreon page are great ways to help support me and this channel. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials, and after this tutorial if you'd like to learn how to create more procedural materials then you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. All of the links are in the description. So let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D scene. So I just pressed Shift A and I went here to Mesh and I added an icosphere, and then right here on the Add Icosphere Settings I just turned the subdivisions up really high to like a 6 so that we can preview the material on a smooth sphere, and I just shaded the object smooth. But you could of course add this material on a plane or a desert landscape or something like that. And then I also added a camera and pointed the camera right at the sphere. Now for the lighting I added in this plane light right here, so this is just a plane with a subsurf modifier so that it is round, and then I also gave it an emission material with a strength of 50, just so that we have some nice bright lighting shining on the sphere. And then to help get more realistic lighting and reflections I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDR, and this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, so the link is in the description if you'd like to download it. And right here in the World Properties I just clicked on the color, clicked on the yellow dot, added in the environment texture, and then opened up the HDRI. And again I downloaded the 1K HDR version. And then also I just turned the strength down to like a 0.8 so it's not quite as bright. And then to make the colors and lighting look very nice you can also go right over here to the render properties and under the color management you can set this to a filmic, and then I also set the look to very high contrast. And this will pop out the colors and make it more contrasty and saturated. And then I'm also going to be using the NodeWrangler add-on in this tutorial, so if you don't have that enabled you can click on edit and go to the preferences and then just click over on the add-ons tab and up there on the search you can search for the NodeWrangler and just check mark the NodeWrangler add-on. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. All right so just select your object and I'm going to click on new and I can click to rename this and I'm just going to rename it to procedural desert sand. So in this material we're going to have three different layers and we're going to combine them together. We're going to have a wave layer and that's just going to be some bumpy waves over the material. We're also going to have a sand layer so just like the little particles of sand and then we're also going to have a rock layer and then we're going to combine them all together. So let's do the wave layer first. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to go right here to the search and you can probably guess I'm going to be adding a wave texture. So let's click on this wave texture and I'm just going to drop it right here. And then we did turn on the NodeWrangler add-on so I'm going to hold down the ctrl and shift key and then left click to select the wave texture and it's going to preview that texture on our object. Now right here on the wave texture you have a setting to change the direction of the waves. So really you're just going to need to change this to whatever looks good for your object. I am going to be going with the z direction because that looks pretty good for my object because I have an icosphere and I'm looking at the icosphere from the front view. But maybe you're adding this onto a plane or some sort of flat object. The z one isn't going to work very well so for that you probably want to either use the y one or the x one. I would probably go with the y one so that the waves are going back and forth. So you'll just need to change this to whatever works best for your object. And then also on the wave texture I'm going to change the scale to like a 3.2. A 3.2 so that those waves are smaller. And then I also want to turn up this distortion value and that's going to make the waves more random. So I'm going to turn the distortion to like a 10. And then I want to add lots of detail to make it look very realistic and organic. So I'm going to turn the detail all the way to the max which is 15. And then I do also want to use the object coordinates. So with this wave texture selected I'm going to press ctrl t and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now I don't need the mapping nodes so I can just select it and press x to delete it. And then I actually want to use the object coordinates so let's take the object and we're going to put that into the vector. And the object coordinates will place the textures on the objects more evenly. So right now this wave texture is all over the object but that doesn't seem very realistic. I want it to be more random and so I just want there to be some waves here and there but I want some places to be more smooth. So what I'm going to do is mix this with a noise texture. So I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's just drop the noise texture right above the wave texture. And then I can ctrl shift and left click to select the noise texture and that's going to preview it. So let's take the object and we're going to put that into the vector as well. Now on the noise texture settings I'm going to turn the scale to like a 4 so it's a bit smaller but then I do want to add lots of detail so let's turn the detail all the way to the max which is 15. So what I'm doing with this noise texture is I'm creating a mask to make some parts smooth but then the other parts will have the waves. So in order for this mask to work I need it to be much more contrasty because right now it's very gray. So to make it more contrasty I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp node and let's put the color ramp node right here in this wire. So the noise texture factor will be going into the color ramp. So I can now drag these values together and that's going to make it more contrasty. So I'm going to drag this block tab over kind of to about here and then I can also drag this white tab over so now that is much more contrasty. So what we're going to do is we're going to make these black areas be smooth but then where the white areas are that is where the wave texture is actually going to show up. So now what I want to do is I want to mix the wave texture and the color ramp together. So I can select the wave texture hold down the shift key and select the color ramp. So I can now press ctrl 0 and ctrl 0 is going to add this mix rgb node. I can just bring the mix rgb back here and then I can open it up and also I'm going to press b for the box select. I'm just going to drag a box around these nodes and bring them back a little bit. All right so the mix rgb is now mixing the wave texture with this noise texture. Now this color ramp is black and white data so I actually want to pull it out of color one and I want to instead put it into the factor. So now I can take color one and I can make this fully white and so that way in some areas there's not going to be the waves. If I ctrl shift and select the color ramp you can see where those black areas are on the noise texture that is where there isn't any of those waves and where it's smooth. So now we have a really nice texture for our waves. Now right now it's just black and white and so I want to change the colors to make it look more like sand. So I'm going to press shift a let's click here on the search and I'm going to search for another color ramp. Let's click on this color ramp and I can just drop it right here and then also we need a little bit more space so I'm just going to box select these nodes and kind of bring them back a little bit. All right so now we can change the colors of this color ramp and that'll change the sand colors. Now the waves are a little bit hard to see so I'm actually going to take the black tab and I'm going to drag this black tab over so the waves are a bit more contrasty and then I can click on the black tab and I'm going to make this color kind of an orangey brownish color. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using for the waves you can click over on the hex value and you can punch in a hex value of b3 5b 37. So that is the color that I'm using for those waves. And then we also just need another base color for the sand so I'm going to click on this white tab click on this color and this one is kind of just going to be a peachy orangish yellow color. And again if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using over here on the hex value you can punch in ff b678. So now we have a really nice texture here for the waves of the sand and I can actually just take the color and we can put that into the base color on the principled and then I can ctrl shift and select the principled bsdf to preview it. All right so all of these nodes right here are the wave nodes so I want to organize my nodes very well and so I'm going to be putting all of these nodes in a frame. So I'm going to press the a key to make sure everything is deselected and then I can press b for the box select and I'm just going to box select all of these nodes but not the principled and not the material output and not the texture coordinate just these nodes right here. So now that they're selected I'm going to press ctrl j and ctrl j is going to put all of these nodes in a frame. Now I can also click on the frame and I'm going to press the n key and the n key is going to open up the side panel and if you click right here on node you can see that there is a name and a label for the frame so I can just rename this label to waves and now that I've renamed that you can see it says waves right there on the frame. So I can now press the n key to close the side panel. All right so that is the first layer so the next layer that we're going to be creating is the little particles of sand. So I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for the voronoi texture and let's drop this here and then just like all of the textures I want to use the object coordinates so let's take the object and we're going to put that into the vector and then I can ctrl shift and select the voronoi to preview it. So we're going to use all these little dots here to make it look like all the little pieces of sand. Now the little particles of sand are going to be very very small so let's take the scale value and I'm going to turn that to like a 500 just a 500 so now if you zoom way in there you can see there's just these tiny little bits of sand. Now these pieces of sand are actually very smooth and round and I want to make them much more rough and so I want to put another texture in between the texture coordinate and the voronoi so that it will distort the placement of the voronoi texture. So to do this let's press shift a I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture let's add a noise texture and I'm going to drop it right in here before the voronoi. So now this noise texture is distorting the placement of the voronoi texture and I'm going to zoom out here so we can see this a bit better. So I'm going to turn the scale on the noise texture to like a 10 and then I do want it to be very detailed so let's turn the detail all the way to the max which is 15. Now if I zoom way in here those don't even look like pieces of sand they're very very distorted and so I want to make the noise texture have less control over the distortion of the voronoi so I want to make it less strong. So to do this I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a mix rgb and let's drop this mix rgb right here between the noise texture and the voronoi. So I can now take the object coordinates from the texture coordinate we're going to pull out a wire from the object and I'm going to stick that into color one and then this noise texture is going to be going into color two. So now if I drag the factor value all the way to zero then it's not going to be distorting it at all but then if I drag the factor all the way to one it's going to be distorting it a lot. So I can just make this factor value very very small and that way the noise texture will just be distorting the voronoi texture just a little bit and I'm actually going to be typing in a specific value on the factor so I'm going to be using a factor of 0.03 so 0.03 and that way now it's just being distorted a little bit and it has a little bit of noise and then I do also want to give this just a little bit more roughness so on this noise texture let's turn the roughness up to just like a 0.6 and that looks a little bit better now you can see there's a bunch of little noise there in that sand. Alright so these three nodes are the particles of the sand so I now just want to add them all to a frame so I'm going to press the a key to make sure everything is deselected then I can press b for the box select and I'm just going to drag a box around these textures and then I can press ctrl j and ctrl j is going to add a frame let's just bring this frame over and then I can also press the n key to open up the side panel and on the label here I can just call this sand and then I can press the n key to close that. Alright so now we have two layers the waves and the sand there's just one more main layer that I want to create so I'm going to be adding it right up here and this is going to be the little rocks which are kind of popping out of the sand so I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to again search for a voronoi texture and let's drop it up here and then again I want to take the object coordinates from the texture coordinate and let's put that into the vector and then I can ctrl shift and select the voronoi texture to preview this now to make this look like rocks I'm going to click on the f1 and I'm going to change this to distance to edge and now you can see this kind of gives a texture of a bunch of little rocks now I want these rocks to be much smaller so let's turn the scale to like a value of 50 so that way the rocks are much smaller now I want to make these rocks more contrasty because they actually look kind of gray so let's press shift a I'm going to go to the search and let's search for a color ramp I'm going to add the color ramp and we're going to stick it right here after the voronoi texture so I can now click on this white tab and I can drag it over and as I drag it over it's going to make those rocks more contrasty and so it's going to make it whiter and so now those rocks are much more defined and they're much more bright in the center now I don't want the rocks to be all over the sand I just want a few little places here and there where the rocks are popping out but most of this texture is going to be the sand I just want a few rocks coming out here and there so to do this I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture let's click on the noise texture and drop it up here and then again I want to take the object from the texture coordinate and we're going to plug that into the vector of the noise texture and then I can ctrl shift and select the noise texture to preview it so on the scale here let's just change this to like a 20 change that to a value of 20 and then I do want to turn the detail all the way up to the max which is 15 so it's very detailed now I'm going to be using this noise texture as a mask just to tell the voronoi texture where it's actually going to show up so to make this a more effective mask I need to make it more contrasty so let's take this color ramp and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and we're going to drop it right up here and connect it up to that noise texture so I can now drag these values around and we're going to make it very contrasty so I'm actually going to drag the white tab kind of to about here and then I will drag the black tab over very close to it and so where the white areas are that is where the rocks are going to show up but then all the black area is just going to be where the sand is so I'm going to drag these very close together so now just some parts here and there will have the rocks so I now want to join these two color ramps together so I'm going to select the color ramp hold down the shift key select the other color ramp and then I'm going to press ctrl plus so ctrl plus is going to add a mix rgb and it's going to connect them up but it's automatically going to set the mix rgb to add and then this is the mask that we created so I want to actually take the top color ramp and we're going to put that into the factor and then color one right here I can just make this fully black so now if I zoom in there you can see the rocks are just showing up in a few places here and there so now I want to join these all together into a frame just to organize the nodes very well so press b for the box select just box select these nodes here these five nodes and I can press ctrl j and ctrl j will add the frame there and then I can click on the frame and let's press the n key to open up the side panel and on the label here I can just rename this to rocks and then I can press the n key again to close the side panel all right so we now have the rocks the waves and the sand so I want to combine them all together so let's just take these nodes and we're just going to bring them over to give a bit more space so I'm first going to be mixing the waves in the sand so I'm going to select the voronoi texture from the sand hold down the shift key and select the color ramp from the waves I can now press ctrl 0 and ctrl 0 is going to add this mix rgb I'll just click on the arrow to open it up and kind of bring it up here so it's mixing the waves in the sand together so let's ctrl shift and select this mix rgb to preview it now if I ctrl shift and select the voronoi texture from the sand you can see this is actually just black and white data and so I'm actually going to plug this into the factor so let's unplug this from color 2 and we're going to plug the voronoi texture up to the factor and then I want to take this color ramp from the waves and we're going to plug that one into color 2 and then make sure you ctrl shift and select this mix rgb to preview it so now I'm going to take color 1 and I'm going to make this the color for the little bits of sand so I'm going to make this kind of a reddish brownish color and make it a little bit darker and again if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using for those little bits of sand you can click on color 1 and I'm going to be using a hex value of bc6640 so that is the color that I'm going to be using for those little pieces of sand so now this texture has a lot more detail and it looks a lot more like sand so I can now ctrl shift and select the principled bsdf to preview that all right so I now want to mix the rocks in with this texture so I'm going to select the add from the rocks hold down the shift key and select the mix and then again I can press ctrl 0 and that is going to add a mix rgb I can just click on this to open it up and I can just drag it down here so that's going to add the mix rgb and it's going to plug them both up now I actually want to take this add right here and I want to plug this into the factor because this is just black and white data so I actually just want to use it as the factor and then I want to take this mix and we are going to plug this instead to color 1 so now if you zoom in here you can see that color 2 is going to be whatever you want the rock color to be so for color 2 for the rock color I'm going to make this kind of a reddish dark brownish color and if you want to use the same color that I'm using for the rocks you can click on color 2 you can go over to the hex value and you can use a hex value of seven three four three three one so now you can see that we have all those little rocks there on that material all right so this is looking pretty cool but I want to add some data into the roughness to make some parts a little bit more rough and some parts a little bit more shiny and then this also is very smooth and so I want to add some data into the normal to give it some bump so let's start by taking this color from the mix rgb and I'm going to plug that into the roughness now I want to have more control over this because if I zoom in there you can see the rocks actually look very shiny so I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp node let's click on the color ramp and I can just drop it right in here before the roughness and then I actually want to switch the values so let's click on this arrow right here and I can click on flip color ramp and that's going to switch them so now the black is over here and the white is over there so now if I kind of look at this on side view you can kind of see how the reflections are now this actually isn't very shiny and I do just want to make it a little bit more reflective so let's click on the white tab right here and I'm going to click on the color and I'm going to make this darker so if you make it darker it's going to be more and more shiny you can see there it's very reflective but I want it to be pretty rough so I'm just going to make this kind of a very bright color and the hex value that I'll be using for this white color is going to be d6 d6 d6 so now you can see it's just a little bit shiny but overall it is pretty rough all right so I now want to add some data into the normal to give it some bump so I'm actually going to be adding four layers of bump so the first layer of bump that I want to add is the waves so I want to make the waves look very bumpy so let's press shift a I'm going to go to the search and I want to search for a bump node and let's drop the bump node right here now we need this bump node to convert color data into normal data so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this mix here from the waves and I'm going to plug the color up to the height value and this way the bump node is going to convert this color data into normal data so I can now plug the normal into the normal on the principled so now you can see it's actually popping that out and that's looking really cool and you can also see some parts are wavy but then some parts are also very smooth now this is very strong so I'm going to take the strength value of the bump and I'm going to turn that down to like a 0.3 so it's much less strong and then to organize this better we can actually rename these nodes so if you select the node and then press the n key that's going to open up the side panel and if you click right here on node you can actually change the label right here so on the label I'm going to rename this to wave bump wave bump and then if you wanted to you could click on this color ramp right here and on the label I could just rename this to roughness you don't need to name them if you don't want to but just to organize these very well you can rename those if you want to all right so we now have the wave bump so I want to add some more layers of bump so the next layer of bump that I want to add is just some noise all over the material so I'm going to be using this noise texture right here so let's click on this wave bump and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and I'm going to drop it right here after this one so the normal can go through the normal so we now have this extra height value that we can add data into so right over here if you go to this noise texture I'm going to take the factor and I'm going to drag this over here and I'm going to put this into the height value of the second bump so now you can see this is just making a bunch of procedural noise all over the material and if you click on the wave bump you can change the label so I'm going to change this label to noise bump just to organize this very well so now I have the wave bump and the noise bump now this is a bit too strong so I'm going to take the strength value and just turn that to like a 0.2 so it's less strong and also I'm going to invert it you don't need to invert it if you don't want to but I think inverting it does look pretty nice all right so I now want to add another layer of bump and that is going to be the little tiny particles of sand so I'm going to click on this bump node and let's press shift d to duplicate it and just drop it right here and then let's go right over here and we're going to take the distance from this voronoi I'm going to pull out a wire drag over and I'm going to be putting it into the height value of this bump and then click on this bump node right here and this one I'm going to rename to sand bump all right sand bump and then I could also control shift and select the sand bump to preview it you can kind of zoom in there and you can see it's adding all these little bumps right there for the little bits of sand and then I do want to make this a little bit stronger so let's turn the strength value to like a 0.25 just a 0.25 and then I do want to leave the inverted on because if I uncheck the inverted it actually looks like those little bits of sand are going in but I want to leave the inverted on so that it looks like those little bits of sand are popping out all right so I now want to add one more layer of bump and that is going to be the rocks because I want the rocks to look like they're bumping out so let's click on the sand bump I can press shift d to duplicate it and let's just stick it right there so then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the add let's pull out a wire from the color from this add on the rocks and I'm going to drag way down and I'm going to put this into the height value of the sand bump just stick it right there and then to preview what that bump is doing I'm going to control shift and select the sand bump to preview it now it's still a little bit hard to see so I'm going to take the strength value and I'm going to turn that to like a point six so it's much more strong and also if you click on the sand bump on the label here I'm just going to rename this to rock bump and then I can also press the n key to close the side panel now if you zoom in there you can see it almost looks like the rocks are going in so I'm going to uncheck the invert from the rock bump and that way now the rocks look like they're popping out so now there's just some little rocks here and there so I can control shift and select the principle shader to preview it and let's also drag the material output back here now if you zoom in really close to the rocks you can see something is looking kind of weird you can see that the bump is actually bigger than the color of the rocks and so what I want to do is I want to make the bump more contrasty so that it's smaller and it doesn't go out quite as far so to do this I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp and we want to put the color ramp right here in this wire before it goes into the rock bump so just stick it right here then I can just bring it right down here so the ad is going to go through this color ramp before it goes into the rock bump so I can now click on the black tab and I can drag the black tab over and as I do that you can see it's making the bump of the rock smaller so I'm going to drag it all the way over to about there and now those rocks are much more sharp and they look a lot better all right so I can zoom out there and just make sure you control shift and select the principled bsdf to preview the final material so I'll just give this a final render so there we have it there is the procedural desert sand material so I hope you found

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWo3jZ0dPII,Procedural Baked Cheese Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural baked cheese material using Blender's cycles render engine for realistic rendering. The tutorial includes steps for creating and distorting textures, setting up lighting, and using displacement and subsurface scattering to achieve a lifelike cheese effect. The author also provides information on where to purchase the procedural material and other materials in their packs, and encourages viewers to explore additional tutorials on procedural materials available on their YouTube channel and Gumroad store.","In this blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural baked cheese material. This material was originally from my pizza slice blender tutorial series, so if you'd like to check out that tutorial series and learn how to create a pizza slice, I will have the links in the description. If you'd like to help support me as well as purchase this procedural material, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description. And if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials, you can also check out my blender procedural material packs. So they're packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with blender's procedural nodes. And every time I create another 10 procedural materials, then I add it to another procedural material pack. Link is in the description if you'd like to check those out, and purchasing the material packs is a great way to help support me and this channel. And if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, you can check out my blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. Again, link is in the description. Now I am going to be using the cycles render engine in this tutorial because I want to get a very realistic result, and I'm also going to be using the displacements in the node editor to displace the mesh, and I'm also going to be using the adaptive displacements. And then also, I am going to be using the geometry node right here, and I'm going to be using the pointiness value. And this pointiness value doesn't work in blender EV. So if you'd like to get the same procedural material result, then you should use cycles render. So in the 3d space here, I pressed shift a and I went to a mesh and then I added an icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click on that add icosphere setting and open that up, I'm just going to turn up the subdivisions here to a six, and then I will just shade this object smooth. So that's what I did for this object here, just that I have a nice subdivided icosphere to preview the material on. And then I also want to preview the material on like a melted cheese object. So what I did is I created this very basic melted cheese object. So to create this, I just pressed shift a and I went right here and added a cube. And then I kind of scaled the cube down and added some loop cuts to it. And then I selected some of the sides of the loop cuts and kind of pulled them around to create the different shapes. And then I also added a subdivision surface modifier to this object and just apply the subdivision surface modifier. And that way I have this nice baked melted cheese object to preview the material on. Now for the lighting, I added this circle right here. So I just press shift a and I went right down here and added a circle. And then I just filled a face here in the circle. And then I just kind of moved this right up here and pointed it down at the objects. And then I gave this circle and emission material with a strength of 200. And I gave it a slight yellow color just so that we have some nice bright lighting shining on the objects. And then also to help us get more realistic lighting right over here on the world properties, I added in this Skylit Garage 1K HDRI. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. So if you'd like to download this HDRI, I will have the link in the video description. So you can just add a new world and then you can click right here on this yellow dot next to the color. And you can choose environment texture and then you can open up the downloaded HDRI. So I'm now going to set up the settings to use the displacement. So to use the displacement, you need to go right up here to the render properties and you need to make sure this is set to cycles because the displacements in the node editor will not work in Blender Eevee. So make sure this is set to cycles. Then right here on the feature set, I am going to change this to experimental because I want to use the adaptive displacement. If you don't want to use the adaptive displacement, you can just leave this set to supported. But I'm going to change this to experimental and that way I can use the adaptive displacement. So where the camera is closer up to the object, it'll be more subdivided and have more detail. But then where it's farther away, it'll have less detail. So then right over here on the modifier properties, I'm going to give both of these objects subsurf modifiers. So I'm going to click on add modifier. Let's add the subdivision surface and then just check mark the adaptive subdivision if you want to use the adaptive subdivision. And I'll just leave the dicing scale at five. So then this object here, let's click on add modifier. I'm going to add the subdivision surface. And then I'm just going to check mark the adaptive subdivision. And I'll just set the dicing scale to five. Now there is one more setting that we need to do, we need to add a material and then tell the material that it can use the displacement. So in the shader editor, let's click on the new button right here. And I'm going to call this procedural baked cheese. Alright, so we've now created this material. And I'm also going to click right here and drag and drop this material onto this object as well. Now to tell it to use the displacement, we're going to go right over here to the material properties, I'm going to minimize these tabs. And I'm going to open up the settings right here. Now right down here under settings, if you go under surface, on the displacement, I want to click on this and I want to change it to displacement and bump. And so you're telling this material to use the displacement. Alright, so I'm not going to make this smaller. So we have more space. And I'll make the 3d view smaller as well. And I'm also going to hold down the Z button and go up into the rendered views, we can preview the material as we create it. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add on in this tutorial. So if you don't have that enabled, just click on edit, and then go to the preferences. And then click over on the add ons tab. And you can go to the search and search for the node wrangler and just checkmark the node wrangler add on. It's an add on built into Blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So let's press shift a now I'm going to go to the search here. So click on search. And I'm going to start by adding in a Voronoi. So I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture. And I'm just going to drop it right down here. Now because we turned on the node wrangler add on with the Voronoi texture selected, I can press Ctrl T and Ctrl T is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I don't need the mapping node because the mapping node is just used to transform the location, rotation and scale the texture. I don't need to do that. So I'm going to select the mapping and press x to delete it. But I do want to use the texture coordinate. So I'm going to plug the object up to the vector. And by using the object coordinates, it's going to place the texture on the objects more evenly. And then I can also hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and select different nodes. And that is again using a feature from the node wrangler. So when you Ctrl Shift and select different nodes, that is going to preview the node on the object. Now I want to distort this Voronoi texture and make it more noisy. So what I'm going to do is press Shift A, let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a noise texture, let's click on the noise texture. And then I can drop it in between the texture coordinate and the Voronoi. And that way the noise texture is actually going to distort the placement of the Voronoi texture. And then on the scale here, I'm just going to turn this down to like a two so that it is smaller. But then I do want lots of detail. So I'm going to turn the detail all the way up to the max, which is 15. Now it's distorting it a lot. And I only want to be distorting it a little bit. So I'm going to click on this noise texture, just make sure it's selected. And then I'm going to press Ctrl 0. And Ctrl 0 is going to add this MixRGB. So let's just open up the MixRGB. I'm going to bring the Voronoi texture over. And I want to plug the color into the vector. And then I want to bring this down. And then this factor from the noise texture is going to go into color 2. And I want to take the noise texture and bring it down here. So now what I'm going to do is take this object coordinates and I'm going to put that into color 1. So basically we are mixing the regular object coordinates with the distorted object coordinates. So I can now drag this back and forth. And you can see if I turn this all the way up to 1, it's going to be very distorted because it's being distorted by this noise texture. But if I turn the factor all the way down to 0, it's not being distorted at all. So I'm going to turn the factor to like a 0.4. And that way you can still kind of see that it is a Voronoi texture. It has those little circles there. But it is pretty noisy. And that also just makes it look much more organic and random. Now I want to make this a more contrasty texture. So I'm going to press Shift A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's click on this color ramp. And I'm going to stick it right in here after the Voronoi texture. So I can now start to drag these two values together, the black and white tabs here. And that's going to make it more contrasty. So now we've created this nice texture here where it's mostly white, but then there's some little black areas here and there. And we are going to use this as the cheese color to make some of the parts a little bit red, but then most of the cheese is just going to be a whitish yellowish color. Now this material setup is going to get a little bit big. And so I want to organize the entire material setup pretty well. So I'm going to be using frames to organize the nodes. So I'm going to press Shift A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a frame. Let's click on the frame and drop it here. Then I can press A to deselect everything. I'm going to press B for the box select. And I'm just going to drag a box around all of these nodes. So the color ramp, the Voronoi, the mix, and the noise. I'm now going to press G to grab and I'm going to drop my mouse right there in that frame and that is going to add them into the frame. So this is just a really nice way to organize nodes. Now I can also click on this frame and I'm going to press the N key and that is going to open up the side panel. And if you click on node here, I can actually label the frame. And I'm just going to label this frame to color because all of these nodes in here are going to affect the color of the material. So I can now press N to close that. Now I also want the edges of the cheese to look like they've been cooked and baked a bit more. And so I want the edges of the cheese to be more red. So I'm going to press shift A. I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for the geometry node. Let's click on this node and drop it right down here. Now I'm also going to press shift A. I'm going to go to the search here and I also want to search for a color ramp. Let's click on this color ramp and I'm going to drop it right in here in the frame as well. Now why we're adding a color ramp is because the pointiness value on default is not very contrasty. And so it's actually really hard to see. So I'm going to take the pointiness value and I'm going to plug that into the color ramp and then I can control shift and select the color ramp to preview it. And you can see here it is and it looks pretty much just gray and that is because it's not very contrasty. So I'm now going to start to drag these values together and as I drag them together it's going to be more and more contrasty. Now you can see with an object like this, this object is very smooth and so it just kind of looks gray. But for an object like this which is kind of bumpy you're able to see all that pointiness. So on the edges where it's the most pointy it is making it more white but then in the crevices and creases is making that more dark. And again if you're using Blender Eevee then you're not going to be able to use this because it doesn't work in Blender Eevee. You could bake out this texture to a texture map and then you could use it in Blender Eevee but then it wouldn't be procedural because it wouldn't be a procedural node it would be an actual image texture. And also something to note if you are in the material preview if you hold down the z button and go into the material preview that is pretty much just using Eevee to preview the material and so you're not going to be able to see it. So make sure you hold down the z button and go into the rendered view to preview the pointiness value. So I want these to be very contrasty so I'm going to drag these pretty close together. Now I'm going to make these be the cheese colors. So I'm going to click on the white tab and on this white tab right here I want to make this a red color because this is going to be where the cheese is kind of baked. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using if you click on this color here the red color if you go over to the hex value you can put in a hex value of e7 2b 0 0 that is the red color that I'll be using. And then I also want to make a light yellow color for the cheese so I'm going to click on the black tab and go here to the color. I'm going to make this pretty bright and I'm also going to make it kind of an orangish tannish color. And again if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using over here on the hex value you can type in f f d 0 7 3 so that's the color that I'll be using. And then I do want to be able to see a little bit more of the red so I'm going to drag the red over a bit so it's more contrasty. So you can especially see it there on the edges there is definitely more red and so it makes the cheese look like it's been cooked more or it's been baked more on the edges. All right so I now want to mix these two together because we have this right here which is going to be some red areas and then this right here which is the pointiness value. So I'm going to select this color ramp hold down the shift key and select the other color ramp. I can now press ctrl 0 and ctrl 0 is going to add this mix rgb and for some reason I added it way over here. Let's just drag this back over here and then I'm going to open it up. So it's added this mix rgb and then it's put these two color ramps together. So we're basically mixing these two together and also make sure you ctrl shift and select the mix rgb to preview it. Now this is just a black and white map so I actually want to take this color and I want to put it into the factor because we are going to use this texture right here to tell it where the red areas are going to be. So then this color ramp down here with the pointiness value that's going to go into color 1. So now color 2 is going to be wherever this texture is black. If I ctrl shift and select this color ramp you can see these little black areas that is where the color 1 is going to show up. So I can ctrl shift and select this mix rgb to preview it and I want to take color 1 and I'm going to make it a bright red color. And I actually want to use the same exact color as this red color here so I can actually just click and drag and I can drop this material into color 1. So now they are the same red color. So now you can see we have the pointiness value so some parts especially on the edges are kind of red but then we have little blobs here and there where the cheese may be bubbled up when it was being baked and it looks kind of red and cooked. Now I also want to add some little areas here and there of burnt cheese so I'm going to make that right up here and then we will add it into the color. So I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a voronoi texture. Let's click on the voronoi and I'm going to drop it here and then I want to take the object from this texture coordinate and let's plug that into the vector and then I can ctrl shift and select the voronoi texture. Now on the scale here I just want to turn this down to like a 4 and then I'm going to click on this setting right here and I'm going to change this to the chebyshev. Now again I want to use a noise texture to distort this voronoi texture so that it's more random and noisy and more organic. So I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture let's add a noise texture and I'm going to drop it right in here so it's going to be between the texture coordinate and the voronoi and that is going to distort it and then on the scale here I'm just going to turn this down to like a 4 but then I do want it to be very detailed so let's turn the detail all the way to the max which is 15. Now I want the burnt areas to just be in a few places here and there so we need to make this more contrasty so I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm again going to search for another color ramp node and we're going to put the color ramp node right here after the distance. So I can now start to drag these values together and that is going to make it more contrasty. So I'm going to drag this white tab like way over here and then I'm going to bring the black tab over a little bit as well. So now wherever those areas are black that is where the little burnt areas are going to be on the cheese. So I now want to add the burnt texture into the color so I'm going to take this mix here and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and drop it here and let's also bring these other nodes over a little bit so we have a bit more space. So I'm now going to take this color here from this mix and I'm going to put it into color 2 and then I want to take this color ramp and I'm going to put the color into the factor and then I can ctrl shift and select the mix to preview it. So because this color ramp is going into the factor that is going to tell it where it's going to be color 1 and where it's going to be color 2. So color 2 is going to be this mix right here and then color 1 is this color right here. So right now the color is red but I actually want to take color 1 and I'm going to make it fully black and that way now we've basically just added the burnt texture onto our color. So I can now take the color and let's put that into the base color and then I can ctrl shift and select the principled bsdf to preview that. Now I want to allow light through the cheese because the cheese is very warm and cooked so I'm going to be adding some subsurface scattering. So right here on this subsurface I'm going to turn this up to like a 0.5 and so this subsurface is going to allow light to go through the material and it'll make it look more soft and more like cheese. Now on the subsurface color I don't want this to be white I actually want it to be red. So I'm going to click on this color right here and I'm going to make this a bright red color and I do really like these red colors that I used for these other textures here. So I'm just going to click and drag and I'm going to drop this color into the subsurface color. So now the light that is going through is going to be red and you can see that is starting to look kind of like cheese. Now I want to change the roughness values to make the cheese more shiny. So what I'm going to do is take this noise texture from the color and I'm going to pull out a wire from the factor and I want to bring this all the way over and I want to put it into the roughness value of the principled. And so this noise texture is going to make some parts a little bit more shiny and other parts a little bit more rough. Now that's actually kind of rough and so I want to be able to have more control over this. So let's press shift a I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp and let's just drop the color ramp right in here before the roughness. So we can now play around with these colors and that will control the roughness. So if we make these colors darker they're going to be more shiny. So if I take this white tab right here if I click on this tab and if I make it darker you can see if it's darker it's going to be more shiny. So I just want to make it kind of a gray color something like that so it's pretty shiny. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using on this color ramp here to make it shiny then you can click over on this white tab and I'm going to be using a hex value of A7 A7 A7. So you can now see that that cheese looks pretty wet and shiny. Now this cheese is very smooth so I want to give it some normal to make it look bumpy and then I also want to add some data into the displacement to actually displace the mesh. So first let's do the normal. So what I'm going to do is actually take the noise texture factor right here I'm going to pull out a wire and I'm going to drag this all the way over here just push your mouse over you can push your mouse over and that's going to move it around and then I'm going to stick it right here into the normal. Now we need to convert this to normal data because this factor value right here this is just black and white data but this needs to be normal data you can see that as a purple dot so it needs to be normal data. So to convert the black and white data into normal data I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a bump node. Let's click on the bump node and I'm going to just drop it right in here in this wire and then we want the noise texture factor to be going into the height value and that way it's going to convert the black and white data into normal data. So you can see it goes in as a gray dot and it comes out as a purple dot because it is now normal data. So now if you zoom in there you can see that cheese is nice and bumpy. Now that strength value is pretty strong so I'm actually going to take the strength value and I'm just going to change that to like a 0.25 just like a 0.25 so now it is less bumpy but if you zoom in there you can see especially on the highlights it is definitely bumpy. Now if I control shift and select this voronoi texture I also want this voronoi texture to give it some bump and that way where those little bits are where the cheese is more red it's going to look like it's popping out a little bit. So I'm going to click on this bump node and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and I'm going to stick it right in here after this bump node. So the normal can go through the normal but we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So we're going to take the voronoi texture distance and we are going to plug that into the height value. So then I can control shift and select this bump node you can see that's what it's looking like so it's adding a bunch of little noise and then I can control shift and select this bump node and you can see it's giving it all those big areas of bump. Now I want to have more control over this so I'm going to press shift a I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Let's click on this color ramp and then I want to drop the color ramp right here in this wire going between the voronoi into the height of the second bump. So I'm going to drop it right there when that wire is highlighted and then I can actually bring this color ramp up and I can actually just stick it right here in this frame. So just stick it right there and then I'm going to click on this white tab right here and I'm going to drag the white tab over and as I drag the white tab over you can see that now those areas aren't quite as big because before they were like really really big so I want to drag this over and make them a bit smaller so that is looking much better. So I can now control shift and select the principled bsdf to preview that material. Now where those bigger areas are bumpy I don't want it to look like it's bumping in you can see that kind of looks like it's dented in I want to instead make it look like it's popping out. So I'm going to click on the invert button right here on this bump and that way instead of it looking like it's going in it now looks like it's coming out. Now I do want to add one more layer of bump those little areas right here where it's a really bright red those areas where it's burnt I want that to have some bump as well. So I'm going to click on this bump node I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and let's stick it right here after this bump. So again the normal can go through the normal and so I can now plug a value into the height value. So these nodes right up here this is the texture for the burnt areas and actually I could just add these into a frame to organize them better. I'm just going to press shift a I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for another frame let's just put the frame right here and then I can just drag and drop these nodes into this frame. So I'm just going to drag and drop them into the frame and then I'm going to bring the frame down and then I can also rename this so I'm going to press the n key that's going to open up the side panel you can click right over here on node and on the label right here I can just rename this to burnt because these are the burnt textures. So I can now press n to close that so if I control shift and select this color ramp that is the burnt map. So I can take the color from this burnt map and I'm going to plug it all the way right down here and put it into the height value of this bump. So then I can control shift and select this bump to preview it and then I do think it's a little bit too strong so on the strength value right here I'm just going to turn this down to like a 0.2 but now if you look up closely you can definitely see there's quite a bit of bump there on those burnt areas and then also on this bump node right here the one in the middle I think those are a little bit strong as well so on the strength value I'm just going to turn this down to like a 0.1 so just a 0.1 so I can now control shift and select the principled bsdf and we can preview that material. Now there is one more thing I want to do to this material I want to add a noise texture into the displacement to make it bumpy so I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's put the noise texture right down here we can just put it underneath this bump node and then I want it to use the object coordinates so on the texture coordinate I'm going to pull out a wire from the object I'm just going to push my mouse over on the corner that's just going to push it along and I'm going to stick it right in here into the vector the noise texture and again by using the object coordinates it's going to place the texture on the object more evenly and then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it so on this noise texture I'm going to turn the scale down to like a 2 and then I do want it to be very detailed so let's turn the detail all the way to the max which is 15. So I'm going to control shift and select the principled bsdf and then I can take the factor and we're going to plug the factor into the displacement on the material output. Now you can see this is totally messing up the mesh and that is because this is black and white data but this is displacement data so we need a node in here to convert this data into displacement data that the material can use so let's press shift a I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for the displacement node and we're going to drop the displacement node right in here into this wire and then I'm just going to bring the displacement node right over here underneath the principled. Now I want to take the factor and I actually want to plug that into the height value and that way it's going to convert the noise texture data into displacement data. Now it is way too strong so we need to take the scale value and we need to turn that down so I'm going to turn the scale value to like a 0.25 just a 0.25 and that way it's going to be a lot less strong but you can definitely see if I zoom in there on the edges it looks nice and bumpy and then just personal preference you can see that this wire is kind of going behind all of these wires and that just doesn't look very nice visually so I'm going to be adding a reroute in this wire so what I'm going to do is hold down the shift key and then I'm going to click and drag with my right mouse button and I'm just going to drag a line over there and then let go and that is going to add that reroute right there so I can just select the reroute and press g to grab and I can bring the reroute over and so now the wire is going down and then going over you can also just press shift a and you can search for a reroute and there's the reroute you can click on it and add it there and you could just like bring the reroute up here and I could just like stick the reroute right in there and that's going to connect it or I could also just like plug the object right up here into this reroute and then I could plug this one right up there into the vector so the reroute isn't actually going to change the look of the procedural material the reroute is just a nice way to organize the nodes so I'm going to add a reroute right up here and that way it's not going to be overlapping and then add a reroute right here and that way this wire is not going to be overlapping quite as much so I will just give this a final render so thank you so much for watching and I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and if you'd like to help support me and this channel you can also purchase this procedural material on my gumroad store and my patreon page I will have the links in the description and if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials you can also check out my blender procedural material packs and if you'd like to learn how to create more procedural materials you can check out my blender procedural material playlist on youtube all of the links are in the description and this material was originally created for my pizza slice blender tutorial so I will also have the link in the description if you'd like to watch that tutorial on how to create the slice of pizza but I hope you found this tutorial helpful and thank you for watching"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G01jRNtYzqI,Procedural Bubble Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a realistic procedural bubble material in Blender using the Cycles render engine, with an option to adapt it for Blender Eevee. The video provides step-by-step instructions on setting up the material, adding transparency, and creating a realistic effect using noise texture and bump mapping. The tutorial also covers compositing techniques for a nice background and denoising. Additionally, the creator offers resources for further learning and support through Gumroad and Patreon, and promotes Blender Grid as a rendering service. The tutorial aims to help viewers achieve realistic bubble materials and encourage support for the channel.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural bubble material in Blender. And I'm going to be creating this material in cycles because I want it to look very realistic, but if you want to do this in Blender Eevee, you can. So if you want to do it in Blender Eevee, you can totally use Eevee and just follow the tutorial. And then at the end of the tutorial, I will show you some different settings that you can turn on in Blender Eevee to get the transparency to work and to make it look a bit better in Blender Eevee. And here's the final result in cycles. And then here is the final result in Blender Eevee. So you can use whichever render engine you prefer. If you'd like to help support me and this channel, then you can purchase the tutorial files on my Gumroad store. And you can also get access to the tutorial files if you join my Patreon page. So the links are in the description to my Gumroad store and Patreon page. And those are both really great ways to help support me and this channel so I can continue to make more tutorials. And another great way to help support me and this channel is by checking out my Blender procedural material packs. So they're packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. Again, links in the description. And after this video, if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. Again, links in the description. And then just one more thing before we start. I wanted to give a huge thanks to this video's sponsor, Blender Grid. Blender Grid is an easy-to-use render firm specifically designed for Blender. I've used the service and I highly recommend it. Upload your Blender file or a zip file with the Blend file and textures. You can change the render settings on the website before rendering. Blender Grid will let you know the cost before you start the render. You can even choose when you want the render to finish if you're on a tight deadline. While it renders, you can check the rendered frames to make sure everything is rendering properly. Once it finishes, just download the files and compile the frames in a video editor. Use the link in the description to get $20 of render credit on your first render. All right, so before we get started with the procedural setup, I'm going to show you how I have the Blend file set up. So as I said, I'm going to be using the Cycles render engine, but if you want to use Eevee, you can. So if you want to use Eevee, you can just change the render engine to Eevee. And then at the end of the tutorial, I will show you some different settings that I would do to make it look better in Blender Eevee. So here in the 3D scene, I pressed Shift-A, and I went here to Mesh, and then I went right down here and added an Icosphere. Now right behind me, if you click on that little arrow, the Add Icosphere Settings, I turned these subdivisions up pretty high to like a six so that it is very detailed, and then I shaded the object smooth. So we just have a nice smooth Icosphere to preview the material on. And of course, that is also the shape of bubbles. So then I duplicated these bubbles, and I created three of them of different sizes. And then I added a camera, and I just placed the camera pointing at the bubbles. Now what's also very important is to get some very realistic lighting, because bubbles are transparent, and they're also very reflective. And so having a nice world HDRI in the background can really help to make them look more realistic. So right over here on the world properties, I added in this Suburban Park Area 1K HDR, and this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. So if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using, I'll have the links in the description. So over here on the world, I just added a new world. And then right here on the color, if you click on the yellow dot, you can change that to Environment Texture, and then you can click on the Open button and open up the downloaded HDRI. And again, I just downloaded the 1K HDR version of this HDRI. And then let me just go into rendered mode by holding down the Z button, moving up into the rendered view. So you can see this HDRI gives some really nice lighting. And then I did want it to be very bright, just that the soap bubbles have a lot to reflect. So I actually turned the strength of the HDRI up to a three, just so that it's very nice and bright. Now, if you want to, you can also make the background transparent. That's what I'm going to do. So I'm going to click right up here on the render properties, and then I'm going to go down here to the film tab and open this up. And I'm going to check mark the transparent button. And that way, the background is transparent. And then what I'm going to do in Blender's compositor is add just like a nice blue background. And I'll show you how to do that later in the video. Now, also right here on the color management, I'm going to open up the color management. And on the view transform, I'm going to make sure this is set to filmic. And then to make the lighting more contrasty and make the colors kind of pop out and look nicer, I'm going to change the look here to the very high contrast. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler add-on enabled, you can just click on edit, and then you can open up Blender's user preferences. And then if you go over there to the add-ons tab, you can just search for the Node Wrangler and just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. All right, so I'm just going to select one of the soap bubbles and click on new. And I can just rename this to procedural bubbles. And then I'm going to click right here, and I'm going to drag and drop this material onto these other bubbles. So to make these bubbles transparent right here on the default principal BSDF shader, I'm going to turn the transmission value all the way up to one. And now you can see they start to look kind of like a frosted glass. Now, I don't want there to be any roughness. So let's take the roughness value, and I'm going to turn it all the way down to zero. And already we're getting kind of like a glass shader by turning the transmission to one and the roughness to zero. Now, I want these bubbles to be much more transparent because right now they're actually not very transparent. Because right now this looks a lot more like glass, but I'm not creating a glass shader. I'm creating a soap bubble. So what I'm going to do is press Shift A. Let's go to the search here, and I'm going to search for the transparent BSDF shader. And let's just stick this right there. And then I want to mix the principled and the transparent together to make it more transparent. So to do this, let's press Shift A. I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for a mix shader. So this will allow us to mix two shaders together. So I'm going to drop this right here. And then I want to take the transparent, and I want to put that into the top one. And the principled is going to go into the bottom one. So now if I change the factor value, we can change this between just using the principled or just using the transparent. And of course, if we just use the transparent, you're not able to see it at all. Now I want some parts to be more transparent and some parts to be less transparent. So what I'm going to do is press Shift A, and I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for a layer weight node. So let's drop this right here above the transparent. Now we turned on the Node Wrangler add-on earlier in the video. So if I Control Shift and then select different nodes, that is going to preview the node. So if you Control Shift and select it multiple times, it's going to go down the different values and show you the different values. So I'm going to Control Shift and select this until we can preview the facing. So what this is doing is it's making the outer edges whiter, and then inside here in the center, it's making that darker. So instead of using this factor value, this is just a number value, I'm going to instead use this color data right here. So let's take the facing and we're going to put that into the factor. And then I can Control Shift and select the mix shader to preview it. So now you can see what's happening. If you zoom in over here, right here, it's a bit more reflective, and it looks a little bit more like glass, and it's kind of reflecting things more on the side. But then in the center, it is more transparent, and you're able to see through that better. And that is already making it look much more like a soap bubble. So on the edges, it's more reflective, and then inside, it's more transparent. And then also on this blend value right here, I want to turn this up a little bit to like a 0.6. So if I Control Shift and select the layer weight node twice, you can see what that's doing. So by turning it up to 0.6, the darker values are just a little bit less. So I can Control Shift and select the mix shader to preview it. Now, if you look right here in the center, you can see that it's very transparent, and I don't want it to be fully transparent. So I want to make those values a little bit less strong. So to control these values, I can press Shift A, I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's put the color ramp right in here between the layer weight and the mix shader. So I can now click on the black tab and I can start to turn this value up. And you can see as I turn it up, it's using less and less of the transparent, and it's using more and more of the principled. Now, I don't want it to be fully white, but I also don't want it to be fully black. I just want it to be using a little bit more of the principled shader. So I'm going to turn it up a little bit. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using, you can go over to the hex value and you can put in a hex value of 3d 3d 3d kind of fits the topic of this video because this is a 3d tutorial. And then also right here on the transparent color, make sure that is set to fully white, because if it is turned down, you can see the transparency isn't going to work. So make sure the transparent color is turned all the way to fully white. So this is starting to look a lot like soap bubbles. But if you've ever looked closely at a soap bubble, or looked at some images online, then you probably noticed that there are some little swirly random colors. And so let's add those colors. So I'm going to press shift day, I'm going to go to the search. And I'm going to search for a noise texture, let's just click on the noise texture and drop it down here. And then I can also Ctrl Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And I'm going to Ctrl Shift and select it twice. And that's going to bring us to the color one instead of the factor. So the factor is just black and white data. But this is one is actually color data, you can see that we have some random colors. Now I also want to use the object coordinates just that the noise texture is placed on the objects more evenly. So with the noise texture selected, I'm going to press Ctrl T and that is using another feature from the node wrangler, and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I don't need the mapping. So I can just select the mapping node and press the x key to delete it. And then I want to use the object coordinates. So let's plug the object up to the vector. Now on the noise texture on the scale here, I'm just going to turn this down to like a two. And then I do want the noise texture to be pretty detailed. So let's turn the detail level right here all the way up to the max, which is 15. So that is looking pretty good. But I do also want to add a little bit of swirls. So on this distortion value right here, I'm going to turn the distortion value up to like a three. And now you can see there are lots of little swirls there in that texture. So what I can do is I can take the color and let's put that into the base color of the principle. And then I can control shift and select the mix shader to preview that. And now if you look over here, especially on the sides where it is less transparent, you can see there's little random colors there. Now it's really hard to see and I do want to be able to see a little bit better. So to be able to see that better, let's press shift a I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for the hue saturation node. So we're going to take the hue saturation value node and we're going to put it right here after the noise texture. So then what we can do is we can turn up the saturation value, and that is going to make the colors more saturated. So I'll control shift and select the hue saturation value just so that you can see what it's doing. So if I turn the saturation value all the way up to like a two, now those colors are much more bright and saturated. So I can control shift and select the mix shader again. And you can see now those colors are much more visible. And that is looking much more like a soap bubble. Now when I was prepping for this tutorial, I was looking at reference images of like high quality, close up images of soap bubbles. And in the reference images, I could see just a tiny, tiny little bit of bump or normal on the soap bubble. So I am going to be adding just a tiny little bit of bump into the normal to just make it a little bit more realistic. So what I'm going to do is take the color value from the hue saturation value, and I'm just going to plug that into the normal. Now we need to convert this to normal data, you can see there's some weird shading issues. This is color data, but this needs to be normal data. So to convert this color data to normal data, let's press shift a, I'm going to go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a bump node, let's click on the bump node. And I'm just going to drop it right here between the hue saturation value and the normal. And then I can take this wire and I want to put it into the height value, that's going to convert it to normal data. Now this is like super, super bumpy. And of course, I don't want it to be that bumpy, I want to be very smooth. So we're going to turn the strength value way down. So I'm going to turn the strength value way down to a point zero one, so just a point zero one. So it's going to be very, very subtle, but I can just kind of zoom in here and wait for it to load up. And you can see there's just a tiny, tiny little bit of bump, and it just makes it look a tiny bit more realistic. So just giving a tiny little texture in there, it should be very subtle, though. So I will just give this a render. And then I'll show you what I did in blenders compositor to set up a nice background and add a D noise. Alright, so there we go, the render is finished. Now if you want to, you can head over to blenders compositor and you can do the same compositing settings that I did if you want to get a similar final render to the one that I got. So I'm going to hop right over here to the compositing tab, and then click on use nodes and then also make sure this backdrop is turned on. So because we turned on the node wrangler add on I can control shift and select the render layers and that is going to add the viewer node and we can preview those bubbles in the background. Now I want to add just kind of like a nice blue background in the background. So let's press shift A, I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for any ellipse mask. Let's just click on the ellipse mask and I'm going to drop it right here. So I can control shift and select the ellipse mask to preview it. And you can see what this is looking like. So you can change the width and the height values. And I'm going to change this and then after I change these values, I will blur it and change the colors and that way we'll have kind of like a basic gradient. So I'm just going to play around with these values and make these a bit bigger. Alright, so there we go. So I have the ellipse. Now I want to blur this. So I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a blur node. And let's just drop the blur node right here. Now I'm going to click and drag down on the x and y values. And I'm going to change this to a really big value like 700. This will also depend on like the resolution that you rendered your image, I rendered mine at 1920 by 1080. But then I set the resolution to 200. So it's pretty high quality. So just set the blur amount to whatever works well for you. Now this is just white and black, but I kind of want to make some blue colors. So I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp and let's just drop the color ramp right in here after the blur. So I can now just change both of these colors. So on the black tab, I'm going to make this like a very light blue color, something like that. And then on this white tab right here, I'm going to make this as well just like a very bright blue color, but this is going to be a bit more white and just wait for that to load up. And you can see we now have a really nice background there. So now I just want to mix the background with the bubbles. So to do this, I'll press shift a let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for an alpha over node. And let's just drop this right here. And then I'm going to make sure that the viewer and composite is both plugged up to the alpha over and then I can just take the render layers and we're going to plug that into the bottom alpha over and there we go. So it just took a moment to load up. But you can now see we have this really nice bright blue background in the background. Now I also want to add a D noise node just because the bubbles have a little bit of noise. So let's press shift a I'm going to go to the search. And I'm going to search for the D noise node. And let's just drop the D noise node right here into the composite and then bring the viewer over. We're just going to plug that up there. And then I'm going to just click on the accurate and I'm just going to change it to fast because I find that it is quite a bit faster, but it doesn't really affect the final result. And there we go. So there is the final compositing. So to save this image, you can press the F 11 key and that is going to take you back here to the image editor. And then I want to click on the drop down and I want to click on the viewer node and that is going to show us the final rendered image. So then to save this image, you can just click on image and click on save as and just save the image to your computer. Alright, so now for everyone who wants to do this in Blender Eevee, let me show you how to change this so that it works better for Blender Eevee. So I'm going to click back here on the shading tab and then I will hit the escape button. And I also want to drag this out. And then on the render engine right here, I'm going to change this to Blender Eevee. And when you change this to Blender Eevee, the transparency isn't going to work. So you're going to have to change some settings to get the transparency to work. Now, a few settings to make Eevee look a bit nicer. I want to turn on the ambient occlusion right here. So just checkmark that. And then I'm also going to turn on the screen space reflections. And if you open this up by clicking on the arrow, I'm also going to turn on the refraction. And those are all just little things which will make it look a bit more realistic. Now to make the transparency work, we need to click right over here on the material properties and just make sure you have the procedural bubble material selected. And then I'm going to go right down here and open up the settings tab. So under the settings on the blend mode, we want to change these both to alpha hash. So the blend mode to alpha hash and also the shadow mode to alpha hash as well. And it might take a moment to load up. But now if I zoom in there, you can see that was looking much more realistic. And we're actually able to see that transparency. So we're able to see through the bubbles. And then one more thing you could do to make it look a bit more realistic is you could click on the screen space refraction, just check mark that and I do think it helps to make it look a bit more realistic. And there we go. So there are the soap bubbles in Blender Eevee. So I'll just give this a final render. And there we have it. So there's the final render using Blender Eevee.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD2OvkAN15M,Procedural Dented Metal (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural dented metal material using various nodes and settings. The tutorial covers steps such as setting up the 3D view, using noise and Voronoi textures, and adjusting color ramps to create a realistic metallic look with dents and scratches. The creator also discusses ways to support the channel by purchasing project files on Gumroad, accessing materials via Patreon, or buying procedural material packs. Additionally, viewers are encouraged to explore more tutorials through a dedicated playlist, with all relevant links provided in the description.","In this blender tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural dented metal material. If you'd like to purchase this material, then I will have links in the description where you can purchase the project files on my Gumroad store, and you also get access to my procedural materials if you join my Patreon page. And checking out my Gumroad store and Patreon page are also great ways to help support me and this channel. And another great way to help support the channel is by checking out my blender procedural material packs. So I create packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes, and every time I create another 10 materials, I add them to a procedural material pack. So I'll have the links in the description where you can check out my procedural material packs on my Gumroad store, and that's also a great way to help support me and this channel. And if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then you can also check out my blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. Again, links in the description. So let me just show you how I set up my blender file. So what I did is I pressed shift a and I went here to mesh and I added an icosphere. And then right when you add the icosphere right behind me, you can open up the add icosphere settings. And I turned up the subdivisions really high to like a six so that I have a nice smooth sphere just to preview the material on. And then I also shaded the object smooth. And then to get some nice, bright lighting, I added in these two plane lights right here. So this is just a circle. And then this is just like a long plane. And I added a mission materials to them so that we get some nice, bright lighting on this object. And then because this material is made out of metal, it's going to be pretty reflective. And so to make it very realistic, it's good to have a nice HDRI lighting to get some nice, realistic lighting and reflections. So over here on the world, I added in this photo studio 01 1k HDRI. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. So if you'd like to use the same HDRI that I'm using, the link is in the description. And I just added this in as an environment texture here in the world. And then I'm also going to be using the node wrangler add on in this tutorial. So if you don't have that enabled, you can just click on edit, and then you can open up the preferences. And then right over here on the add ons tab, if you go over to the search, you can search for the node wrangler add on. And you can just checkmark the node wrangler add on. And I'll show you how to use it in the video. So you can just close the user preferences now. Alright, so I have the 3d view right here. And I am in the render preview. And then I have the shader nodes right over here. So I'm just going to click on new. And then I'm just going to rename this to procedural dented metal. Alright, so to start off, let's press Shift A, I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. So let's click on the noise texture and drop it right down here. And then because we turned on the node wrangler add on, I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and then select different nodes. And that is going to preview the node on the object. Now I also want to select the noise texture. And then with it selected, I'm going to press Ctrl T and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping, but we don't need the mapping because the mapping just changes the location, rotation and scale of the texture, I don't need to do that. So I'm going to select the mapping and press x to delete it. And let's take the object and I'm going to put that into the vector and the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly. So now I want to play around with the noise texture. So on the scale here, I'm going to change this to a four and then I want to be very detailed. So let's drag the detail all the way to the max, which is 15. So I can now take this factor value and I can plug the factor value into the base color of the principle. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select the principle to preview it. So now the noise texture is going to affect the base color. Now this doesn't look at all like metal. And that's because we need to turn up the metallic value. So we're going to take the metallic value and turn that all the way up to one. And it is now treated as a metallic material. And it does look quite a bit more like metal. We can also turn this roughness value down a bit and now it is more shiny. Now I don't want it to be this bright because this is very, very bright. So I want to edit the colors of the noise texture before it goes into the base color. So to do this, I'll press Shift A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. So let's click on the color ramp. And I'm going to drop it right in here between the noise texture and the principle. And then if you'd like to, you can Ctrl Shift and select it to preview it. So now we can change the colors in here. And that is going to affect the base color. So I can click on this white tab right here. Let's click on this color. And I'm going to bring this down and make it more gray because I want the middle to be a bit darker. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using on this gray value, if you go to the hex value, you can put in a hex value of six, six times. So that is the gray color that I'll be using. And then let's also click on this black tab right here. I don't want this to be fully black. So I'm going to click on the color and I'm going to make it a bit brighter, but it's still going to be pretty dark. And if you want to use the exact color that I'm using, you can go over to the hex value. And I'm going to type in a hex value of 2a, 2a, 2a. That's the exact color that I'll be using. And then I do want to make this a little bit more contrasty. So I can actually drag these tabs and you can see that it's going to be a bit more contrasty. And if I drag this further into the center, it's also going to get a bit brighter. So I'm just going to bring it to about there. So I can now control shift and select the principle of BSDF. And you can see, we now have a nice dark metal. Now I also want the roughness to be a little bit random because right now it's evenly rough all over the metal. So what I'm going to do is take the factor from the noise texture, and I'm going to plug that into the roughness value. So you can now see that some parts are more rough, whereas other parts are more shiny. Now I want to have more control over this. So let's press shift A. I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Let's click on the color ramp and I'm going to drop it right here between the noise texture and the roughness, and then just drag it over here under this color ramp. So we can now change the colors of the color ramp and that'll change how rough or shiny the metal is. So I'm going to click on the black tab and I'm going to drag it over a little bit. And you can see when I drag it over, it's going to be more and more shiny. Now I don't want it to be that shiny, but I do want it to be a bit more shiny. So I'll just drag this to kind of right there. So you can now see some parts are more rough, but then other parts are more shiny. And that is a pretty nice metal. Now the metal is still very smooth and it isn't bumpy at all. So I also want to take the noise texture and I want to plug that into the normal to give it some bump. So let's take the factor right here and I'm going to plug this into the normal. Now you can see there's some weird shading issues when we do that. And that is because we need to convert this to normal data because this factor value, this is just black and white data, but this needs to be normal data. You can see it as a purple dot. So we need to convert the black and white data into normal data. So to do this, I'm going to press shift day, let's go to the search and I'm going to search for a bump node and let's click on the bump node and I'm going to drop it right in here between the noise texture and the principled. And then we actually want to take the factor and we want to put that into the height value. So that is going to convert the black and white data into normal data. You can see it goes in as a gray dot, but then it comes out as a purple dot. And so that's actually data now that the principled shader can use. Now you can see it's very, very bumpy and that is like way too bumpy. So I want it to be much less bumpy. So on the strength value right here, I can just change this value to like a 0.1, just change it to a 0.1. And now if I zoom in there, you can see it as much less bumpy. It still is a little bit bumpy, but not too crazy. Now I also want to control this a little bit better. So I'm going to add a color ramp in here as well. So I'm going to take this color ramp right here, just select this color ramp and I'm going to press shift D and a shift D is going to duplicate the node and I'm going to stick it right here before the bump node. So stick it right there and I'm going to put it underneath these other color ramps. So I can now play around with this color ramp and that's going to affect the bump. So I'm going to drag this tab right over here and then I actually want to make it a little bit brighter. So let's take this color and I'm going to make it a bit brighter. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using over here on the hex value, you can type in a hex value of B3, B3, B3. So that is the exact color that I'll be using. And then I'm going to take this darker tab and I'm going to drag it over a little bit. And then if you want to use the exact color that I'll be using over here on the hex value, I'm going to be using a hex value of 4C, 4C, 4C. And I'll just drag this over a little bit farther. So now it's a little bit more contrasty. So now if I zoom in here, you can see some parts are just a little bit more smooth, like right there, but then some parts are a bit more rough, like right there. All right. So we now have a really nice basic metal material. Now I want to make dented metal. And so I want to add more values into the bump here to make it look like it's dented. So to do this, I'm going to press shift A. I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for a voronoi texture. So you can type in VOR and then add the voronoi texture. And I'm going to drop the voronoi texture right down here under the noise texture. And then to preview it, I can control shift and select the voronoi texture. And then I want to use the object coordinates as well. So let's take the object and we're going to put that into the vector of the voronoi. So we're going to use all these little dots here on the voronoi texture to make the metal kind of bumpy and look like it's been dented. So right here on the voronoi texture settings, I'm going to click on the F1 and I'm going to change this to smooth F1. And that way you can see that it's much more smooth there between those dots. Now I don't want it to be super smooth. I just want it to be a little bit smooth. So let's turn this smoothness value down. And I actually want to change the smoothness value to a 0.3. So now it is pretty smooth, but not super, super smooth. So I now want to take this voronoi texture and I want to plug it into the normal as well to give it some bump. So we can actually mix different bump maps together. So I can take this bump node, just select it, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it. And we're going to drop it right here after this bump node. So this bump node has already converted the noise texture into bump data. So now the normal can just go through the normal, but we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So let's take the distance value from the voronoi and we're going to plug a wire into the height value. So now we are mixing multiple bump maps together. So I can control shift and select this bump node. You can zoom in and see what it's doing. And then I can control shift and select this bump node. And you can see that it's making all these little dents along the metal. Now I want this bump node to be a little bit stronger. So on the strength value right here, I'm just going to change this to like a 0.15. And that way it's a little bit stronger. Now you could have the dents going in. If you like that, I'm going to control shift and select the principal BSDF. Just drag this material output right back here. You could do that if you wanted to. And that way it's going to make the dents going in, but I want it to look a little bit more lumpy. So I'm actually going to hit the invert button. And that way now those dents are actually kind of coming out in the middle, but then they're kind of dented and going back in there on the sides. So really just personal preference. You could invert it if you want to. I am going to turn on the invert, but you don't have to if you like it better without the invert. All right. So that looks much more dented now, but I also want to give some little scratches all over the metal just to make it look like it's more worn. So let's take this noise texture and I'm going to press control shift D. So normally if you press shift D, that will duplicate the node. But if you press control shift D, that's going to duplicate the node, but it's going to keep the wires plugged up to it. And I'm going to bring the texture coordinate down. So the object is going into the vector. And then to preview this noise texture, I'm going to control shift and select it to preview it. All right. So now we can change the noise texture settings. So I'm going to leave the scale at four and the detail to 15. I do want to add a little bit more roughness though. So let's turn the roughness value to like a 0.6. So now it has a bit more roughness. Now I want to make this look like scratches. So how we can do that is we can turn up this distortion value. So you can see as I turn up the distortion value, it has all these little swirls here. So I'm going to turn the distortion value to a value of four. And now you can see it has all these little swirls. Now I don't want there to be scratches all over the place. I want to make it more contrasty. So we're going to be using another color ramp node to make it more contrasty. So I can actually take this color ramp right here, the one in the middle, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it. And we're going to stick it right here after this noise texture, just put it right there. And then the viewer node is already plugged up to it so we can preview what it's doing. So I'm going to bring this right over here and then I can drag this over and then I can take the white tab and I can drag it over. So this way it's going to be much more contrasty. And I want to be able to see those black areas better. So let's drag this black tab over as well. And now you can see that it's very contrasty and I want to bring them even closer together. So I'll bring the white tab over and the black tab over just kind of to about here. So now we have all these little scratches and they're very detailed. If you zoom in there, you can see there's a lot of detail. So I now want to plug this into the normal as well. So let's click on this bump node. I'm just going to bring it over and then I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and we're going to drop it right in here between these two bump nodes. So just drop it right there and that's going to plug it up. So the normal can just go through the normal and then this normal can go through the normal. But we now have another height value right here that we can add data into. So let's take this color from the color ramp and we're going to put that into the height value. And then to preview it, I can control shift and select it to preview it. Now if I zoom in here, you can see because we have the invert turned on, those scratches are actually popping out. But I instead want them to be going back into the metal. So I'm going to uncheck the invert and that way now they look like they're going back in. And then I don't want them to be very strong. So let's turn the strength value down just to like a point one. So now you can see there's all these little scratches. And if I go right up here and control shift and select the principal BSDF, kind of zoom out here, you can now see that there's little scratches here and there. So like right there, you can see there's some little scratches there. And there's some subtle scratches right around there. So that just makes the metal look more worn out. Alright, now I want to add one more layer of dents. I want to add some chunky dents. I want to make it almost look like someone took a hammer and kind of hit the metal at different angles and kind of make it look like there were some chunky dents into the metal. So to get this effect, I'm going to click on this noise texture and I'm going to press control shift D that will duplicate it with the node plugged up and I'm going to put the Voronoi texture right down there. And let's just bring the texture coordinate down and then I can control shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. So to get the effect that I'm going for, I'm going to click on the smooth F1 and I'm going to change this to F2. And when I change that to F2, you can see the texture that it's giving us and we can use this to create those dents. Now you can see that this Voronoi texture is pretty smooth and those lines are very smooth. And so I want to use another texture to distort the Voronoi texture. So let's click on this noise texture and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and we're going to stick it right here before the Voronoi texture. So this way the object coordinates from the texture coordinate is going through the noise texture and that is going to distort the vector. So basically this noise texture is distorting the placement of the Voronoi texture and you can see now it looks much more random. Now I don't want it to be quite that random because that's pretty crazy. So I'm going to press shift A, I'm going to go to the search and let's search for a mix RGB node and I'm going to drop the mix RGB node right here after the noise texture. So this noise texture right here is going to go into color 2, but then we want the original object texture coordinates to be going into color 1. So now I can just play around with this factor to either use the noise texture or just the normal object coordinates. So if I turn it up all the way to 1, now you can see it's using that noise texture completely and that is super distorted. But if I turn the factor all the way to 0, now it looks very smooth. So I just want to turn this up a little bit just so that it's slightly noisy. So let's turn the factor value to like a 0.2 and then let's also take the roughness here on this noise texture and I'm going to turn it down to like a 0.5 so it doesn't quite have as much roughness. And then on this Voronoi texture here, I also want to make this a bit bigger, so let's turn the scale right here up to like a value of 11 so that's bigger. And this factor value right here, I want this to be set to a 0.2. I think a 0.2 looks pretty good. Now you can see that this still looks pretty distorted and that is because there is this distortion value turned up on the noise texture. So let's turn this distortion value all the way to 0 so it's not very distorted. So now if I zoom in here, you can see it's really keeping the shape of the Voronoi texture much better. You can see if I turn the factor all the way to 0, now that is just using the object coordinates. But then if I turn this up to just like a 0.2, now it's just adding a tiny little bit of noise on the Voronoi texture. Alright, now I want to make this more contrasty as well. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Let's click on the color ramp and I can drop it right here after the Voronoi texture. And then to make it more contrasty, I'm just going to take the white tab and I'm going to drag this way over so it's more contrasty. If I drag this back over here and made it not as contrasty, there would be tons of dents all over the place. But I just want there to be a few dents here and there, so I'm going to drag this over and that's going to make it more contrasty. So there's just a few dents here and there. So now I want to add this into the bump as well. So let's take this bump node and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it and let's just drop it right here after that bump node. And then what we want to do is we want to take this color ramp, we want to take the color, and let's put that into the height value to convert it to normal data. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select this bump node to preview it. Now if I zoom in here, you can see that it looks like those dents are actually popping out and so I need to turn off the invert and that way now you can see those dents there look like they're going in. And then I do want to make them just a little bit stronger, so let's turn this strength value to like a 0.2 so it's just a little bit stronger. Alright, so now I can Ctrl-Shift and select the principled BSDF and we can preview that material. And one more thing that I want to do, I don't know why this happened again, but the factor is at 0.1 and I want to change the factor on the mix here to a 0.2. So now if I zoom in there, you can see those look more distorted. If I turn this all the way down, you can see it just looks like these little like moon shapes or kind of like eyes. I want to take the factor and I want to turn that to a 0.2 and that way it is much more distorted. Alright, so there we have it. So there is the finished procedural dented metal. So I'll just give this a final render now. So that's going to be it for this tutorial. Thank you so much for watching and I hope you enjoyed the tutorial.

If you'd like to help support me as well as purchase this material, then you can get the project files for this tutorial on my Gumroad store, and all of my patrons over on my Patreon page also get access to my procedural materials.

And if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. Again, links are in the description. Now I am going to be using the displacements in the node just to give a little bit of random bumpiness and lumpiness to this orange, because oranges aren't perfectly smooth and perfectly round. They are just a little bit bumpy and each one kind of has a slightly different random shape. And so to use the displacements in the node editor, you will need to be using the cycles render engine. Now this is totally optional. You don't have to use the displacements in the node editor. If you don't want to, you could just model a basic orange 3d model and then add this material on to the orange. And this procedural material also does work pretty well in Blender Eevee. You can see here is the material in Blender Eevee, and I think it looks pretty nice as well. I'm going to be using cycles though, because I want to use the displacement and it also just looks a bit more realistic in cycles. So let me just show you what I have set up in the 3d space. So I just pressed shift a and I went right down here to mesh and I added an icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click and open up the add icosphere settings, I just turned the subdivisions up to like a six. And that way we have a very nice subdivided icosphere and it's very round and smooth. And also because I am going to be using the displacements, this will give more geometry so that it can displace the mess just a little. And then to get some nice, realistic lighting over here on the world, I added in this fails or forest is zero one, one K HDRI. And this is from polyhaven.com. So links in the description, if you'd like to use the same HDRI that I'm using, and that'll just help to give some nice, realistic lighting for this material. And then also to get some nice, bright lighting, kind of shining on the object, I added this plane here. So this is just a plane with a subsurf modifier so that it is circular. And then I gave it an emission material with a strength of 30. And if you're using blender Eevee, the emission isn't actually going to emit light because that only works in cycles. So if you're using blender Eevee, I would just press shift day. And instead of using that plane light, I would just add like an area light. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add-on in this tutorial. So if you don't have the node wrangler add-on enabled, you can just click on edit and then open up the preferences and then just head over to the add-ons tab and then search for the node wrangler. And then you can just check mark the node wrangler add-on. So I have the 3d space right here and I am in the rendered view. And then I have the shader nodes right here. So I'm just going to click on new to add a new material. And I'm just going to rename this material to procedural orange peel. So to start off, let's press shift day. I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture. Let's just drop the Voronoi texture right here. And then using the feature from the node wrangler, you can just hold down the control and shift key and then select different nodes. And that is going to preview the node. It's going to use this viewer node right here, and it's going to preview the node on our object so we can actually see what it's looking like. And then with this Voronoi texture still selected, I'm going to press control T and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping behind the Voronoi. Now I don't really need the mapping node because the mapping node is just used to transform like the location rotation and scale the texture, but I don't need to do that. So I'm going to click on the mapping node and then I will press X to delete it. And then I want to use the object coordinates. So I'm going to plug the object up to the vector on the Voronoi and the object coordinates is going to place the Voronoi texture on the objects more evenly. So what we're doing right now is we're creating the base color for our shader. And so if you look closely at orange peel, it has little tiny colored dots and the colors are kind of orangey and yellowish. So what I want to do is I want to click on the F1 and I'm going to instead change this to smooth F1. And that way the edges are going to be more smooth, you can see there's this smoothness value. So we can make those edges more smooth. Now I'm going to turn it this smooth and his value to like a point three on the Voronoi texture. And then also on the scale here, I'm going to turn the scale up to like a 75. So there are much more of those little dots. So we're going to use this as the base color on the orange peel. Now these colors aren't really what I want, this is just black and white. And I want to instead make some orangey colors and some yellow colors. So I'm going to press Shift A, let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for a color ramp node. And let's just drop the color ramp node right in here. So the distance from the Voronoi is going to go into the color ramp. And then I can take the color and I can plug that into the base color of the principled. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select the principled BSDF to preview that. So now let's change the colors by changing the color. So I'm going to click on the white color right here. And then I'm going to click on this color. And I'm going to make this kind of a yellowy orangish color, it's going to be pretty bright. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, then you can go over to the hex value. And you can punch in a hex value of FF7D00. That is the exact color that I'll be using. And then let's click on the block tab right here. And this one is going to be very bright, and it's going to be a very similar color, but it's going to be a little bit more towards the red. And the color that I'll be using for this one is a hex value of FF6400. So if you Ctrl Shift and then select the color ramp, you can preview that color. So if I zoom in there, you can see it kind of looks a little bit yellowish. And then it has those orange dots. And that's exactly what I want for the color. So I'm just going to Ctrl Shift and select the principal BSDF again. Now I want to allow just a little bit of light to be going through the orange peel, it is pretty shiny, but I just want to add a little bit of subsurface. And that'll just allow a little bit of light to go through the orange peel. So I'm going to turn the subsurface value to just like a point zero five, so very small, just a point zero five. Now right now, it's just kind of making the orange peel look a bit lighter. And that is because of this subsurface color, if you make this bigger, you can see it says subsurface color. So we can just change this. So I'm going to click on the white tab, and I'm going to make it very bright. And then I'm going to make it kind of like an orangey red color. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using on the subsurface color, if you go to the hex value, I'm going to be using a hex value of E seven, two E zero zero. And now you can see that that subsurface is just making it look slightly more red. So now I want to give the orange peel texture some bump. So I'm going to click on the Voronoi texture, and I'm going to press Ctrl Shift D. So Shift D will duplicate nodes. But if you press Ctrl Shift D, that is going to duplicate the node, but it's going to keep everything plugged up to the node. Now why I'm duplicating this is because I want to change the size of the Voronoi texture. Because if I Ctrl Shift and then select this Voronoi texture, you can see that's pretty small. But for the normal of the orange peel, I don't want the bumps to be that small, because that's pretty small. So I'm going to use a separate Voronoi texture for the normal. So I will just Ctrl Shift and select the Voronoi texture. So on the scale here, I'm going to instead change it from 75 to just like 37. So I think 37 is a much better size. Alright, so now what I want to do is I want to take this texture, and I want to put it into the normal to give it some fake bump. So let's take the distance value, and I'm going to plug that into the normal. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select the principled BSDF. Now we're having some shading issues, and that is because this is black and white data. You can see it is a gray dot, but then this normal here is purple, and that is normal data. So we need to convert this black and white data into normal data. So to convert this, I'm going to press Shift A, I'm going to go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a bump node. So let's click on the bump node, and we're going to add the bump node right in here. So what we want to do is actually plug the distance into the height value. So the gray is going to go into the gray, and then the bump node is going to actually convert this to normal data. So then the normal can go into the normal of the principled BSDF. And now you can see that that is actually looking like it is popping out of the mesh. Now it's way too strong right now, so on the strength value, I'm just going to turn this way down to like a 0.08, just a 0.08. So it's much more subtle now, but you can definitely still see that taking effect. Now I also want this voronoi texture to control the roughness. So let's take the distance, and I'm going to put that into the roughness. And that way some parts will be a little bit more rough, and other parts will be a little bit more shiny. And you can see that taking effect right there. Now I want more control over the roughness, so I'm going to press Shift A. Let's go to the search here, and again I'm going to search for a color ramp. So let's click on this color ramp, and I'm going to drop it right in here between the voronoi and the roughness. So we can now play around with these colors, and that's going to change how rough it is. So I'm going to click on this white one right here, and I'm going to click on the color, and I'm going to make this one a bit darker. And if I make the value darker, you can see it's going to be more shiny. Now I don't want it to be that shiny, so I'm going to turn this up a bit. But if you make the values darker, it's going to be more shiny. And if you make it lighter, it's going to be more rough. Now if you want to use the exact same color value that I'm going to be using, I'm going to be using a hex value of C8 C8 C8. And you can see now that is a bit more shiny, and that looks good because oranges are pretty shiny. And then on the block tab, I want to change this as well. So I'm going to click on the block tab, click right here on the color, and I'm going to make this a bit brighter. And the hex value that I'll be using for this one is 3 3 3 3 3 3. So just add six threes. So there we go. That is the exact color that I'll be using. So now that orange is pretty shiny, and I think it does look pretty nice. Alright, now I want to add just a little bit of noise all over the orange peel. So what I'm going to do is press Shift A. Let's go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's click on the noise texture, and I'm just going to drop it right down here under the Voronoi. And then just like all of these other textures, I do want to use the object coordinates. So let's take the object, and we're just going to plug that into the vector of the noise texture. And then to preview what the noise texture is looking like, just Ctrl Shift and select the noise texture, and we can see that on the model. So I'm going to turn the scale for this one up to like a 10. And then I also want to turn the detail here all the way up to the max, which is 15. So now I want to take this texture, and I want to plug this texture into the bump. So what I can do is I can actually add multiple bump maps together. So I'm going to click on this bump node, and I'm going to press Shift D. Shift D will duplicate the bump node, and I'm going to drop it right here after this bump node. So the normal can just go through the normal on the bump node, but we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So I can take the factor from this noise texture, and we are going to plug that into the height value of the bump. And then I can just Ctrl Shift and select the bump node to preview it. So if you Ctrl Shift and then select the first bump node, you can see that's what it's looking like. And then you can Ctrl Shift and select the second bump node, and you can see what that noise texture is doing. Now I think this is actually just slightly too strong, and I do want it to be pretty subtle. So on the second bump node, the one which the noise texture is going into, I'm just going to turn the strength value down to like a 0.06. So it's just slightly less strong. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select the principal BSDF to preview that. Now an orange peel material does have a bunch of little tiny bumps along the orange peel surface. And if you zoom in there, you can definitely see that because we are using this Voronoi texture into this bump. But I do just want to give it a little bit more bump. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this bump node right here, and I'm going to press Shift D to duplicate it. And let's just drop it right here one more time. So now what I want to do is I want to take this Voronoi texture again. We're going to take the distance, and we're going to plug that into the height of this bump. Now you might be wondering why I'm adding another one because we already have this one. So it's kind of pointless to add another one. But this one, I'm going to make a little bit more contrasty. So the distance from this Voronoi is going to go into the height value of this bump. But then to make it just a little bit more contrasty, I'm going to press Shift A. Let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. So let's click on the color ramp and then just move the color ramp until that wire is highlighted. And then just click right there to You could also just bring it down and then take this Voronoi, take the distance, and plug that into the factor. And then the color ramp color is going to go into the height value. So now I can Control Shift and select this color ramp. And we are basically just going to make it more contrasty. So to make it more contrasty, I'm just going to click on the white tab, and I'm going to drag it much closer to the black tab. So I'm just going to bring it to right about there. So you can now see that as much more contrasty. Whereas before, if I Control Shift and select this Voronoi texture, you can see that as much less contrasty. But then if I Control Shift and select the color ramp, now it's more contrasty. And so those little dots are much smaller. So now I can Control Shift and select the bump node, we can preview what it's doing. So if you select the bump node, you can then press M and M is the shortcut key to mute a node. So we've muted the node and now it's gray. And so you're not able to see it anymore. So you can see that's how it looks like before. But then if I press the M key again, with this bump node selected, you can see that's what it's doing. So there's the difference. So it's just adding a little bit more bump right in the center of where those little dots are. So I'm now just going to Control Shift and select the principled BSDF to preview that. So we are almost done with this material. But I do just want to give a tiny little bit of displacement in the displacement here in the material output. And that way, it's just going to make this orange 3d model just slightly bumpy, you don't have to do this, if you don't want to, you could just model a orange 3d model, but I'm just going to give it a tiny little bit of bump so that it's not perfectly round, and it's not perfectly smooth. Now there is one thing that we need to do to get the displacement to work. So I'm going to open up this side panel right here. And I'm going to go over to the material properties. Now, as I said, at the beginning of this tutorial, if you want to use the displacements in the node editor, they're going to need to use the cycles render engine, because the node editor displacements will not work in Blender Eevee. So if you're using Blender Eevee, then you can just skip this part, but I'm using cycles. So I'm going to use the displacements. So I'm just going to scroll down right here. And this is on the material properties. And I'm going to open up the settings tab right here. And on the displacement right now, it's set to bump only, but I'm going to instead change it to displacement and bump. And that way, we are telling the material that it can use the displacement so I can just make this smaller to get it out of the way. Alright, so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this noise texture, and I'm going to press Ctrl Shift D to duplicate that, but keep the wire plugged up. And I'm just going to stick it right down there. Now this noise texture is going to be used to control the displacement. Now I want to make the scale much smaller because if I Ctrl Shift and select this noise texture, you can see that scale is much too big. And I just want to give it a tiny little bit of bumpiness here and there. So on this scale value, I'm going to turn this way down to like a 0.8. So just a 0.8. And now that is very subtle. But you can see some parts are a little bit darker, and some parts are a little bit lighter. So just like with these bump nodes, we converted color data or black and white data into normal data. And so I need to do the same thing for the displacement. Because this right here, this noise texture, this is black and white data. But this is not going to work with the displacement because we need to actually convert it first to displacement data. So to convert it to displacement data, I'm going to press Shift A. Let's go to the search here, and I'm going to search for the displacement node. And I'm just going to drop the displacement node right here under the principled BSDF. So I can now just take the factor of the noise texture, and I'm going to plug that into the height value of the displacement. So this displacement node is going to convert any color data or black and white data into displacement data. So now I can take the displacement, and I'm going to plug that up into the displacement on the material output. And then I can Control Shift and select the principled BSDF. Now you can see that is way too strong. It's really bumpy, and oranges aren't that bumpy. And so I just want to give it a very, very subtle scale. So right here on the displacement node, I'm going to take the scale, and I'm going to change that to like a 0.15. So just like a 0.15. So now it's very subtle. But if you zoom in there, kind of on the edges, you can see it just looks a little bit lumpy. And that just makes it look a little bit more realistic. And then one more thing that I've done just to make this look a little bit nicer, if you go right here to the side panel, and you go right up here to the render properties, I'm going to go right down here, and I'm going to open up the color management. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to make sure this is set to filmic. And then on the look here, I'm going to change this to high contrast. And that way, it'll just pop out the colors and make it more contrasty. And there we have it. So there's the procedural orange peel material. So I hope you found this tutorial helpful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7O2Ji905dQ,Procedural Ice Material 🧊 (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural ice material, offering two versions: one for the Cycles render engine for a more realistic look, and another for the Eevee render engine, which is faster and in real-time. The tutorial provides step-by-step guidance on setting up nodes, adjusting textures, and configuring render settings for both engines. Viewers are encouraged to support the creator through purchasing the ice material on Gumroad, joining their Patreon, or buying procedural material packs. The tutorial also highlights the use of the Node Wrangler add-on and provides tips for achieving realistic lighting and transparency effects.","In this tutorial, we're going to be creating this procedural ice material in Blender. And in this video, I'm going to be creating two different versions of the ice material, one for the Cycles render engine, which is a bit more realistic, and then also another one for the Eevee render engine, because I know a lot of people do like to use Eevee because it's in real time and it renders faster. So I'll also be creating a version of this procedural ice in Blender Eevee. Now, if you do want to create this in Blender Eevee, then first create the one in Cycles because it is very similar. But then at the very end, I will just be showing you how to change this material up so that it works better in Blender Eevee because the process for using transparency and that kind of stuff is a little bit different in Blender Eevee. If you'd like to help support me and this channel, then you can purchase this procedural material on my Gumroad store. And you also get access to my procedural materials if you join my Patreon page. And another great way to help support the channel is by purchasing my Blender procedural material packs. So I create packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. Links in the description where you can purchase my procedural material packs on my Gumroad store. And that's a great way to help support me and this channel. Or if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. The links are in the description. All right, so real quick, let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So I pressed Shift A and I went right down here and added an icosphere. And then when you add the icosphere, I just turned the subdivisions up to like a six so that it is pretty subdivided. And then I also just shaded this object smooth. So I have a nice smooth sphere here to preview the material on. And then I also modeled this very basic ice cubes. This is just kind of like an ice block or an ice cube. And then for the modifiers on this object, I added a bevel modifier just to kind of bevel the edges. And then I also added in a subdivision surface just to kind of smooth it out. Now for the lighting right over here on the world, I added in this Simons Town Rocks 1K HDR. And this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. So link is in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. And using a nice HDRI is really helpful for creating this ice to look nice, because this ice is transparent. And so it's going to reflect a lot of the light. And you're kind of going to be able to see the colors from the background, because it is transparent. So I think this HDRI is really nice. Now you can see that if I press one on the numpad to go to front view, this is actually the front view. But I actually just rotated everything over so that we have these nice colors of like the ocean and the sky in the background. And also the light here, the sunlight kind of goes through the ice. So we're actually looking at it from the back. And so the sunlight is going to shine through that. And it makes the ice look really nice. And then I also added this plane here. And this plane just has a blank principled BSDF with a pure white color. And why I added this in is to get some nice bright reflections, because the ice does look a lot nicer if it has some nice bright reflections to make it brighter. So that's how I set up my blend file if you want to set it up the same way that I have. And then also if you click right over here on the render properties, I'm going to go down here and open up the film tab. And I'm going to checkmark the transparent button just so that I can't see the HDRI. Alright, and then one more thing before we get started, I am going to be using the node wrangler add on in this tutorial. So if you don't have that enabled, you can just click right here and edit and then open up the preferences. And then over there on the add ons tab, you can just search for the node wrangler and just checkmark the node wrangler add on and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So I'm just going to click on new here to add a new material in the shader editor. And I can just call this procedural ice. Alright, so to start off, I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And let's just drop the noise texture right here. Now using the feature from the node wrangler, if you hold down the Ctrl and Shift key, you can then select different nodes and that is going to preview the node. And then I'm also going to click right here and I'm going to drag this material and drop it on this object as well. Alright, so now we are previewing the noise texture on these objects. Now with the noise texture selected, I'm going to press Ctrl T and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I don't need the mapping. So I'm just going to click on it and then press x to delete it. And then I want to use the object coordinates because the object coordinates place the texture on the object more evenly. So I'm going to put the object into the vector on the noise texture. And then for the scale here on the noise texture, I'm just going to change this to like a four so that it is a bit smaller. And then I do want it to be pretty detailed. So I'm going to turn the detail all the way to the max, which is 15. Now why I'm creating this noise texture is because I want there to be a little bit of difference in the roughness. So I'm going to take the factor now and I'm going to put that into the roughness of the principled and that way some parts are going to be a little bit more rough and other parts will be a little bit more shiny. So let's just Ctrl Shift and select the principled BSDF to preview it. Now this totally isn't looking like ice right now. So let's make it look a lot more like ice. So what I'm going to do is turn this transmission value all the way up to one. And that way it's going to look a lot more like glass or ice. So the transmission value is going to make it transparent. And then right here on this IOR value, I'm going to be changing this value to a 1.31. So a 1.31. And I think that helps to make it look a little bit more like ice. Now if the ice is looking kind of dark, or if it's not allowing light to come through, there's a few reasons why that might be. One reason is that you might be using Blender EV. Blender EV works a little bit differently with transparency. So that's why I'm creating a separate part in this video on how to create the ice for Blender EV. But for this part we're going to be using Cycles. Now if it's still looking kind of off, or if it's looking a little bit dark, that might be because of the light paths. So click right here on the render properties and we're going to open up the light paths tab right here. So there's some different light path settings and the main one is this transmission value. So you can see if I turn this transmission value all the way to 0, that is telling Blender not to use any of the transparency. And it does actually render a little bit faster, but that's not going to work with a material like this which has transparency. So just make sure this is turned up. It's going to need to be at least turned up to like a value of 2. And then also make sure the total is turned up at least to that value as well. I'm going to turn the transmission up to like an 8. And also something to note is that when there are more and more layers of transparency, you're going to need to turn the transparency up more, or you're going to need to turn the transmission up more. And also just make sure the diffuse and glossy are turned up a little bit as well, because if they are turned down, you can see it's looking kind of black. So just make sure these are turned up a little bit. All right, let's go back to the procedural material. Now right now it's kind of looking like some sort of like frosted glass or something. It's very rough and we're not actually able to see very well through that ice. And that is because of this roughness value. So if I unplug the noise texture and then take the roughness and turn it all the way down, now you can like see through it really well. But I do want some parts to be a little bit more rough and some parts to be a little bit more reflective or see-through. So I'm going to take the factor from the noise texture and put that back into the roughness. So I want to adjust the colors in here to adjust the contrast of that. So I'm going to press Shift A. Let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And then let's just drop the color ramp right in here. And that'll automatically connect it up. So I can now start to drag these values closer together. And you can see it's going to be more contrasty. So I'm going to drag the white tab kind of to about here. And then I'm also going to drag the black tab closer. So we are basically making this texture more contrasty. If you Control Shift and select the noise texture, you can see this is how it is right now. But then if you Control Shift and select the color ramp, you can see it's much more contrasty. So I can Control Shift and select the principled BSDF. And you can see now some parts are rough, but then other parts are more see-through. Now I actually want to make everything just a little bit more rough. So I'm going to click on the black tab right here. And I'm going to make this a bit of a whiter color. And you can see as I start to turn it up, it is going to be more rough. And if you want to use the exact same hex value that I'm using, the exact same color, then you can click over on the hex value and you can type in 525252. So that is the exact color that I'm going to be using. All right, now I also want to use this noise texture here to give it a little bit of bump, just to make the surface a little bit bumpy. So I'm going to take the factor and I'm going to plug that into the normal right there. Now we need to convert this to normal data because this is black and white data. The factor here, it's black and white data, but this needs to be normal data because you can see there is a purple dot there. So I need a node in here to convert this. So let's press Shift A and I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to add a bump node. So a bump node will convert color data or black and white data into normal data. So we're going to drop the bump node right here. And then we actually want to plug the factor into the height value. So now you can see we've converted it to normal data. And so it looks really bumpy. Now that is way too strong. And so I want to make it much less strong. So I'm going to turn the strength value here down to just like a 0.2, just like a 0.2. And now you can see that it's looking a lot better, but I don't want the ice to be bumpy all over. I just want it to be bumpy in some parts here and there. So what I'm going to do is take this color ramp. I'm going to select the color ramp and I'm going to press Shift D to duplicate it. And we're going to drop it right in here between the factor and the bump. So drop it right in there. And now you can see that if I take this value right here, and I'm going to make it fully black, it is now more contrasty because we are pushing these together. And so you can see, especially if you drag this around, you can see that it's only bumpy in some areas. So I'm going to put this black tab kind of about here. And then I'm also going to click on this white tab right here, click on the color. And I'm going to make this a bit more of a gray color because I want it to be a bit less bumpy. You can see if I turn this all the way to black now, it doesn't really look bumpy at all. But if I turn it up, then it is very bumpy. So I'm going to bring this down a bit just so that those bumpy parts are a little bit less bumpy. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using, then you can go over to the hex value, and I'm going to be using a hex value of six times six. So six, six times. Now, something else that I want to do to make it look just a little bit more like ice is I want to make it just slightly blue. So I'm going to go over here to the base color on the principled. I'm going to click right here on this color and I'm going to make it fully white. And then I'm also just going to bring it over just a tiny bit. So it's just slightly more blue. It should be pretty subtle because if you make it a very strong blue color, then it just doesn't look realistic. I do just think it looks a bit nicer if it's just a very subtle blue color. And again, if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using over here on the hex value, you can punch in a value of D seven E nine FF. So just a very light blue. All right. So this is looking pretty cool, but I do just want to add a tiny, tiny little bit of noise or a little bit of bump all over the material. So what I'm going to do is actually click on this noise texture and I'm going to press control shift D. So instead of pressing shift D, I'm going to press control shift D and that is going to duplicate the texture, but it's going to keep everything plugged up to that texture. Now, why I'm duplicating this is because I want to turn the roughness value up on this noise texture to make the detail more fine. So I'm going to control shift and select this noise texture. You can see that's how it is. Now I'm going to turn the scale down to just like a one. So just turn it down to a one. And then on the roughness here, I want to turn this up and I actually want to turn it up to a value of a 0.8. So now that I've turned that up, if you zoom in there, you can see there's a bunch of very little fine detail. And so now I want to plug this into the normal as well. So I'm going to click on this bump node and I'm going to press shift D. So shift D will duplicate it. And I'm going to drop it right in here after this bump node. So the normal can just go through the normal, but we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So what I'm going to do is take the factor and I'm going to plug the factor into the height value of this bump. And then I'm going to control shift and select the final material. So just control shift, select the principle BSDF. Now, if you zoom in here, you can see it's definitely doing something. It's adding a bunch of little noise there and a bunch of little bits of detail, but it's actually a bit too strong and I do want it to be pretty subtle. So on this strength value, I'm going to turn this way down to like a 0.06. So pretty small, but now if I kind of zoom in here and let's just wait for this to load up and wait for the D noise to take effect, you can see there's just a bunch of little noise. You can especially see it right there. And so it does just add a bit more realism and just add a little bit of bump there to that ice. And that is it. So that is the finished procedural material for cycles. But now for everyone who wants to create this material in Blender Eevee, I'm going to be changing up the material a little bit now so that it works better for Blender Eevee. All right. So to get this to work in Blender Eevee, we first obviously need to change the render engine to Blender Eevee. So now it's loaded up, but you can see in Blender Eevee, it looks quite a bit different. It definitely doesn't look as realistic. And you can see there's also some issues here where there's some little white spots and the reflections don't look that good. And there's also no transparency. So I'm going to show you how to fix all of this now. So first, just a few settings we can do right here to make Eevee look more realistic. So what we can do is we can turn on this ambient occlusion, and then we can also turn on this screen space reflections. And then when you open up the screen space reflections, I'm also going to click on this refraction button. That is very important as well. All right. So now to get the transparency to work, I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for a mix shader. Let's click on the mix shader. And I'm going to drop it right down here, right before the material output. So I'm now going to press shift a, let's go to the search here, and I'm going to search for the transparent BSDF, add the transparent BSDF right here above the principled. And then I'm going to take the principled and I'm going to put that into the bottom shader. And then the transparent shader is going to go into the top one. So now we are mixing transparency with the principled. Now you can see that the transparency still isn't working. So there is a setting that we need to change in Blender EV to get the transparency to work. So what you're going to do is click right over here on the material properties, and then I'm going to scroll down here and open up the settings tab. Now, right here on the blend mode and the shadow mode, I'm going to click on these right now they're set to opaque, and I'm going to change these to alpha hashed. I find alpha hash to be the best ones. And so this is telling the material to use the transparency. So now if you look around here, you can see there's definitely some transparency, especially if you go inside there, you can see the transparency is definitely working because you're able to see through those objects. Now, if I turn the factor value all the way to zero, it's using all the transparency. So you're not able to see it at all. But if I drag the factor all the way to one, you can see it's not using any transparency. So instead of using a factor value, I just want to tell it where it's going to be transparent. And that is where this color ramp comes in. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually unplug the color ramp from the roughness. So just unplug it from the roughness here. Because you can see the roughness is really making the texture look quite weird. It's making it look very white. It's giving it these white patches. So if I unplug that, now that is like much better. And instead, I'm going to take the color from this color ramp, and I'm going to plug that into the mix shader factor. Alright, so that's looking a little bit better. But I still need to play around with some of these values because some of these spots are like super transparent, and they're kind of disappearing. So what I can do is I can actually drag this value back, I can kind of bring this back, I'm just going to bring it back to about here. And then I'm also going to make this a lighter color. And if you want to use the exact same value that I'm using, then over here on the hex value, you can type in a hex value of 727272. So that's much better. Now nothing is fully transparent, but there are some parts which are more transparent. And then in Blender Eevee, you are able to see the texture a bit better. So on the noise texture right here, I'm going to just do some things to make the noise texture look better. So I'm going to turn the scale value right here on the top noise texture down to just like a three, I think that looks a little bit better. And then I do want to adjust the bump just to make it look a little bit better in Blender Eevee because Eevee does act a little bit differently. So I'm actually going to take this gray tab right here before the bump. And I'm going to drag it over, just drag that over a little bit. And then I also want it to be a bit more bumpy. So I'm going to turn the strength value right here to just like a point three, I think that looks a little bit better in Blender Eevee. But then if I zoom in here, you can see all that little bit of noise is very grainy. And I think it's a bit too strong. So on the second bump here, this second bump controls all that little grainy detail. So on the second bump here, I'm going to turn the strength value down to like a point zero two instead of a point zero six. And now you're able to see through that better. And then if I didn't mention it earlier, make sure this roughness value is turned all the way to zero so that it is very reflective and you can see through it better. And then one more setting you can turn on to make it look a bit more realistic. Right back over here, if you go to the material properties and go down here to the settings right underneath the alpha hash, we can turn on the screen space refraction and you can see the difference. If I turn that on, it's going to reflect a lot more of the light and that is looking much better. So you can see here it is off and then here it is on. And then I do also just want to add a bit more light in Blender Eevee to brighten it up a little bit. So here in the 3D space, I'm going to press shift A. I'm going to go right down here to light and then I'm going to add an area light and then I can just press G to grab, just kind of bring it up here. I'll also press S to scale and I'm going to scale that up a bit. And then I'm going to double tap the R key and just kind of rotate this over a little bit. And I'm just going to rotate it kind of over here, just kind of bring it over here. So it's kind of pointed at the cube from the back. And then you can see that it's not actually doing that much. And that's because it's not very bright. So if you select the area light and then click right over here to the object data properties, you can turn up the power. And I'm actually going to turn the power up really big to like 10,000. So 10 and then after 10 hit three zeros and then hit enter. And I can also double tap the R key just to kind of rotate that around and just kind of rotate it to a position that looks good to you. But we now have that nice bright light reflecting off of the ice. And I think that looks a bit better in Blender Eevee. And there we have it. So there is the Eevee version of this material. Now, when you're rendering both of these materials, both the Eevee version and the cycles version, there can be quite a bit of noise, especially because there's all this light going through. And so to make this look a little bit nicer is after I render the images, I go right over here to the compositing tab. And then you're just going to click on use nodes to use the compositing nodes. And you should get a render layers and a composite. And so what I did is I just added this D noise here. So I just added the D noise. And then what you can do is you can just plug the image up to the D noise. And then you can plug the image up to the final composite. And so when you render this, it's going to D noise the image and kind of get away a little bit of that noise and just make it look a bit nicer. So there we go. There's both the Eevee version and the cycles version of this material. So that's going to be it for this tutorial. So thank you so much for watching. And I hope you found the tutorial helpful.

The instructor guides viewers through the process of setting up a 3D scene, using an icosphere, a free HDRI for realistic lighting, and the Node Wrangler add-on for efficient node management. The tutorial demonstrates how to use noise textures, mapping, and bump nodes to achieve the brushed metal effect, adjusting various parameters for detail and roughness. The presenter also offers options to purchase procedural materials and material packs on Gumroad, and provides links to related resources and a YouTube playlist for further learning.","Hello everyone, welcome to another procedural material tutorial. So in this one we're going to be creating this procedural brushed metal in blender. If you'd like to help support me and this channel then you can purchase this procedural material on my gumroad store and all of my patrons over on my patreon page also get access to my procedural materials. And another great way to help support the channel is by purchasing my blender procedural material packs. So I create packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with blender's procedural nodes. So if you'd like to check out the procedural material packs I'll have the links in the description where you can purchase on my gumroad store. Or if you'd like to learn how to create any of my procedural materials then I also have a blender procedural material playlist on youtube. The links are in the description. Alright so let me just show you real quick what I have in the 3d space. So I just pressed shift day and I went right down here and added an icosphere. And then right behind me if you click on the add icosphere settings I just turned the subdivisions up to like a six so it's pretty high detail. So we just have a nice smooth sphere to preview our material on. And then I just added a camera and pointed it right at the sphere. Now for the lighting if you click right over here onto the world properties I added in this photo studio broadway hall. And this is a free hdri from polyhaven.com. So if you'd like to use the same hdri that I'm using to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections I'll have the link in the video description. And so right here in the world you can just add a new world click here on the color on that little yellow dot and you can just change this to environment texture and then you can just open up the hdri. And I downloaded the 1k hdr version of this hdri. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add-on in this tutorial to preview different nodes. So to enable the add-on just click on edit and open up the preferences and then over there in the add-ons tab you can just search for the node wrangler and just check mark the node wrangler add-on and I'll show you how to use it in the video. Alright so just select the object whatever object you want to add the material onto and I'm going to click on new to add a new material in the shader editor. So to start off I'm going to press shift a and let's go to the search here and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's just drop the noise texture right down here. And then I'm also going to hold down the z button go up into the rendered view so I can preview how that's looking. Alright now to preview this node you can hold down the ctrl and shift key and then select different nodes. So just ctrl shift and then select different nodes and that is using the feature from the node wrangler add-on and it's going to preview different nodes using the viewer. Now I want to add a texture coordinate and mapping nodes to the noise texture so just make sure you have the noise texture selected and then you can press ctrl t and ctrl t is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Again that's another feature from the node wrangler. Now I want to use the object coordinates because the object coordinates are going to place the texture more evenly on the object so I'm going to use the object coordinates they work really well for procedural materials. And then let's go back over to this noise texture and I want to play with some of the settings. So on the detail here I want to turn this all the way up to the max which is 15 so it has more detail and then I'm going to turn the roughness value up to just like a 0.6 so it has a little bit more roughness and a little bit more detail in there. Now you can see this isn't really looking like brushed metal so that is where the mapping node comes in. So depending on your object you can change one of these scale values. So you can change the x scale or the y scale or the z scale and you can see that that is going to actually squish or stretch the texture. So I am going to scale it on the x value so on this mapping node on the x I'm going to scale this to like a value of 40. And now you can see we have that brushed metal look so there's all these little lines kind of going up and down on the brushed metal. Now to add just a little bit more variation to the brushed metal texture I'm going to turn the distortion value up. So on the distortion value here on the noise texture I'm going to turn this up to like a 3 and you can see it's going to add quite a bit more detail and also just add a little bit of variation kind of a little bit of a wobble there in the noise texture. Alright so now let's take the factor and we're going to plug the factor into the base color on the principled and then I can just ctrl shift and then select the principled bsdf. Now this doesn't look anything like metal so let's turn this metallic value all the way up to 1 and that way it's going to be treated as a metallic material. So just turn that metallic all the way up to 1 and then for now we can also like turn the roughness down to make it a little bit more shiny. Now I want to change the colors of the noise texture before it goes into the base color so to do this I'm going to press shift a let's go to the search here and I'm just going to search for a color ramp so let's click on the color ramp and I'm just going to drop it right here and then I want to make the colors a little bit more contrasty so I'm going to start to drag these together just to make them a bit more contrasty but then I don't want them to be white and black I want them to be a little bit more of gray colors so I'm going to click on the black tab and I'm going to make it a bit of a lighter gray and if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using on this darker color you can click right over here on the hex and then in the hex value you can type in 7 7 7 7 7 7 so 7 6 times that is the color that I'll be using and then also let's click right here on this white tab and I'm going to make this white tab a little bit darker just that it's a little bit more of a gray metal and again if you'd like to use the exact same color that I'm using then you can click over on the hex so just click on this color click on the hex value and I'm going to be using a hex value of b six times so b b b b b b so those are the colors that I'll be using all right now right now we are just using this one roughness value but I want to add a little bit of variation in the roughness so I'm going to add a texture and then put that into the roughness so what I'm going to do is press shift a and I'm just going to search for another noise texture so let's click on the noise texture and drop it down here now I do want to use the object coordinates on this noise texture but I don't want to plug it through the mapping because the mapping node is going to stretch the texture so I'm just going to take the object right here from the texture coordinate and I will plug that into the vector of the noise texture and then I can just control shift and select the noise texture and that way we can preview what the noise texture looks like all right now again I want to make the detail pretty high so I'm going to turn the detail all the way to the max which is 15 and I'm just going to leave the scale at a value of five and then the roughness right here I will just turn that up to like a 0.6 so it has a little bit more roughness all right so we can now take the factor from this bottom noise texture and I'm going to put it into the roughness value and then I can control shift and select the principled vsdf to preview it now I want a little bit more control over this because it is actually kind of rough so I'm going to click on this color ramp and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and let's just put it right in here so between this noise texture and the principled and this is going to go into the roughness so now I can drag around these sliders and that is going to change how rough it is so I'm actually going to switch these values so I'm going to bring the lighter color over here kind of to about here and then I can bring the darker value over a bit as well and now if you zoom in there you can see there's a little bit of variation so some parts are a little bit more shiny and then other parts are a little bit more rough all right so that is looking pretty cool but I do just want to add a little bit of bump so what I'm going to do is actually take this color right here the one which is going into the roughness and I'm going to put the color into the normal to give it just a little bit of bump now we need to convert this to normal data you can see there's some weird shading issues that is because this is color data but we need to convert it to normal data this is color data it is a yellow dot but this is normal data this is a purple dot so to convert this to normal data I'm going to press shift a and let's go to the search here and I'm going to search for a bump so let's take this bump node and we're going to stick it right in here between the color ramp and the normal and then I want the color to be going into the height value of the bump so now it's converting it to normal data but you can see that is super super strong so it's really rough so I want to make this much less strong so I'm going to turn this way down to a 0.01 on the strength value just a 0.01 so now if you kind of zoom in here you can see there's just a little bit of bump and if I control shift and select the bump you can definitely see it kind of right up here you can definitely see there's a little bit of bump there but it is very subtle of course if you want to make it more bumpy if I just control shift and select the principle bsdf you could totally turn the strength up a little bit maybe just like a 0.1 or a 0.2 but I kind of want it to be a smooth brushed metal so I'm going to turn the strength down to a 0.01 so it's very very smooth and then if you want to change the brightness of the metal a really easy way to do this is just by pressing shift a going to the search here you can just search for a hue saturation node so I'm just going to add the hue saturation value and you can put it right in here right before it goes into the base color and when you change the value that is going to change the brightness of that color so if you want to make it a darker metal you could just turn this down or if you want to make it a lighter metal kind of a white metal you could turn this up and that is it so that is the finished procedural brushed metal so I'll just give this a final render now so I hope you found this tutorial helpful and thank you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs2IVqPGcTM,Procedural Dried Fruit/Candied Ginger (Blender Tutorial),"The video discusses creating a procedural material in Blender that resembles dried fruit, crystallized ginger, or candy, using Blender's procedural nodes. The creator explains the process of setting up the Blender file, adding various textures like Voronoi and noise, and using displacement for realistic effects, recommending the Cycles render engine for better results. Additionally, the video promotes purchasing the procedural material through the creator's Gumroad store or Patreon, and offers access to other procedural material packs and tutorials for further learning.","So I was playing around with the procedural nodes in Blender and I stumbled upon this really cool material. And I thought this material would work really well for like some kind of dried fruit or maybe some crystallized ginger or some kind of candy. Like if you've ever eaten some dried papaya or some other dried fruit or maybe some candied ginger or crystallized ginger or maybe some type of candy, I just thought that this would be a really cool material to create a tutorial of. And let me know in the comments if you have some other ideas of what this could be used for. If you'd like to help support me and this channel, then you can purchase the procedural material on my Gumroad store and you also get access to the procedural material if you join my Patreon page. And if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials, then you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs. So they're packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. And if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then I have tutorials on how to create all of my procedural materials. You can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist. Again, the link is in the description. Alright, so real quick, I'm going to show you how I set up my Blender file. So what I did is I added a subdivided icosphere and shaded it smooth. And then I also added a cube and I added this to maybe be like a chunk of dried fruit or maybe some crystallized ginger or something like that. And then I also subdivided this cube. And why I subdivided it is because I'm going to be using the displacements in the shader editor. And I would recommend using the cycles render engine for this tutorial, because it will look more realistic in cycles and it was designed for cycles. And also if you want to use the displacements, then you're going to need to use cycles because Eevee doesn't support the displacements in the shader editor. Now for the lighting, I just added this circle here and I filled a face in the circle and I just pointed it at the objects. And then I added an emission material to this circle with a strength of 50, just to give it some nice bright lighting. And then also to help to get more realistic lighting and reflections, I also added in this Abandoned Hall 01 1K HDR. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. And I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download this. So I just added this into the world as an environment texture to get some nice lighting. And then if you'd like to use the displacements, let me just go over the settings to set that up. So you will need to use the cycles render engine if you want to use the displacement. And then if you want to use the adaptive subdivision or the adaptive displacement, then on the feature set here under the render engine, you can just set this to experimental if you want to use the adaptive subdivision. All right. So now what we need to do is create a material. So what I can do is just click on this object right here. And then right over here, I have the shader editor right here. I'm just going to click on new, and then I'm going to click and drag, and I'm going to drop this material onto this other cube as well. Now, right over here, if you go over to the material properties and scroll down, we need to tell this material to use the displacement. Just open up the settings tab, and then you're going to open up the surface. And then right here, you can see it says displacement, and I want to change this to displacement and bump. And that way we're telling the material to use the displacement. And then if you'd like to use the adaptive subdivision, then you can click right over here on the modifier properties, and you can click on add modifier. And then right down here, you can add the subdivision surface under generate. And then if you have the feature set set to experimental, then you can click on the adaptive subdivision, just checkmark that right there. And then I will just set the Dyson scale to five. And I'm going to do that for this object as well. So I will click on the cube. Let's click on add modifier, and I'm going to add the subdivision surface. And then I will checkmark the adaptive subdivision. You don't have to use the adaptive subdivision if you don't want to, you could just subdivide the object a lot so that it has lots of detail to be displaced. But I do like using the adaptive subdivision. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add on in this tutorial to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have that enabled, you can just click on Edit. And then you can open up the preferences. And then over there in the add ons tab, you can just search for the node wrangler and just checkmark the node wrangler add on. Alright, let's create the procedural material now. So I'm going to press Shift A, I'm going to go to the search here, and I'm going to add the Voronoi texture. So let's just click on the Voronoi, and I'm going to drop it down here. And then using the feature from the node wrangler, you can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and then select different nodes. And that's going to add the viewer node. And so it's going to preview the material on these objects. And then just make sure you have the Voronoi texture selected. And I'm going to press Ctrl T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. But then I don't need the mapping node because the mapping node is going to be used to change the location and rotation and scale of the texture, but I don't need to transform the texture. So I can click on the mapping and press x to delete it. And then let's just use the object coordinates. So I'm going to take the object and put that into the vector of the Voronoi texture. Now on the Voronoi texture here, I'm going to click on the f1 and I'm going to change it to smooth f1. So the difference between f1 and smooth f1 are pretty much the same. But when you have the smooth f1, you can change the smoothness value. So f1 doesn't have that smoothness value. But if you change it to smooth f1, now you have the smoothness value. So you can turn this from zero all the way up to one. And so that is going to change the smoothness of the texture. And I'm going to change the smoothness value to like a point three, five, so a point three, five. And then I'm also going to turn the scale down to like a three. So I want to use this Voronoi texture to give a little bump to the material. So what I actually want to do is use the color in the bump. So if you control shift and select the Voronoi texture again, you can see that we now have the color value and we're previewing the color value. So I want to use this in the normal to give it some bump. So I'm going to take the color and let's put the color into the normal. But then I need to convert this color data into normal data. You can see the color data is yellow, but then the normal data is purple. So we need a node in here to convert it to normal data. So I'm going to press shift a. I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for a bump node. So let's click on the bump node and I'm going to drop it right down here. So the color is actually going to go into the height value of the bump. So then to preview that I can control shift and select the principled BSDF. And you can see now the material has all those little bumps there. Now the material is white right now, and so I want to give the some color. So let's go right over here to the base color on the principled and I'm going to click right here on the color and I'm going to make it kind of a dark reddish orangish color. Actually not super dark, but kind of saturated and a little bit dark. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, then you can go over to the hex value and you can type in a hex value of a63312. So that is the color that I'll be using. All right, now you can see that this is mostly very very smooth and so I want to make it a bit more rough and bumpy. So I'm going to press shift a. Let's go to the search here and I'm going to search for a noise texture. So let's drop the noise texture right down here under the voronoi. And then I can control shift and select the noise texture so we can preview what it looks like. And also I do want to use the object coordinates on this texture as well. So let's take the object and we're going to plug that into the vector. And then on the scale here on the noise texture I'm just going to turn this to like a 2.5 so it's a bit smaller. And then I do want it to be very detailed so let's turn the detail level all the way up to the max which is 15. So I also want this noise texture to go through the bump to make it look bumpy. So to do this I'm going to click on this bump node and then I'm going to press shift d. Shift d will duplicate the node and I'm going to drop it right in here after this bump node. So the normal can just go through the normal on the bump node but we now have this extra height value that we can add data into to give it more bump. So I'm going to take the factor from the noise texture and I'm going to put that into the height right there. And then let's ctrl shift and select the principal bsdf to preview it. And I also need to bring the material output over here. So now you can see that this material is very very bumpy. Now this is a bit too bumpy so I'm going to take the strength value and I'm going to turn that down to like a 0.4. And also on this bump as well the first one I'm going to turn that down to like a 0.4 so it's not quite as bumpy. And that is looking much better. Now you can see that this is a very strong kind of orangey color and I want it to be a bit more yellowish and a bit more light and I also want a little bit of light to be going through this material. Kind of like with a piece of candied ginger or something there is just a little bit of light going through the object. It's just a little bit transparent or a little bit translucent. So to get this effect I'm going to be adding some subsurface scattering. So right here on the subsurface you can turn up the subsurface and now you can see that it's looking more smooth and soft and it's allowing more light to go through. So I'm going to turn the subsurface value to a 0.2. Now right here if I just like click and drag to make this principled shader bigger you can see it says subsurface color. So we can either put in some sort of texture or we can just change the color right here. So I'm going to click on the subsurface color and I'm going to make it kind of a yellowish orangey color. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using you can click over on the hex value and you can type in a hex value of ff9d59. So now you can see this is really starting to look like some sort of candy or ginger or dried fruit. Now I also want to play around with the roughness so you could just turn the roughness value up and down but I instead want the voronoi texture to affect the roughness. And that way some parts will be a little bit more rough and some parts will be a little bit more shiny. So I'm going to take the distance from the voronoi and I'm going to plug that into the roughness. Now I want a little bit more control over this so I'm going to press shift a. Let's go to the search here and I'm going to search for a color ramp node and let's just drop the color ramp node right here. So now we can change these colors and that is going to affect how rough and shiny it is. So if I click on this block tab if I start to turn it up you can see that when it is more light it is more rough. You can now see that this material looks super super rough but if I take this color and make it very dark it's going to be more shiny. So I do want this material to be pretty shiny but not too shiny so I'm just going to make this kind of a gray color just something like that is pretty good. Alright so this material is looking pretty cool but it still doesn't have any displacement and so I want to give it some displacement now. So what I'm going to do is actually join these two textures together and then we will use that to actually displace the mesh. So to join these two textures together I'm going to press shift a and let's go to the search here and I'm going to search for a mix rgb. So let's just drop the mix rgb right down here. So the mix rgb is going to mix different colors together so rgb stands for red green and blue so we can basically just use this node to mix textures or colors together. So I'm going to take this color from the voronoi texture and I'm going to put that into color 2 on the mix and then to preview what it's looking like you can hold down the ctrl and shift key and then select the mix to preview it. And then let's take the factor value from the noise texture and let's plug that into color 1. And then right here on the mix I'm going to click on this and I actually want to change it to add and then I'm just going to leave the factor at 0.5. You could play around with this. I'm going to leave the factor just in the middle at 0.5. So now if you zoom in here you can see there's some noise right there there's a little bit of noise here and there but then you can also see those little bumps there from the voronoi texture. So I'm now going to use this texture to actually displace the mesh. So what we need to do is we need to put this data into the displacement. So I can take the color and I can put that into the displacement. Now there is a problem with this. This is color data you can see it is a yellow dot but then this displacement right here this needs to be displacement data you can see it is a purple dot. So this is yellow and this is purple. So just like we converted this color data into normal data we need to convert this color data into displacement data so we can actually use the displacement properly. So to do this we're going to press shift a we're going to go to the search here and we're going to search for the displacement node. So let's click on the displacement node and then you can actually just find the wire so this wire right here you can just drop it right there and it's going to connect it up and then let's just drag the displacement right down here underneath the principled. So now the color from the add is actually going to go into the height value on the displacement and so this displacement node is going to convert this data into displacement data and then that can go into the displacement on the material output. So let's now control shift and select the principled BSDF to preview it. Now that is way too strong that is very very strong so on the scale here let's just turn this down so I'm going to turn this down to just like a 0.25 just a 0.25 and that'll make it much less strong that is a lot better. Now this cube right here is already very close to the shape that I want so what I'm going to do is actually duplicate this material and then just make the displacement much less strong. So what I'm going to do is click on this little icon here and it kind of looks like two pieces of paper and that is going to duplicate the material but it's going to keep the same information. So just make sure you have the cube selected and then on the displacement here on the scale I'm just going to turn this down to like a 0.1 so it's much less strong. So now you can see if I zoom in there you can see it is kind of bumpy here and there but it mostly resembles the shape of a cube and that is it so that is the finished procedural material. So I'll just give this a final render now. So thank you so much for watching this tutorial I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you found it helpful and as I mentioned at the beginning of this video if you'd like to help support me and this channel then you can purchase the procedural material on my gumroad store and my patrons on my patreon page also get access to my procedural materials and you can also check out my blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my materials and to learn how to create all of my procedural materials you can check out my blender procedural material playlist on youtube all the links are in the description but I hope you found this helpful and thank you for watching"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJEkhSXMTj4,Procedural Sci-Fi Metal (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial video, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural sci-fi metal material in Blender, suitable for both the Eevee and Cycles render engines. The process begins by developing the material in Eevee, emphasizing bloom and sci-fi details, and then creating a duplicate using displacements in Cycles to make the sci-fi elements pop out. The tutorial also offers resources for purchasing the finished material and supporting the creator through Gumroad and Patreon. Additional content and resources are available, including procedural material packs and a YouTube playlist for learning more about creating procedural materials in Blender. The video concludes with a thank you and encouragement to explore further materials and support options.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural sci-fi metal in Blender. And this sci-fi metal material works really great in both Cycles and Eevee. So we're going to start out by creating this version of the material, which is in Eevee, and I do think it looks really cool in Eevee. We have that nice bloom there and some cool sci-fi details. And then after we create the Eevee version of this material, we will duplicate the material and then create another material that uses displacements in the Cycles render engine. And here is the Cycles version of this material. So in Cycles, we are going to be using the displacements in the node editor to actually displace the mesh. So you can see that all these sci-fi bits here on this cube are actually popping out and being displaced. And you can also see it right there in those final renders. Now, if you'd like to help support me and this channel, as well as get the finished procedural material, then you can get the tutorial files over on my Gumroad store, and you also get access to the tutorial files if you join my Patreon page. And checking out my Gumroad store and Patreon page are really great ways to help support me and this channel. And if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials, then you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs. So they're packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. And after this tutorial, if you'd like to learn how to create more procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. All the links are in the description. And then just one more thing before we get started, I wanted to give a huge thanks to this video's sponsor, Sketchfab. On Sketchfab, you can upload, buy, and sell 3D models and assets. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can preview 3D models online in your browser. You can also purchase models and assets from Sketchfab's model store. You can use the model inspector to preview the wireframe, matcap, textures, and more before your purchase. Check out Sketchfab with the link below. All right, so now I'm going to show you how I set up the Blender file, if you'd like to set it up the same way that I did. So what I did is I pressed Shift-A to go to the add menu, and I added in a cube. And then I also pressed Shift-A, and I also added a plane, because I wanted to see what this material looks like on a flat plane. Now I'm just going to bring the plane over, and then I'm also going to press R to rotate, and I'm going to rotate it on the Y-axis. And I'm going to type in 9, 0, and Enter to rotate it over by 90 degrees. And then I'm also going to press Tab to go into edit mode, and I want to scale this up bigger. So in edit mode, I'm going to press S to scale, and then I'm going to type 3, and then Enter. And then I will press Tab to go back into object mode, and I'll just bring this over. And then for the lighting, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go right down here to light, and I'm just going to add an area light. And then I'm going to press G to grab, and then R to rotate, and I'm just going to rotate it and kind of stick it right here so it's pointing at the objects. And then right over here, if you go to the object data properties of the light, I am going to turn the power up pretty high to like a 500, and then also I'm going to turn the size up right here just to make it a bit bigger. And then to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections, I also added in this Machineshop 021K HDRI, and this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com, so I'll leave a link in the description if you'd like to download and add in the same HDRI that I'm using. So right over here, if we go to the world properties, you can add a new world, and then you can just click right here on this yellow dot next to the color, and you can change it to environment texture, and then you can just open up the HDRI that you've downloaded. And then let's also go over the settings for the render engine. So you can use whichever render engine you want. You can use Blender Eevee, or you can use Cycles. If you want to use the displacements at the end of this tutorial, then you're not going to be able to use Eevee because Eevee doesn't support the displacements in the node editor. So if you want to use the displacements, you can change it to Cycles. Now I'm going to start off with Eevee and create the material with Eevee, and then at the end, I will switch to Cycles and then add the displacement. Now to make Eevee look a little bit more realistic, I'm going to turn on the ambient occlusion and the screen space reflections, and then also if you want to add a little bit of a glow on the brighter areas, I'm going to be turning on the bloom there, and that'll add a glow to the bright areas. And then I am in the shading tab right up here, so I have the shader nodes right here, and then also right over here I have the 3D space, and I just went up into the rendered view by holding down the Z button and moving up into the rendered view. So let's just select one of the objects, and I'm going to click on New, and I can just rename this material Procedural Sci-Fi Metal. All right, and then you can also click and drag, and it's going to bring out the material, and you can drop the material onto the other object as well. All right, so I'm now going to zoom in here to the shader nodes. So the first thing I want to do is make it darker, because it's very bright, and because it's so white, it's actually kind of being reflective. So I want to take the base color, and I just want to turn that down to like a gray color, so it's not quite as bright. And then also I want to make it a metallic material, because it is a metal material. So this metallic value, I'm going to turn that all the way up to one, so it is now a metal material. And then also you can just turn the roughness down a little bit if you want to. Now I don't just want it to have one roughness value, I want some places on the texture to be more rough, and other places on the texture to be less rough. And then I don't want to be using just one roughness value, I instead want to add in a texture that'll control the amount of roughness. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go to the search here, and I'm going to search for the noise texture. So let's click on the noise texture, and I'll just drop it down here. And then also I am going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial, so it's built into Blender, so you just need to enable it. So if you haven't already enabled the Node Wrangler add-on, you can just click right here on edit, and then you can open up Blender's user preferences. And then over there on the add-ons tab, if you just search for the Node Wrangler right up there on the search, you can just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on, and then you can use the features of the Node Wrangler, and then just close the user preferences. So now that you have the Node Wrangler add-on enabled, you can select a node, and then you can press Ctrl-T. And when you select the texture and press Ctrl-T, it's going to automatically add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I don't want to use the mapping in the noise texture, but I am going to be using the mapping node later. So I'm just going to drag the mapping node down, and then I don't want to use the generated texture coordinate, I want to use the object coordinates instead. So I'm going to take the object, and I'm going to pull out a wire from the object and put that into the vector. And then also I can just take the object and put that into the vector here as well on the mapping, and we'll be using the mapping node later. Now I want to be able to preview what the noise texture is looking like, so I'm going to hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and then select the node. So when you hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and select different nodes, that is going to preview what the node is looking like, and that is a feature from the Node Wrangler add-on. So let's now take the factor value from the noise texture, and I'm going to plug that into the roughness of the principled. And then I also want to play around with some of the noise texture settings. So on the detail here, I'm going to bring that all the way up to the max, which is 15, so it has a lot of detail in there. And then I also want to give it some more roughness. So on the roughness value, I'm just going to change that to like a 0.7, so it has more roughness. So I can now hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and then select the principled BSDF, and that is going to preview it. And so because we're plugging the noise texture into the roughness, some parts are going to be more rough, whereas other parts are going to be more shiny. Now I want to have more control over this, so I want to be able to change the colors of the noise texture. So I'm going to press Shift-A, let's go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and let's click on the color ramp, and I'm just going to drop it right in here. So the factor is going to go to the factor of the color ramp, so then the color can go into the roughness value of the principled BSDF. So I can now change the colors in here, and that is going to change how rough it is. So if you make these colors a lighter color, then they are going to be more rough. So I'm going to click on this first tab here, and I'm going to drag this tab over, and that is going to make it a little bit more contrasty. And then you can see that it's pretty shiny, and I don't want it to be that shiny. So if I make the values more white, then they are going to make it more rough. So I can click on the black tab, just click on this little black thing right here, that's going to open up the color, and then I can make it a bit brighter, and you can see as I make it brighter, the material is becoming more and more rough. So I don't want it to be super rough, but also not super shiny, so I'll just bring it to there. So I will just make it a little bit more rough, something like that, but it is a metal material, so it should be somewhat shiny. So this is kind of a cool metal material, but we don't have any of those sci-fi details. So let's create that. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's just click on the Voronoi texture, and I'm going to drop it right down here under the noise texture. Now I do want it to use the object coordinate, so I could plug the object into the vector of the Voronoi, but I want to be able to control the location of the Voronoi texture. So that is where the mapping node comes in. So the object is going to go into the vector, but then we want the mapping node to be going into the vector of the Voronoi. And so then if we change these values, that is going to change the location, rotation, and scale of the Voronoi texture. And then I'm also going to hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and select the Voronoi to preview it. Now that doesn't really look sci-fi, that looks pretty organic. So to make it look more sci-fi, I'm going to click on the F1, and I'm going to change this to F2. And then I'm also going to click on this value right here, and I'm going to instead change this one to the Chebyshev. So now that I've changed this to the Chebyshev, you can see that now we have all of these little squares in here. Now it doesn't look very contrasty, and so I want to make it more contrasty. So I'm going to press Shift A, let's go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a ColorRamp node. Let's click on the ColorRamp and drop it down here. And then I can take the distance value from the Voronoi, and I want to drag out a wire and put that into this ColorRamp. And then to preview the ColorRamp, I can Ctrl Shift and select the ColorRamp. So now what I can do is I can click on these tabs, and I can start to drag them closer together. And you can see as I drag them closer together, it's going to be more contrasty. So I'm going to drag these two values pretty close to each other, so we now have this really cool sci-fi texture right here. So now what I want to do is I want to put this texture into the normal to give it some fake bumps, so it looks like it is popping out. So I'm going to take the color, and I'm going to put that into the normal, just like that. And then I'm also going to Ctrl Shift and select the principled BSDF to preview the final material. Now you can see that it's not really popping out. Something definitely looks wrong here, and that is because this is color data. It is a yellow dot, but then this here, this is normal data, and so it is purple. And so we need a node in here to convert this color data into normal data. So to convert this, I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a bump node. So let's add a bump node, and I'm going to drop the bump node right in here between this wire, and that's going to plug it up. Now I actually want to take the color, and I want to put the color into the height value. So now this bump is going to convert color data, or black and white data, into normal data. And so now if you zoom in here, you can kind of see that it looks like these little squares are being popped out. Now it is way too strong, so on the strength value right here, I'm just going to change this to like a 0.2. So a 0.2, and that is now less strong, but now it looks like these pieces here are all popping out. And then this Voronoi texture is really big, so back over here on the Voronoi texture, I'm going to change the scale just to like a 1.7, so that it is smaller. So that's looking much better. So now we're starting to get a really cool sci-fi texture. Now I also want to add this Voronoi texture into the base color to change the colors, because right now it is just this color here. It's just this color that we added here in the base color, but I instead want to use a texture. So I'm going to take the distance value from the Voronoi texture, and I'm going to drag out a wire, and I'm going to put that into the base color. But then I want to be able to change the colors in here, so I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to go to the search here, and again I'm going to search for a color ramp. So let's click on the color ramp, and I'm just going to drop the color right in here between this wire, and that is going to plug it up. So the distance is going to go into the factor, and then the color can go into the base color. So now we can play around with these colors to change the color of the metal. Now one thing that I want to do is I want to click on this linear, and I'm instead going to change it to constant. And that way you can see that there's not any blending between these two colors. So if I now drag the white tab, you can see there isn't any blending, whereas before when I had this set to linear, if I kind of bring these together you can see there's a bit of a blending. You can see there's white up here and then black there, but if I instead change this to constant, now there isn't going to be any blending. So I want to drag this black tab way over here, and then I'm going to drag this white tab kind of over about here. Now I don't want it to be fully black, so I'm going to click on this black tab, and I'm going to click on the color, and I'm going to make it a bit brighter, so it's kind of just a dark gray. And then I'm going to click on this white tab, and for this white tab I'm going to make it a bit darker, so it's going to be kind of a darker gray as well, but not quite as dark. So just something like that is pretty good. Now I also want to add another color value, so you could click on the plus right there to add another tab, but you can also just hold down the ctrl key and then click, and that is going to add another tab right there. And then you can just drag the tab around, I want it to be kind of about there. Now this tab, I'm going to make it an orange color, so I'm going to click on the color here, and I'm going to make it very bright, and then I'm going to drag right here and make this an orange color. And then you can also drag this tab around to add more of the orange or less of the orange. I'm going to leave it right here though, because I also want to add another gray color right over here. So what I'm going to do is hold down the ctrl key and then just click right there, and that's going to add another tab right there, and you can see it's the same gray color. So I'm now just going to drag this gray tab over, and I'm going to drag it pretty close to the orange, and now you can see that there's just all these little stripes here of orange, and then there also are a few squares here and there. Now I also just want to add one more color in here. I want to add a lighter gray, so I'm going to hold down the ctrl key and just click right in here between these two colors. That's going to add another orange one, but then I can click right here. Let me just zoom out a little bit. I'm going to click on the orange here, and I'm going to go to the RGB, so just click over on the RGB, and I'm going to drag all of these values up to one, and that is going to make it fully white. And then I can just click right up here, and I can drag this down, and that's going to make it kind of just like a light gray. So now you can see we have three different shades of gray, and then we also have the orange colors here and there. All right, so we are almost done with this material, but there is one more thing I want to do. I want to add some little glowing lights on this sci-fi metal. So what I'm going to do is drag these two color ramps up because I want to give another space right in here for one more color ramp. I can now click on this color ramp right down here, the very bottom one, and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it. So shift d is the shortcut key to duplicate the node, so just duplicate that. And then I'm going to take the distance right here from the voronoi, and I'm going to plug that into the factor. So then I can control shift and select this color ramp, and that is going to preview it. So wherever the values are white, that is where it is going to be emitting light. So I'm going to click on this white tab, and I'm going to drag it all the way over here to this side, and then I can drag the black tab over as well. And I do want to drag this black tab pretty far because I don't want very many parts to be emitting light. I just want some little parts here and there to be emitting light. Now also you can see that it's a very dark color, it's kind of a gray color, and that is because this is kind of blending. So I'm going to click on this linear, and I'm going to change this to constant. And there we go, so now it is only white and black. So I now want to put this into the emission value to tell it where it's going to be emitting light. So I can take this color here, and I can plug that into the emission on the principled shader. And so wherever it's white, that is where it's going to be emitting light. So I can now control shift and select the principled VSDF. And we'll just wait for that material to load up, and you can see that there are those little places where it's emitting light. Now it's not very strong right now, so right underneath this emission value we have an emission strength. So I'm going to turn this up to like a five, and that way it's going to be much brighter. And then also you could just leave it to this white color, but on this color ramp here, I'm actually going to click on this white tab, and then I can make this a color, and that way it'll be the color of the light. So I'm going to keep it pretty bright. I'm going to keep it mostly white, so I'm going to keep it right here in the center. But I'm just going to drag this over a little bit more towards the orange, so it's kind of like a light yellowish orange. And now you can see that glowing there. That glowing is just kind of an orangey color. And there we have it. So there is the finished Eevee version of this material. So just press control s to save, and make sure you save your Blender file. Now before we do the Cycles version of this material, if you want to change the mapping of the Voronoi texture, you can change this mapping right here. So if you want to change where the texture is placed, you can drag the X right here, so the X location, and you can see it's going to drag the location of that texture, so it'll kind of change the texture. You could also change the Y value, and that'll go back and forth. But what you can also do, and this is like the coolest part, is you can drag the Z value. So when you drag the Z value, it's changing the location of the Voronoi texture on the Z axis. And so it's basically going to randomly generate the sci-fi texture differently every time you move it. So I'm now going to duplicate this Blender file, and then make the version for Cycles. So I'm going to press control s again to save, just save this Blender file. And then I'm going to click on file, and I'm instead going to click on save as. And when you do that, Blender's file browser will come up. And then I'm not going to rename this to Tutorial, because this is the current version. I want to create another version, which is for Cycles. So I'm going to rename this to Tutorial Cycles. All right, Tutorial Cycles, and I will click on save as. You don't have to follow along with that though, if you just want to do this within the same Blender file. So now let's change this Blender file over to Cycles. So I'm going to make the properties right here a bit bigger, just kind of bring this out. And then I'm going to click on the render engine, and I'm instead going to change this to Cycles. So we're going to use the Cycles render engine, and you can see it looks very similar. Now I am going to be using the displacement, so let me show you how to set that up. Now I'm also going to be using the adaptive displacement, and so what that's going to do is it's going to add more detail where you're closer up to the mesh, but then if you're farther away it'll add less detail. So you don't have to use the adaptive displacement if you don't want to, but if you want to use the adaptive displacement, then right here under Cycles, you need to change the feature set to experimental. All right, so now what we're going to do is we're going to click right down here on the material properties, and you need to open up the settings tab right here. Now right now on this displacement, it is set to bump only, but I want to tell the material to use the displacement. So I'm going to now change this to displacement and bump. And then I'm also going to hold down the Z button, go back into solid view and let go, and I'm going to hold down the shift key and just select both of these objects, and then I'm going to press the tab key to go into edit mode. So these objects are very low poly and they don't really have any detail, so I want to subdivide these so they have more detail for the displacement. So I use the right click select, so I use the W key to make the object context menu come up. You can also just right click and then the object context menu will appear, and I'm going to click on subdivide. So after you click on subdivide, you can see that it's actually subdivided the mesh, and then right behind me, if you click on that little subdivide setting right there, you can just open that up, and then right up here you can change the number of cuts. So I'm going to turn the number of cuts up pretty high, maybe to just like a 10, and then I'm going to press tab to go back into object mode, and I will just select the plane, and then I will tab to go back into edit mode on just the plane. And then again, using the object context menu, you can click on subdivide, and I'm just going to subdivide the plane a little bit more because the plane is bigger. And on the number of cuts here, I'll just change this to like a two, and then I can just click on this little arrow here to hide these subdivide settings. And I can just hit the tab key to go back into object mode. So we've added some detail, but I also want to add more detail, and so I'm going to be adding the adaptive subdivision. So I'm going to click right over here on the modifier properties, and then just select one of the objects. So to add the adaptive subdivision, or the adaptive displacement, I'm going to click on add modifier, and under generate, I'm going to add the subdivision surface modifier. Now you can see that when you add the subdivision surface, it kind of smooths out the edges. So right here from Catmull-Clark, I'm going to instead change this to simple, and now you can see those edges are very straight. Now to use the adaptive subdivision, it's right here. You can just check mark the adaptive subdivision. Now on the dicing scale, if you make this value smaller, then it's going to be more detailed, but then if you make this value bigger, it's going to be less detailed. So I really don't need the dicing scale to be set to one. That's actually pretty high detail. So I'm going to click on the dicing scale, and I'm going to change this to like a 20. So I'll just change it to like a 20, and you can see right here that it tells us that the final scale is going to be more detailed, but the viewport will be less detailed, just so that it'll render faster in the viewport. So I basically want to do the same thing for this cube. So I'm going to click on the cube, and I can click on add modifier, and then I'm going to add the subdivision surface, and then I want to click on the adaptive subdivision, and then you can see that the subdivision surface kind of smooths out the edges here. So if you want to, you can change this to simple. I am actually going to leave this at Catmull-Clark because I do like kind of the smoothing there on the cube. I think that looks pretty nice. And then there are just two more things I want to do. In object mode, I'm going to use the object context menu to shade the cube smooth, and then I'm also going to again tab into edit mode, and then using the object context menu again, I'm going to subdivide this one more time so that those edges are more sharp. And then I can just tab to go back into object mode. Alright, so then on the dicing scale again, just select the cube, and on the dicing scale, I really don't need it to be set to one. That's actually pretty high detail. So I'm going to click on this value, and I'm just going to change it to like a value of 20. Alright, so I'm now going to hold down the z button and go up into the rendered view, and let's also press ctrl s to save the blender file. So you can see there is the texture, but it's not actually being popped out of the mesh. So what I need to do is put a value here into the displacement. So I'm first going to press shift a, and then I'm going to go to the search here, and I'm going to search for the displacement node, and I'm going to put the displacement node right here under the principled shader. Because just like this bump node, we use this bump node to convert color data into normal data. So I need the displacement node to convert color data into displacement data. So I'm going to take the displacement, and I'm going to drag this right up here into the displacement on the material output. Now you can see that it is kind of distorting the mesh, so I now want to add in a texture here to tell it where it's going to displace the mesh. So we already have the perfect texture for that, and that is this color ramp right here. Because this color ramp, if I ctrl shift and select it, you can see this color ramp here has all of the boxes. So I'm just going to ctrl shift and select the principled bsdf again, and I'm going to take the color right here, and I'm going to plug the color from this bottom color ramp into the height value of the displacement. And now you can see that those boxes are popping out, and it looks really cool and sci-fi. Now this is popping out way too much, and I don't want it to be popping out this much. So on the scale here, I'm going to click on the scale on the displacement, and I'm just going to change it to like a 0.06. So a 0.06, and that way it's still going to be popping out, but it's much less strong. And you can really see it on the cube, it looks especially good on the cube. So you can see right there all those little bits and pieces are all popping out, and that makes it look really cool and sci-fi. And of course if you wanted to, you could turn the scale up, like for instance maybe a scale of 0.4, and that is really going to pop out the mesh. But I don't really like that, that is kind of popping out too much, so I'm going to turn the scale to like a 0.06. So a 0.06, and so that looks really cool. It kind of looks like some sort of sci-fi storage box with like little bits popping out here and there. So that is it, that is the finished cycles version of this sci-fi metal. So I'll just give this a final render now. So there we have it, so there is the finished procedural sci-fi metal material. So that's going to be it for this tutorial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsVgkJeH7Yo,Procedural Coal Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to develop a procedural coal material, emphasizing the use of displacements in the node editor with the Cycles render engine for a bumpy appearance. An alternative method for Blender Eevee users is also provided, which involves creating basic chunky coal objects without displacement. The tutorial further explains how to set up materials using Voronoi and noise textures, adjust roughness and specular settings, and apply adaptive displacements for detailed rendering. Additionally, the creator mentions the availability of tutorial files and procedural material packs for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon to support the channel.","In this Blender tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural coal material. If you'd like to help support me and this channel as well as purchase the tutorial files, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description. And I've also created another 10 procedural materials, and so I've just released Blender Procedural Material Pack number 7. So as many of you know, I do create a lot of procedural material tutorials, and so every time I create 10 more procedural materials, I compile them together into a procedural material pack. So if you'd like to check out my procedural material packs, I'll have the links in the description where you can purchase on my Gumroad store. And purchasing the material packs is a really great way to help support me and this channel so I can continue to create more tutorials. And if you'd like to learn how to create more procedural materials, then I'll also have a link in the description to my Blender Procedural Material tutorial playlist where you can learn how to create all of my procedural materials. Now to make the coal lumpy and bumpy, I am going to be using the displacements in the node editor. And so because of that, I will be using the Cycles render engine in this tutorial. Because in Blender Eevee, the node editor displacements will not work. Now if you don't want to use the displacements, you totally don't have to. And if you would rather use Blender Eevee for this tutorial, then I will show you how to create some basic chunky coal objects. And then we will be creating a separate variation of this coal material without the displacement and it'll work better for Blender Eevee. Here is the material in Blender Eevee. So it does work pretty well in Eevee, but you can see that the node editor displacements don't work. And so this mesh here isn't bumpy at all, it's very smooth. So if you don't want to use the displacements or if you want to use Blender Eevee, you can totally do that. And I will show you how to create these little coal objects. So in the 3D space, I just pressed Shift-A, and then I went right down here and I added an Icosphere. And then when you add the Icosphere, right behind me, if you click on the little Add Icosphere settings, you can turn up these subdivisions. And I just turned it up to like a 6. And I did want to turn it up pretty high so that it's nice and smooth, but I also want to turn this up pretty high so that it has more detail for the displacements. And I will also be setting up the adaptive displacement in this tutorial so that where it's rendering from, it'll be a little bit higher detail, but then it will be lower detail where it's farther away. And then I also just shaded this object smooth. And then for the lighting, I just added a circle right here, and I just pointed the circle at the object. And then I also just gave it an emission material with a strength of 50. And that way we get some nice bright lighting on our sphere here. And if you're using Blender Eevee, then the emission material won't actually be emitting light. It'll just look like it's bright, but it won't actually be emitting light. So if you're using Blender Eevee, you can just press Shift-A and you could just like go down here to light and just add a normal sunlight. And then I'm just going to like rotate the sunlight over, just point it over there. And then right over here on this side panel, you can go to the object data properties of the light and you could just turn the strength up. Maybe I'll just turn mine up to like a 10. If you're using Blender Eevee, you could use that light instead. And then to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections, I added in this Abandoned Hall 01 1K HDR. And this is from polyhaven.com. So the link's in the video description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. So right here in the world nodes, what you can do is you can just add a new world and then click right here on this yellow dot here next to the color. And you can change this to environment texture. And then you can just click on open and open up the HDRI. And then for those other chunky coal pieces, let me show you how I created those. So I actually used a Blender add-on and it's built in a Blender. So you just need to enable it. So to enable the add-on, you can click right here and edit and then open up the preferences. And then in Blender's user preferences, you can just click over on the add-ons tab. And on the search here, you can search for extra. And then right here, you can just check mark the add mesh extra objects add-on. And when we add this in, there's going to be a rock generator that will generate rocks for us. And also I will be using the node wrangler add-on in this tutorial when we're setting up the procedural node. So while we're in the user preferences, you can just search for node right up here on the search and just make sure you turn on the node wrangler add-on. And then you can just close the user preferences. All right, so now that the add mesh extra objects add-on is turned on, I can press shift A and if you go right here to search, you can see that there are a bunch of new objects here. And so I'm going to click on this one right here, which is the rock generator. And then this is going to generate rocks for us. Now don't move the rock around or anything. Right after you add the rock, you can click on this add rocks right here. So click on the add rocks and that is going to open up this tab. And you can see that there are a bunch of different settings here to change the rocks. So you can change the X, Y, and Z scale if you want to change the scale of it. And there are a bunch of different settings here, like the detail level and the display detail and the amount of smoothness. I'm just going to leave all the settings at the default, but you can definitely play around with these settings. One thing I want to do though is add more rocks. So right here it says number of rocks right up on the top here. And so I'm just going to turn this number up to three and that is going to generate three rocks. So I can now just click on this little tab here to close the add rocks and I'll just bring myself back over. All right, so now that you've added those rocks, you can just select the rocks and you can press G to grab and you can just move these rocks over and you can see that it's generated rocks for us. Now, if you click right over here on the modifier properties, you can see this is what the add-on's done. So if you actually press the tab key to go into edit mode, you can see these rocks are actually pretty simple, but then the rock generator has added some subdivision surface modifiers to give it more detail. And then it's given it all these displacements to give it lots of bump. And also when you render these rocks, they will be higher detail, but you can see right here on the subsurf modifiers, the viewport is set to two, but the render is set to three. So when it renders, it'll actually be rendered with higher detail. If you want to preview the final detail though, how detailed it's going to be when it renders right here on the levels viewport, you can click right here and turn that up to three. And then that'll show how it's going to look when it's actually rendered. So I'm just going to do that by clicking on the next rock and then turning the viewport to three and the viewport right here to three. And then I will click on this one. And then I can turn the viewport to three and the viewport to three. And then if you want to change the shape of the rocks, you can select the rock and press tab. And that is going to go into edit mode. And you can just select some points and press G to grab. And you can just play around with the shape of those rocks if you want to change them, because that rock was a bit sharp and I didn't want it to be quite that sharp. And you can also scale the rocks and rotate them and just kind of get them into place. Now, of course, these look like rocks, but they will work really well for chunks of coal as well. And then I also added a camera and just stuck the camera right here looking at the objects. So I'm just going to move these rocks around and place them where I want. All right. Now, just one more thing I want to do before we set up the procedural material. I want to set up the displacements and the adaptive displacements on this object right here. So what I'm going to do is click right up here on the render properties. And if you want to use the displacements in the node editor, then you need to be in cycles. So just make sure right up here on the render engine that you have it set to cycles if you want to use the displacement. Now, I am also going to change the feature set to experimental because I want to use the adaptive displacement. Now, it's totally optional. If you don't want to use the adaptive displacement, you don't have to. And what the adaptive displacement does is it makes the object higher detail where it's closer up. But then parts of the object which are farther away from the camera are going to be less detail. I will be setting this to experimental to use the adaptive displacement. So now I need to add a material. So I'm going to select this object right here. And then I can click on new. And I'm going to rename this material to procedural coal. Now we need to tell this material to use the displacement. So what I'm going to do is click right over here on the material properties. And then I'm going to scroll down. And then right down here, you can open up this settings tab right here. And remember, if you're using Blender Eevee, then this will not work. So make sure you are using cycles. So then on the displacement right here, it's set to bump only. I want to change it to displacement and bump. And that way we're telling the material to use the displacement. And then if you want to set up the adaptive displacement, you can. So to set up the adaptive displacement, I'm going to click right here on the modifier properties. And then I'm going to click on add modifier. And I'm going to go right down here and add a subdivision surface modifier on this sphere object. And then because we turned the feature set to experimental, you can see that there is this adaptive subdivision. So you can just checkmark that. And then I will just set the dicing scale to five. That works pretty well for my object. And then I'm going to hold down the Z button and move up into the rendered view. And let go to preview that in the rendered view. All right, so let's finally set up the procedural material now. So I'm going to start by pressing Shift-A. Let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for a voronoi texture. We're just going to drop the voronoi right down here. Now, I also want to use the object coordinates. So with this voronoi texture selected, I'm going to press Control-T. And that is using the feature from the Node Wrangler add-on. We turned on the Node Wrangler at the starting of this video. And so this is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now, I don't actually need the mapping node because the mapping node is just going to change the location of the texture. But I don't need to do that. So I'm going to click on the mapping and I'll press X to delete it. And then I want to use the object coordinates so I can plug the object into the vector. And then also using the main feature of the Node Wrangler add-on, if you hold down the Control and Shift key, you can then select different nodes. And that is going to add this viewer node right here. And it'll allow you to preview what the node's looking like. Now, I actually want to hold down the Control and Shift key and then select it again. And this one is going to go to the color. So we can preview the color from the voronoi. Now, if I zoom in here, you can see that those edges are very, very sharp and I want them to be more smooth. So I'm going to click on the F1 and I'm instead going to change it to Smooth F1. So Smooth F1 is pretty much exactly the same, but we have this smoothness value right here. So I can now just change the smoothness value. And you can see it's going to be kind of more blurred. So on this smoothness value, I'm going to change this to a 0.34, just that it's a little bit blurred. And then I'm also going to turn this scale value down to like a 2. Now, I want to put this into the normal to give it some bump. And then I will also be adding this into the displacement. So the first thing we can do is take the color. And we're going to put the color into the normal to give it some fake bump. But then I need to convert this to normal data because this is color data. You can see it's yellow. But then this right here, this is normal data and it's purple. So I need a node in here to convert this data to normal data. So I'm going to press Shift A. And let's go to the search here. And I can search for the bump node. And let's drop the bump node right down here. So the color is actually going to go into the height on the bump. And then the normal can go into the normal. So I can now Control Shift and select the principled BSDF. And you can see now it looks kind of bumpy. Now, it's kind of hard to see because it is so white. So on the base color here on the principled, I can just turn this way down to like a dark color. Or you can make it fully black. And you can now see those bumps in there. Now, that is a little bit strong. And I do want to make it a bit less strong. So on the strength value right here, I'm going to turn this down to like a 0.4. So it's not quite as strong. Now, you can see that this isn't actually displacing the mesh. That's because this is just the normal. But we are going to be adding this value into the displacement as well to make it actually pop out of the mesh. Now, I also want to give this material a lot more detail. So I'm going to press Shift A. Let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for a noise texture. And let's drop the noise texture right down here underneath the Voronoi. And I can just bring the Voronoi up a little bit. And then I want to use the object coordinates as well on the noise texture. So I'm going to plug the object into the vector. And so the object coordinates are going to place the texture on the object more evenly. And then I can also hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and select the noise texture. And that is going to preview it. And then on the scale here on the noise texture, I'm going to change this down to like a 2. But then I do want to give it lots of detail. So I'm going to drag the detail level all the way to the max, which is 15. So I now want to plug this noise texture into the bump as well. So I'm going to click on this bump node, kind of bring it over. And then I'm going to press Shift D to duplicate it. And I'm going to drop it right in here. So the normal is going to go through the normal. And then that's going to go into the principled. So we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So I'm going to take the factor from the noise texture. And I'm going to plug that into the height right here. So I can Ctrl, Shift, and select this bump. You can see that's what it looks like. But then we're adding two bump maps together. So I can Ctrl, Shift, and select this bump. And you can see now we have all that bumpiness right there. And that's going to make it look a lot like coal. And then I can Ctrl, Shift, and select the principled BSDF. And that is looking really cool. All right. Now we haven't actually put anything into the base color yet. So let's do that. So what I'm going to do is press Shift A. And I'm going to search for a mix RGB. Let's drop the mix RGB right here. Because what I want to do is I want to take this texture and this texture. And I want to mix them together. And then we can put that into the base color. So I'm going to take the color from the Voronoi. And I'm going to put that into color 1. And then I'm going to take this factor from the noise texture. And I'm going to put that into color 2. And then I can Ctrl, Shift, and select the mix RGB to preview it. Now I don't want this to be set to a mix. I want to click on this. And I instead want to change it to darken. And that way it's going to add the dark values. And then on the factor here, I want to turn this all the way up to 1. So you can see if it's turned all the way down, it's only going to be this Voronoi. But then if we turn this all the way up to 1 on the factor, it's going to add that noise there from the noise texture. Now this is still using those colors from the Voronoi. And so I just want to make this gray colors. So to convert these just to gray colors, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for a color ramp node. And let's click on the color ramp. And I'm just going to drop it right here. So the darken is going to go into the factor. So now it's converted just to black and white data. And you can see now it's pretty white. But I do want to make the coal very, very dark. So I'm going to click on this white tab right here. Then I will click on the color. And I'm going to make it a very, very dark color. Even a little bit darker. So just something like that. So we have this very dark coal because coal is pretty dark. So I now want to take the color right here. And I want to put the color into the base color. And then I can Control-Shift and select the principled BSDF. And so now we just have a little bit of variation in the colors because we're using these textures. All right. Now this coal material is very shiny. And so I do want to make it more rough. So what I'm going to do is take the color right here from this Voronoi. And I'm going to put the color into the roughness right here on the principled. And then I want to have more control over this because you can see this is actually pretty shiny. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for another ColorRamp node. And let's just drop the ColorRamp node right in here between the Voronoi and the roughness. So the color is going to go into the factor. And then this ColorRamp color is going to go into the roughness. So if I make the values more white, then it's going to be more rough. And if the values are more dark, it's going to be more shiny. So I can click on this black tab right here. And then I can click on the color. And I can start to make it lighter and lighter. And you can see as I make it lighter, it's more rough. And so I do want to make this pretty light because coal is pretty rough. It's not very shiny. So just something like that is pretty good. All right. Now, even though this is a really dark ColorRamp, and even though this is pretty rough, you're still able to see the coal very well. And it kind of looks gray. And I want it to look much more dark. So what I'm going to do is turn the Specular value down. And that way, it's going to be less reflective. So on the Specular value on the Principled BSDF, I'm going to turn that down to like a 0.15. And that way, it's much darker. You can see that is very dark. All right. So this coal material is looking pretty cool. But I want to add those little chunky bits with the displacement. So to add the displacement, I first need to press Shift-A. And I'm going to go to the search here. And I'm going to search for the displacement node. And let's drop this right down here. Because just like the normal here, this is normal data. And then this is color data. And so I need to add a value into the displacement to actually displace the mesh. But this needs to be displacement data. But then this over here, these nodes here, these are color data and factor data. So the displacement node is going to act as a converter to convert any data to displacement data. So I will bring the displacement node right here under the principled VSDF. And then I can take the displacement and plug that into the displacement on the material output. Now, it's making it really small. And we don't actually have any data in the displacement right now. So what I want to do is mix these two together, kind of like we did right here. I want to mix them together. And then we can put that into the displacement. And that way, these textures will displace the mesh. So what I'm going to do is click on this darken node. And then I'm going to press Control-Shift-D. So Control-Shift-D is going to duplicate the node. But it's going to keep the wires plugged up. And so I'm going to bring this duplicated mixRGB right down here, kind of underneath these bump nodes. And then I'm going to Control-Shift and select the darken to preview it. And now I don't actually want it to be set to darken. I'm going to click on the darken right here. And I'm going to instead change this to add. So right here, I'm going to change this to add. And then also, I want to switch these values because I actually want this Voronoi texture to be on the bottom. So what I'm going to do is take color 1. And I'm going to put that into color 2 instead. And then that way, the noise texture is going to be bumped up into color 1. So the factor is going to go into color 1 on the add. And then the Voronoi color is going to go into color 2 on the add. And then on the factor, right now it's set to 1. But I actually want to change it down to like a 0.5. So it's more of an even blending in between the two nodes. All right, so we've now mixed both of these textures together using this add here. So I now want to plug this into the displacement. So I'm going to take the color. And I'm going to plug that into the height value of the displacement. And that's going to convert it to displacement data. And then I can Control-Shift and select the principal BSDF to preview it. Now, that is way too strong. You can see it's really, really strong. So I'm going to turn this scale right here down to like a 0.3. And now that I've set that to a 0.3, you can see there's all these little chunky bits right there. And that is coming from the Voronoi color. But then there's also a bunch of little roughness right here and noise. And that is coming from this noise texture. And that is it. So that is the finished procedural material. Now, if you're using Blender Eevee and you don't want to use the displacements, I'm also going to be creating another variation of this material on these objects right here that won't be using the displacements. So what I can actually do is I can just click right here and drag. And I can drop this material onto these other objects. Now, I don't actually want to use the displacements on this object. So what I want to do is duplicate this material and then just remove the displacement. So to duplicate this material, I can click on this icon right here. It kind of looks like two pieces of paper. And that is going to duplicate the material, but it's going to keep the same information. So you can now see that it says procedural coal dot 001. I'm just going to rename this to procedural coal, no displacements. Now, to get rid of the displacement, I'm just going to click on this add and press x to delete it. And then click on the displacement and press x to delete it. And there we go. So we now have pretty much the same material, but it just doesn't have the displacement. So now I can put this material on these other objects. So I'm going to click right here and drag and drop it right there. And then I can also click right here and drag and drop this material onto that piece of coal as well. And there we have it. So that is the procedural coal material. So I'll just give this a final render now. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial. And thank you so much for watching. And again, if you'd like to help support me and this YouTube channel, then you can purchase this procedural material on my Gumroad store.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDXGPsrO0_M,Procedural Skin Material (Blender Tutorial),"In the video, the creator addresses audience requests and guides viewers through creating a procedural skin material in Blender. They explain that while procedural methods aren't ideal for realism due to the varying textures of skin across different body parts, they are suitable for stylized or simple characters. The tutorial, conducted in the Cycles render engine but applicable in Eevee, involves using noise and Voronoi textures to create skin color and bumpiness, with subsurface scattering to add realism. Additionally, they suggest combining procedural methods with texture painting for improved realism. The video also promotes the creator's procedural material products and tutorials available for purchase or viewing.","So recently, I've been getting multiple tutorial requests in the comments of my videos, and people have been wanting me to create a procedural skin material. So that's what we're doing in this video. So in this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural skin material in Blender. Now before we start, just a quick disclaimer, if you're going for realism, then using a procedural method really isn't the best way to create it. Because different parts of skin on the body look different. For instance, on the hands, there's little fingerprints, and also on different parts of the hands, there's little wrinkles. And for instance, the skin on the forehead looks different than the skin on the eyelids. So if you're going for realism, then it would actually be better to texture paint the skin and texture paint it correctly for the different parts of the face. But maybe you're not going for realism, maybe you're going for like a stylized character or a cartoony character, or you just want a simple basic material that you can slap on a character, then this material will work great. So I will be doing this tutorial in the Cycles render engine because it is more realistic. But you could also do this in Blender Eevee as well. Here it is in Eevee. And you can see it looks pretty good in Eevee as well. Now something else that you could do if you wanted it to look a little bit more realistic is you could just texture paint the skin color, but then use procedural methods for the bumpiness of the skin. Now if you're going to texture paint a color map for the skin, then it wouldn't technically be procedural anymore. But you could do that if you wanted to get a little bit more realism. So just to show you, I did some very basic texture painting. So I just texture painted the lips here, kind of made some dark areas in the crevices, and also did a little bit of painting on the cheeks, and also made a little bit of a darker area right there above the eyes. And so now if I take this color and I put this color into the base color, and then let me just preview the final thing, you can see that looks much more realistic because the lips are a little bit more of a pinkish color. And so it just looks quite a bit more realistic. And you can see I think that looks pretty good in Eevee as well. And this was pretty easy to texture paint. So if you'd like to learn the basics of texture painting in Blender, then I will have some links in the description to some tutorials on texture painting that I've created. But this is a tutorial on procedural skin, so in this tutorial I will just be using this color ramp here with this noise texture to create a little bit of variation in the skin color. Now just a couple quick things before we get started. If you'd like to help support me and this channel, then you can purchase this procedural material on my Gumroad store, and you also get access to it on my Patreon page. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials. Or if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. All the links are in the description. All right, so let me just show you what I have in the 3D space. So this was a head sculpt that I sculpted a little while ago, and so I just imported this head sculpt into this Blender file to just kind of see how the skin would look on a character's face. And then for the lighting, I added in this plane right here, and I gave it a subsurf modifier, and that way it is round. And then I just gave it an emission material with a strength of 50, just to give some nice bright lighting on the objects. And if you're using Blender Eevee, then the emission shader won't actually emit light. So in Blender Eevee, you could just press Shift-A, go down here to light, and just add a normal light. And then just to help us get a little bit more realistic lighting, right over here on the world, I added in this Machineshop 021K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com, so the link's in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on to preview the different nodes. So if you don't have that enabled, just click on Edit and go to the Preferences, and then over there on the Add-ons tab, you can search for the Node Wrangler and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. So let's create the material now. So I'm going to click on New here, and I can just call this Procedural Skin. And then I'm going to click and drag and drop this material onto this object as well. Alright, so let's press Shift-A now, I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to add a noise texture, because I want to make a little bit of variation within the skin color. And then I'm going to click on the noise texture, and I'm going to press Ctrl-T, that's using the feature of the Node Wrangler, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now we don't really need the mapping, so I can just click on the mapping and press X to delete it, and then let's take the object and put that into the vector. And then using the other Node Wrangler feature, if I hold down the Ctrl and Shift key, I can select different nodes, and that is going to preview the node. So I want to take the factor, and I'm going to put the factor into the base color, and then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the Principled VSDF. Now this doesn't look like skin at all, so I need to change the colors. So to change the colors, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a ColorRamp node. And let's just drop the ColorRamp node right in here, between the Noise Texture and the Principled. So now we can use this ColorRamp to create the skin color that we're going for. And if you'd like to use the exact color that I'm using, then you can click over on the hex value, and you can type in a hex value of E7 8A 6A. So that is the exact color that I'm going to be using. And then I do just want a little bit of variation in here, so I'm first going to click on this black tab, and then I'm going to click on the minus here to get rid of it, and then I'm going to hold down the Control key and click right here, and that's going to add another tab. And I'll just bring this tab over to the other side. And then I'm going to make this tab just a slightly different color than this one. So I'm going to click right here, and then click on the color. And if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using over here on the hex value, you can type in C2 7A 6 3. So those are the colors that I'm going to be using. So it just adds a little bit of variation there in the color. So I can just Control-Shift and select the Principled to preview it. Now to really make it look more fleshy and to really make it look more like skin, we need to add some subsurface scattering. So subsurface scattering is going to allow a little bit of light to go through the material. So if you've ever taken a flashlight and you've shined the flashlight through your hand, you can see that there's some red color coming through your skin, and so that is subsurface scattering. So to turn on the subsurface scattering, we can just change this value right here. So I'm going to change this to a value of 0.07. I don't want to turn it up too high, so I'm just going to add a really small value. And then we need to change the subsurface color. So if I just make this a little bit bigger, you can see it says subsurface color. And I found that a red color is going to look best. So I'm going to change this to a red color. And to use the exact same color that I'm using, you can go over here to the hex and you can type in E7 312E. So now if you look closely at the skin, you can see it just looks a little bit more soft and a little bit more fleshy. Now, if you really want to see what the subsurface is doing, you can turn up the subsurface value and you can see it just makes the material look much more soft and fleshy. And you can really see that it's allowing light to go through the material. You can see that it's really easy to overdo it. So I'm going to keep the subsurface pretty small at a 0.07. So that's looking pretty cool, but I still need to add some bump on the skin to just make it look a little bit bumpy. So to do that, I'm going to take this noise texture right here and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and let's just bring it down here. And then I want to plug the object coordinates up to this. So I'll take the object and put that into the vector and then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. So I'm going to turn the scale here on this second noise texture up to like a 25 and then I'll turn the detail all the way up to 15. So it's very detailed. So I want to put this into the normal. So I'm going to take the factor and let's plug that into the normal, but then I need to convert this to normal data because this is just black and white data, but this needs to be normal data. So to convert it, I'm going to press shift a, let's go to the search here and I'm going to search for a bump node. Let's click on the bump node and I'm going to drop it in between the noise texture and the normal. And then to actually convert this to normal data, we want to take the factor and we want to put that into the height. So now if I control shift and select the bump, you can see it's actually converting it to normal data. And then I can control shift, select the principled BSDF. Now that is way too strong. It's really bumpy. So on the strength value right here, I'm just going to turn the strength way down to a 0.04. So a 0.04. And now if I zoom in here, you can see it's just a little bit bumpy, but it is pretty subtle. All right. Now I also want to add two more layers of bump. So I'm going to press shift day. Let's go to the search here and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. And let's drop the Voronoi texture right down here. And then just like all of the other textures, I want to use the object coordinates and the object coordinates are going to place the texture more evenly on the objects. So I'm going to plug the object up to the vector and then let's control shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. And then for this Voronoi, I'm going to click on the F1 and I'm going to change it to distance to edge. And then I also want to turn the scale up. So I'm going to turn the scale up pretty high to like a 75. So I now want to put this into the bump. So I'm going to take this bump right here and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it. Let's drop it down here. And then I can take the distance and to convert it to normal data, we need to take the distance and put that into the height value. And then to mix multiple bump maps together, we can just take the normal from this bump and we can put it into the normal of the second one. So I can now control shift and select this one. And you can see there it is. And I do want to make it a bit less strong. So let's take the strength value on this one. And I'm just going to turn it down to like a point zero three. So it's pretty subtle, but you can still see it. And then I can also control shift and select this bump. And you can see we're mixing those both together. And then I can control shift and select the final material. Now I do just want to add one more layer of bump. So I'm going to take this Voronoi texture, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it. And let's drop it down here. And again, just like all of the other textures, let's put the object into the vector. And then I don't want this one to be distance to edge. So let's click on this and I'm going to change it back to the F one. And then I can control shift and select this Voronoi to preview it. Now you can see that this Voronoi texture, when you set it to F one, it just adds a bunch of little dots. But I want those dots to be a bit more contrasty. So I'm first just going to press B for the box select, just box select all these nodes and just bring them up. So I have a bit more space. So I want to add a color ramp in here to make those bumps more sharp. So I'm going to press shift a, I'm going to go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. And we can drop the color ramp right down here. And then I want to take the distance from this bottom Voronoi and put that into the factor. And then I can control shift and select this color ramp to preview it. Now to make the bumps more contrasty, I'm just going to take the white tab, and I'm going to drag it out. And I'm going to bring it about halfway somewhere around here. And now you can see that those dots are a bit smaller. So I now want to use this for the bump as well. So I'm going to take this bump node, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it, let's drop it down here. So just like all the other bump nodes, to convert this to normal data, we can just take the color, and we can put that into the height value. And then I can control shift and select this. And if I zoom in there, you can see there's some tiny little bumps there. And I do just want to make it a little bit stronger. So on the strength value right here, I'll just change this to like a point zero five. And then to mix this together with the other bump nodes, I'm just going to take the normal and we're going to put that into the normal. So then I can control shift and select on this one, you can see there is two bump maps together, and then control shift select this one. And you can see there is all three bump maps together. So I can now control shift and select on the principal BSDF to preview the final material. Now, as I talked about at the starting of this video, if you want to, you could go into texture painting, and you could just texture paint a color map. And then you could add that into the base color instead. And so I'll just add that in because I already texture painted this character. So I'm going to press shift a, I'm going to go to the search here. And I'm going to search for an image texture. And I'll drop that down there. And then I can click on the drop down and I'm going to add the skin color. So now instead of using this color map right here with this color ramp, I can use this one instead. So I'll take the color and I'm going to put that into the base color, but I'm still going to use all of the procedural bump. And then I can control shift select this, and you can see that is looking much more realistic because like the lips have a bit of a pinkish color. And again, if you'd like to learn how to do texture painting in blender, I'll have links in the description to my texture painting tutorials. But this tutorial is a procedural skin. So I'll just take the color and plug that back up to the base color. And there we have it. So there's the procedural skin material. So I hope you found this tutorial helpful and thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYw5sbF5bhU,Procedural Clay Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural clay material in Blender, ideal for digital sculpts or clay-like objects. The material works well in both Cycles and Eevee render engines, with Cycles offering more realism. The tutorial covers the process of setting up the material using various textures and nodes to create details like indents and fingerprints, and incorporates lighting and HDRI for realistic reflections. Additionally, the tutorial provides options to purchase the procedural material on Gumroad or access it via Patreon, along with other procedural material packs and tutorials.","In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to create this procedural clay material in Blender. And this is the type of material that you could add onto like a digital sculpt if you wanted to make it look like it was made out of actual clay or just some other clay object. You can see right here this is a digital sculpt that I created a little while ago and it looks really nice with this procedural clay material. And this clay material does work great in both Cycles and Eevee. I prefer using the Cycles render engine because Cycles is a bit more realistic and in Eevee it's slightly laggy in the viewport just because there is a lot of detail there. So I would recommend using Cycles if you want to get a little more realism but as you can see this does look pretty good in Eevee as well. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material then you can purchase it on my Gumroad store and you also get access to the procedural material if you join my Patreon page. And checking out my Gumroad store and Patreon page are great ways to help support me and my YouTube channel.

And if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. Alright so let me just show you what I have in the 3D space. So I pressed shift A and I went right down here and added an Icosphere. And then right behind me on the add Icosphere settings if you open that up I just turned up the subdivisions really high to like a 7 so it's very smooth. And then I just shaded the object smooth. And then also I just imported this sculpture that I did a little while ago. This is a digital sculpt that I created. If you'd like to watch my Blender sculpting tutorials I will also have a link in the description to the playlist where you can check out my different sculpting tutorials. So I just imported this head sculpt into this Blender file just so that we can see what the material would look like on a sculpted head bust. And then to get some nice bright lighting I added this plane and this plane has a subdivision surface modifier on it so that it is circular. And then I just gave it an emission material and I turned the strength up to 50 just to add some nice bright lighting. And then I also wanted some nice realistic lighting and reflections. So right over here on the world I added in this Machineshop 021K HDR. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. Links in the description if you'd like to download it. So right over here on the world you can just add a world and then click over on the color, click on the yellow dot, and you can just add the environment texture and then you can open up the HDRI. And I also just turned the strength down a little bit to a 0.8. And then in this tutorial I will also be using the NodeWrangler add-on. So if you don't have that enabled you can click on edit and open up the preferences and then over there on the add-ons tab you can just search for the NodeWrangler and just check mark the NodeWrangler add-on. Alright so I'm just going to select this object and I'm going to click on new and I'm going to call this procedural clay material. And then I'm going to click and drag right here and I'm going to drop this material onto these other objects. So the head sculpt and then also the eyes for the head sculpt. So to start off I want to add some little subtle indents to make it look like someone was using their thumb or their fingers to kind of push in the clay and kind of shape the clay. So to do that I'm going to press shift A. I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture and let's just drop this down here. And then we turned on the NodeWrangler add-on so you can hold down the ctrl and shift key and then select nodes and that is going to preview the node. Now I also want to select the Voronoi and I'm going to press ctrl T and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. But I don't need the mapping so I can just select it and press x to delete it. And then I want to plug the object up to the vector so that's using the object coordinates. And the object coordinates are going to place the textures on the objects more evenly. Now I don't want those edges to be quite as sharp so right here on the F1 I'm going to instead change this to smooth F1 and now you can see that that is much more smooth. And then you can play around with the smoothness right here by changing the smoothness value but I'm going to turn it all the way up to one because I do want it to be very smooth. And then I'm going to turn the scale on the Voronoi up to like a seven. Now I want to use another texture to distort this texture a little bit just to make it look a little bit more random. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's click on this noise texture and I'm going to drop it right in here between the object coordinates and the vector. And that way this noise texture is going to distort the vector so it's going to distort the placement of the Voronoi texture. Now I don't want it to be distorted this much because that's a lot. I want it to mostly keep its shape. So I'm just going to bring the noise texture down and then I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a mix RGB. Let's just drop the mix RGB right in here after the noise texture. So now what I want to do is I want to take this object here and I want to put this into color one and then this noise texture the color is going to go into color two. So I can now change this factor and that's going to determine how distorted it's going to be. So if you turn the factor all the way up to one you can now see that the Voronoi is very distorted but if you turn it all the way down to zero it's not distorted at all. So I just want it to be distorted a little bit so I'm going to change this value to a 0.06. So just a 0.06 on the factor there on the mix and so it's just a little bit distorted. Now I also want to add a subtle texture for the fingerprints. So to do that I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for a wave texture and let's actually drop the wave texture right down here. So now this Voronoi texture is going to distort the wave texture. So we have the noise texture distorting the Voronoi a little bit and then the Voronoi is going to distort the wave texture. So normally if you unplug this just unplug the distance from the Voronoi you can see the wave texture is just having these waves it's just having these stripes going up and down but if you now take the distance and put that into the vector it's going to use these circles from the Voronoi and it's going to use that to distort it and so now the wave texture is going to be distorted and so those waves are going to be in a circular shape and that looks kind of like fingerprints. Now on the wave texture I'm going to change the bands to rings and then right down here on the scale I just want to turn the scale up to like a 10 so there are more of those rings and then all of these other values I'm going to turn to zero so the detail to zero distortion to zero the detail scale detail roughness and the phase offset just make sure all of these other values are set to zero. All right now that's looking pretty cool but I don't want those fingerprints to be all over the place I just want them to be in some areas so what I'm going to do is press shift A and I'm going to go to the search here and search for a MixRGB and I want to drop the MixRGB right here so now what I can do is I can actually take the distance from the Voronoi and I can put this into the factor and then the wave texture is going to be going into color one and then color two I want to click on this and I'm just going to make this fully white. Now I need to make this factor more contrasty because it's not very contrasty so I'm going to press shift A I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for the color ramp and let's drop the color ramp right in here between the Voronoi distance and the mix factor so right here so now if I start to bring these together it's going to make that more contrasty and as I make it more contrasty you can see that now those fingerprints are only going to be in some places here and there so I'm going to drag the black value to kind of about here and then I'll bring the white value over as well so it's pretty contrasty so now you can see that it looks like there's just some fingerprints and some thumbprints here and there around the clay so I now want to use this texture here to give a little bit of bump into the principle just to make it look like it's slightly bumpy kind of like the fingerprint just kind of made the clay slightly bumpy so I'm going to take the color and I'm going to put that into the normal on the principle and then I need to convert this to normal data because if I control shift and select the principle you can see there's some weird shading issues that's because this is color data but we need to convert it to normal data so I'm going to press shift a I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for a bump node and let's drop the bump node right in here between the mix and the normal and then we want the color to be going into the height and so now that we've converted that to normal data the fingerprint texture is actually bumping in a little bit now it's very very strong right now so I'm going to turn the strength way down to make it a lot more subtle so I'm just going to turn the strength value to like a 0.05 so now if you zoom in here you can kind of see it a little bit but it's very subtle and to be able to see this a little bit better let's actually take the base color and I want to turn the base color down to kind of like a gray color and now you can see that a little bit better so there's just some subtle fingerprints here and there now I also want to add two more layers of bump so I want to add the voronoi into the bump to just make it look like some little parts have been pushed in a little bit and then I also want to add some noise into the bump just to make everything a little bit more noisy so I'm going to select this bump node and I'll press shift d to duplicate it and let's just drop it down here and then I want the normal to be going into the normal and that is how we can add multiple bump maps together by plugging the normal into the normal so I now want to take the factor from the noise texture and I'm going to plug that into the height value of this bump and now you can see that it just has a little bit of bump all over the place so I now want to add the voronoi texture in as well so I'm going to take this bump node and I'll press shift d to duplicate it let's drop it down here and then again the normal can be going into the normal and so now we can add more information into the height value of this bump so what I'm going to do is take the distance from the voronoi I'm going to plug the distance into the height value of this last bump now I do want that to be just a little bit more strong so I'm going to turn this strength value right here to like a 0.07 just that it's slightly more bumpy and then this noise texture actually doesn't have very much detail you can see right there it really doesn't have that much detail so right here on this noise texture I'm going to turn the detail up so I'm going to turn the detail up to like a six so now it has a lot more noise in there you can just see there's all this little noise right there so if I control shift and select this bump node you can see that this is just giving those little indents kind of where your fingers might be pressing in if you're sculpting the clay and then if I control shift and select this bump node right here this is just giving a little bit of noise all over the clay and then if I control shift and select this bump node that is just giving a little bit of fingerprints and you can see that the fingerprints are right where those little indents are because we are using this voronoi texture and this voronoi texture is also distorting the wave texture and so that way where the fingerprints are that's also where the clay is going to be pushing in a little bit so I can now just control shift and select the principled vsdf so I now want to give a little bit of variation in the roughness so I'm going to take the distance from the voronoi texture and I'm going to plug that into the roughness on the principled now I want to have more control over this so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp let's just click on the color ramp and I'm just going to drop the color ramp right down here now I actually want to switch these values so I'm going to drag the black tab over here drag the white tab over there and then just drag the black tab over so the white one's going to be over here and the black one's going to be over here so we can now change the black colors and that is going to change the roughness so if you turn this black tab all the way up it's going to be very rough and so it looks like the clay is much more dried out or if you want to make the clay look more shiny you can turn it much more down to black and when it's more black it's going to be much more shiny and you could also take the white tab and you could drag the white tab down if you want to be very very wet but that is a bit too wet for me I think that is way too wet so I'm going to keep this white tab at all the way to white and then this black tab I can just turn it up a little bit to make it a little bit more rough but I do want it to be pretty shiny I do kind of like that shininess here and there so I'm just going to leave this kind of at a gray color like that all right so this clay material is looking pretty cool but I want to add three different variations of color so I'm going to take the distance from the voronoi and I'm going to plug that into the base color now this doesn't look very good because it's white with little black dots so I want to change the colors so I'm going to press shift a I'm going to go to the search here then I'm going to search for a color ramp and let's drop the color right in here right before the base color so now I can just change these colors to make the different colors that I want so the three variations are going to be a gray colored clay a brown colored clay and then a red colored clay so first I'm going to make the brown one so I'm going to click on this black tab I'm going to click right here and I'm going to make it a bit brighter and then I'm going to make it kind of a brownish kind of orangish color and if you'd like to use the exact same color that I'm using then on this color here you can click over on the hex value and you can type in a hex value of 7a 5d 4c so that is the exact color that I'll be using and then this one right here this is going to be a similar color so I'm going to click on the white tab right here but this one is going to be just a little bit darker and if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using then right over here on this color on the color if you go over to the hex value you can type in 6d 544a so those are the colors that I'm going to be using so that is the first one so that is the brown variation of clay so what I'm now going to do is press shift a I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for a reroute I'm going to click on the reroute and I'm just going to drop it here so I'm now going to take this color and I'm going to put up to the base color kind of bring this down bring this reroute down here and then I'm going to select the reroute and I want to duplicate it so I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it drop it here shift D to duplicate it drop it here and then also I'm going to press b for the box select just box select all of these and just kind of bring them over so we have a bit more space so I'm now going to press shift a I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for a hue saturation node okay so the hue saturation value so what I now want to do is take this color ramp and I'm going to plug this up to this reroute and also up to this reroute and then I'm going to take the hue saturation and I'm going to drop it right in here so that we have this other variation and then I'm going to take this hue saturation I'll press shift d to duplicate it we're going to drop it down here so we can now plug up these three different reroutes and that's going to change the variation of the color now I need to change the colors so let's take this first one here the top one and I'm going to plug this down here so this first one is going to be the gray variation of clay so to make it look gray I'm going to take the saturation and I'm going to turn that all the way to zero and that way it's not going to use any color and then I do want to make it a bit darker so I'm going to take the value and I'm going to turn the value down to like a 0.5 so now it is more gray and you could turn that down if you wanted to make it an even darker gray I like something like 0.5 all right so we have the first variation and that is the gray clay and then if you take this reroute right here and plug that into the base color that is the second variation which is the brown clay so I now want to make one more which is going to be a much more red clay so let's take this reroute we'll plug that into the base color and I can now change these colors so to make it look a little bit more red I want to change the hue so if you change the hue that's going to change the colors so to make it just a little bit more red I'm going to take the hue and I'm going to change that to a 0.48 so a 0.48 is now just going to make that a little bit more red and then I also want to make it more saturated so it's even more red so I'm going to turn the saturation to a 1.3 and that is quite a bit more saturated and then I do also want to make this a little bit darker so I can change the value and that's going to make it brighter or darker so I'm going to turn the value to like a 0.8 just so it's a little bit darker all right so now let me just make this a little bit bigger so you can see it so we now have the gray variation that's looking pretty cool we also have the brown variation and then we also have the red variation and that is the finished material so that is the procedural clay material so that's going to be it for this tutorial thank you for watching

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWT_7jUTW4Q,Procedural Chunky Rock Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural chunky rock material using Blender's node editor, emphasizing the use of the Cycles render engine for displacement effects. The tutorial covers setting up lighting, using Voronoi and Noise textures for rock detailing, and adjusting bump and displacement settings. The creator also discusses options for purchasing the material on Gumroad and accessing more materials via Patreon and material packs. Links for these resources and more tutorials are provided in the video description.","In this Blender tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural chunky rock material. If you'd like to help support me and my YouTube channel, then you can purchase this procedural material on my Gumroad store, and also my patrons over on my Patreon page get access to the procedural materials. And if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials, you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs. So they're packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. And every time I create 10 more procedural materials, then I create another procedural material pack. And also if you'd like to learn how to create more of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. All the links are in the description. Now we are going to be using the displacements in the node editor to make the rock actually be popping out. Now the displacements in the node editor doesn't work in the Eevee render engine, so if you want to use the displacements, then make sure you're using the Cycles render engine when following along with the tutorial. All right, so let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go right down here, and I'm going to add an icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click on the Add Icosphere Settings, I'm going to turn the subdivisions up to like a 5, so it's more subdivided, and then I will close this. And then also using the object context menu, I'm going to shade this smooth. And then to get some nice bright lighting shining on our sphere, I add this plane here, and I just gave the plane a subsurf modifier so that it's round. And then I also give it a bright emission material with a strength of 50, just so that we get some nice bright lighting on this icosphere. And then to make the lighting even more realistic, I also added in this round platform 1K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com, so the link's in the description if you'd like to download it. So I just downloaded the 1K HDR version, and then over here on the world, I just clicked on the yellow dot here next to color, and I just chose environment texture, and then I just opened up the HDRI. And then I'll also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial, so if you don't have that enabled, you can click on Edit and open up Blender's User Preferences, and then over there in the add-ons tab, you can search for the Node Wrangler and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. Now as I said earlier, we are going to be using the displacements in the node editor to actually make the chunky rocks popping out, and so I'm going to be using the Adaptive Displacement. So if you want to use the Adaptive Displacement, then I'll show you how to set it up. So click right over here on the Render Properties, and to use the Adaptive Displacement, we need to change the Feature Set to Experimental. And then we're going to go right down here, and we're going to go to the Modifier Properties, and we're going to click on Add Modifier, and we are going to add the Subdivision Surface Modifier, because that is going to give it more detail. And then if you want to, you can check the Adaptive Subdivision. I'm going to be using the Adaptive Subdivision, and I'm going to turn the Dicing Scale to like a 4. If you don't want to use the Adaptive Subdivision, but you still want to use the displacement, you can totally do that. So in that case, you can just leave this set to Supported, and then right back over here on the Modifier Properties, you can just add the Subdivision Surface Modifier, and that way it's going to give the object more detail, so that it has more geometry to use for the displacement. And then there's just one more thing that we need to do. We need to click right over here on the Material Properties, and then we need to add a new material. Now I'm going to scroll down here, and we need to actually tell the material to use the displacement. So if you open up the Settings right here, you can go down to Surface, and on the Displacement, we want to set this to Displacement and Bump. And that way, it's actually going to use the displacement. All right, so we can now actually do the procedural setup. So I'm going to just rename this to Procedural Chunky Rock. So we're going to start off by making those chunky pieces of rock. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go to the Search, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi Texture, and let's drop the Voronoi down here. And then we turned on the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you select the Voronoi Texture, you can press Ctrl-T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now we don't need the mapping, because the mapping is just going to change the transforms of the object, but we don't really need to do that. We can just leave it how it is. So I'm actually just going to press X to delete that, because we don't need that. And I'm going to take the object and put that into the vector, and the object coordinates will place the texture more evenly around the object. And then I want to be able to preview the Voronoi Texture. So just select the Voronoi, and you can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key, and then click on Nodes. So just hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and select Nodes, and that will preview the node. So we can now preview how that's looking. Now to make it look like chunky pieces of rock, I'm going to click on the F1, and I'm going to change that to Distance to Edge. And you can now see how that's looking. Now I want to make this more random, because you can see it's very straight, and it doesn't look very organic and natural. So I want to use another texture to distort the vector. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to search for a Noise Texture. Let's click on the Noise Texture, and we're just going to drop it in here. So now that the Noise Texture is in between here, it's distorting that Voronoi Texture, and so we now have this result. Now the problem with this is that this is too distorted, and so you can't really see any of the original shape. And so I just want to distort it a little bit. So what I'm going to do is press Shift A, and I'm going to search for a MixRGB. We're going to click on the MixRGB, and I'm going to drop it right in here. So now I'm going to bring the Noise Texture down, and I want to mix these together. So I'm going to take the Object, and I'm going to plug that into Color 1. So on the Texture Coordinate, the Object is going to go into Color 1, and then the Noise Texture is going to go into Color 2. And then I'm actually going to use the Factor instead of the Color, because I think that looks nicer. I think it has a better result. So I'm going to plug the Factor into Color 2. So now I don't want this to be set to Mix. I'm going to click on this right here, and I'm instead going to change it to Add. So we can now play around with the Factor, and that is going to affect how distorted it is. Because if the Factor is turned all the way to 0, it's only going to use Color 1, which is using the normal Object Coordinate. So it's not going to distort it at all. But if I start to turn the Factor up as I turn it up more and more, it's going to use more of that Noise Texture, and so slowly it's going to distort it more and more. Now I don't want it to be very distorted, because I mostly want it to keep the shapes here of these chunky rocks. So I'm going to turn the Factor to a 0.2. That way it's just going to use a little bit of the Noise Texture, but it's mostly going to keep its shape. And now you can see that is much more random and looks more natural and organic. Now I also want to give this Noise Texture some more detail. So let's turn the Detail here all the way up to the max, which is 15, and that's looking much nicer. And then on the Scale here, I'm also just going to turn this up to a 6, so it's a bit smaller. And then also on this Voronoi Texture, I could turn up the Scale a little bit. So I'm just going to turn it up to 6, so that we can see a little bit more of those rocks. Now I want to make it more contrasty, so it's more clear where the rocks are popping out. So I'm going to press B for the Box Select, just click and drag and make a box around these, and then I'll press G to grab and move them back a little bit. So I'm now going to press Shift A, and to make them more contrasty, I'm going to go to the Search here, and I'm going to search for a Color Ramp. Let's click on the Color Ramp, and I'm going to drop it right in here. And then just make sure you Control Shift and select the Color Ramp to preview it. So I can now start to bring these values together, and it's going to make it more contrasty. So I'm just going to bring the black tab out a little bit, but it's going to be pretty close to the end here. And then I'm also going to bring the white tab out quite a bit, kind of to over here, so it's more contrasty. So it's much more clear now where the rocks are, and then the black parts are going to be little crevices in between the rocks. All right, so I can now put this into the Displacement. So I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to search for the Displacement node, because we need some sort of node to convert it to data that it can actually use. Because this needs to be displacement data, but this right here, this is just color data and just black and white data. So the Displacement node is going to convert that to displacement data that the Material Output can actually use to displace the mesh. So I'm going to take the color, and we're going to put the color into the height here of this displacement. And then we want this displacement to go into the displacement on the Material Output. And then I'm just going to Control Shift and select the Principled BSDF just to preview that. So it's way too strong right now. So I'm going to go right here to the Scale Value, and I'm going to turn the Scale Value way down to a 0.025. I find that that looks pretty good, a 0.025. And now you can definitely see that those rocks are popping out, but they're not too crazy. And then also on the Base Color here, I'm just going to make that really dark for now, just that you can see that a little bit better. So you can definitely see there those rocks are popping out. And because I set up the Adaptive Displacement, I can zoom in here. And then to refresh this, I'm just going to double tap the Tab key. That is going to go into Edit Mode, and then it's going to go back into Object Mode. And so it now refreshed it. And so now you can see that as much higher quality, whereas when I was farther here, if I double tap the Tab key, you can see it looks a little bit lower quality. But when it renders, it's going to render with a higher resolution. So that's going to be fine. All right, now I also want this data here to be going into the normal to give the object some bump. So I'm going to plug the color in to the normal. But just like the displacement, this is color data, but this is normal data. And so we need something to convert this to normal data. Because you can see there's some shading issues. There's all these like black areas. So to convert this to normal data, I'm going to press Shift A. Let's go to the search. And I'm going to search for the bump node. Let's click on the bump node. And we're just going to drop it in here between the color and the normal. And then I actually want to take the color and I want to put that into the height value. And now you can see that normal is working correctly. And so the rock now looks much more bumpy. All right, now we haven't really done anything with the color yet. So let's do the color. So I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to search for a noise texture, we're going to use a noise texture to make the colors. So I'm going to just put the noise texture right here. And I'll just put it above the Voronoi. And then let's Ctrl Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And then I also want to use the object coordinates on this noise texture. So let's take the object, we're going to put that into the vector of the noise texture. And then on this noise texture, I do want to turn up the detail. So it's pretty high detail. So I'll turn it all the way up to the max, which is 15. And then let's take the factor from this noise texture. And we're going to put it into the base color. And then I can Ctrl Shift select the principled BSDF. Now that doesn't look very good because it's mostly white. So I want to change the colors in here to make it look more like rock. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift A and let's go to the search here. And I'm going to search for another color ramp. And let's just drop the color ramp right in here. So now that the color ramp is in between these nodes, we can play around with the colors. And that'll change the noise texture colors before going into the base color. So I'm going to leave this value set to fully black. And so I'm going to click on the white tab. And I'm going to make this white tab a bit darker, so it's more gray. And I'm just going to make it some kind of basic gray color or something like that. And if you'd like to use the exact same gray color that I'm using, then you can click over on the hex value. And you can type in a hex value of 626262. So that is the gray color that I'll be using. So that's looking pretty cool. But I want there to be a little bit of brown in between those chunky rocks to look kind of like dirt. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring this color ramp up. And then I'm going to press Shift D to duplicate and I'm going to bring this color ramp down. And then I want to plug the factor into the factor of this color ramp. And then I want to be able to preview this. So I will Ctrl Shift and select it to preview it. So this separate color ramp is going to now be the dirt instead. So I'm going to click on this gray color right here. And I'm going to make this a dark brown color. So I'll bring it over to the orange and then make it pretty dark. And if you'd like to use the same exact brown color that I'm using, then you can click over on the hex value and you can type in a hex value of 22160E. So that is the dark brown color that I'll be using. So now what I want to do is I want some parts to be the dirt and some parts to be the rock. And so I need some sort of factor or mask to tell it where it's going to be the rock and where it's going to be the dirt. So we already have that we can use this right here, this color ramp, because this color ramp has white where it's rock and then black where it's dirt. So I'm going to press Shift A and I'm going to search for a mix RGB because we need to mix these two together these two color ramps. So I'm going to drop the mix right in here. So the first color ramp is going to go into color one. And then I want this color ramp here to be going into color two. And then I can Control Shift and select this mix right here to preview it. So now we need to play around with this factor to tell it where it's going to be dirt and where it's going to be rock. So I can take the color from this color ramp and I'm going to put that into the factor. Now I do want to make it a bit more contrasty because you can see that's not very contrasty. So I'm going to press Shift A and I'm going to search for another color ramp and then I'm going to click on this color ramp and I'm going to drop it right in here between this color ramp and the factor going into the mix RGB. So I'll drop it right here. And let's also pull these nodes kind of down a little bit so that we can see that a little bit better. So now I'm going to make this color ramp even more contrasty. So I'm going to drag the white tab out like that. And then I will also bring the black tab out just a little and I will bring the white tab even closer, something like that. And then let's Control Shift and select the Principled BSDF to preview that. Now you can see that it's actually flipped the wrong way around because the brown is right here on the rocks and then the gray is kind of in the cracks. So a really easy way to fix this is just to switch color 1 and color 2. And there we go. So you can now see that we have that little dirt there in the crevices and then the rest of it is the rocks. And if you want to make this more contrasty you can. So you can play around with these values to change that. So that's looking pretty cool but there is one more thing I want to do. You can see the dirt is very very smooth and there's also some places on the rocks where it's very smooth. And so I want to give this entire material one more layer of bump. So I'm going to click on this bump node and I'll press Shift D to duplicate it and we're just going to drop it right here. So the normal can go through the normal so we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So I'm going to take the factor from this noise texture and I'm going to plug that into the height and that way it's going to give it some bump. So now you can see that that noise texture is bumping that out and so it looks bumpy all over the place. Now that is a bit too bumpy that is like super super bumpy so I'm going to turn the strength down to just like a 0.4 on this last bump and that way it's still bumpy but it's not quite as bumpy. But now you can see there's lots of noise all over that material. And then there's just one other thing you could do if you want everything to be a bit more rough you could turn up the roughness value if you want things to look a bit more rough or if you want them to look a little bit more wet and shiny you could turn the roughness down. I'm just going to leave the roughness at a 0.5 because I like how that looks. All right so that is it so that is the finished procedural material and there is the final render. So that is going to be it for this tutorial so thank you for watching and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I hope you found it helpful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCyUt1Jaufk,Procedural Smooth Concrete Material (Blender Tutorial),"In the Blender tutorial, the instructor demonstrates how to create a procedural smooth concrete material using Blender's procedural nodes. The tutorial covers steps such as adding textures like Musgrave and Voronoi, utilizing Node Wrangler features, and adjusting settings to achieve realistic concrete appearance with lighting and reflections. The instructor also mentions available resources, including tutorial files on Gumroad, procedural material packs, and additional learning materials on YouTube and Patreon, offering links in the video description for further exploration and support.","In this Blender tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural smooth concrete material in Blender. Now, if you'd like to purchase the tutorial files, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store, and you also get access to the procedural material if you join my Patreon. And also, before we start, this video was brought to you by my Blender procedural material packs, so I create packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. So if you'd like to purchase the procedural material packs, I'll have the links in the description where you can purchase on my Gumroad store. So checking out my procedural material packs, as well as my Gumroad and Patreon, is a really great way to help support me and my YouTube channel. And if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. Again, the links are in the description. So let me just show you what I have in the 3D space. So I just added a monkey head, and I subdivided it and shaded it smooth. And then I also added this icosphere here, a subdivided icosphere, and shaded that smooth as well. And then I also added this cube here with a bevel on it. But you can, of course, add your procedural material to any object that you want. And then also to get some nice lighting, I added in this plane right here. And then on this plane, I added an emission material, and I just turned up the strength to make it very bright, and that way we have some nice, bright lighting shining on the objects. And then also to get some nice lighting and reflections, I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDR. And this is from polyhaven.com. So if you'd like to download the HDRI, I'll have the links in the description. So in the world here, I just clicked on the yellow dot here, and I added this in as an environment texture and opened up the HDRI. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial. So if you don't have that enabled, just click on Edit and open up the Preferences. And then over on the Add-ons tab, you can search for the Node Wrangler and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use the add-on. All right, so I'm going to select this object, I'm going to click on New, and I can just call this Procedural Smooth Concrete. So to start off, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go to the Search here, and I'm going to search for a Musgrave texture. Let's just drop the Musgrave texture right here. And then we turned on the Node Wrangler add-on, so if you select the Musgrave texture, you can press Ctrl-T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate mapping. And then I don't need the mapping because that is just going to change the transforms of the Musgrave texture. I'm just going to click on the mapping and press X to delete it. And then I want to use the object coordinates, so I'm going to plug the object up to the vector, and the object coordinates are going to place the texture on the objects more evenly. And then using the other feature from the Node Wrangler, I'm going to hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on different nodes, and that is going to preview the node. And then I didn't add this procedural material to these other objects right here, so I'm going to click right here, and I'm going to drag and drop this material onto these other objects. Alright, now I'm going to turn the scale down to 2 so that it is smaller, and then I'm also going to turn the detail up to like a 9.5, so we have some more details there. You can especially see it on the edges there. And then I'm going to turn the dimension all the way down to 0, and when we turn the dimension down, you can see now it has so much more detail there, and that's looking really nice. Now I'm also going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's drop the Voronoi right here, and then again I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on different nodes to preview them. And then I want to take the object and put that into the vector, and that way it's going to use the object coordinates for the mapping of the Voronoi as well. Now for the scale here, I'm going to turn the scale up, and I'll turn it up to like a 16 on the Voronoi. So now what I want to do is I want to mix these two together, so I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a MixRGB, and let's drop the MixRGB right here. And then I'm going to take the Musgrave texture, and this is going to be the main texture, so I'm going to put this into color 1, and then I'm also going to Ctrl-Shift and select the mix to preview it. And then I'm going to use the Voronoi texture as the factor to mix color 1 and color 2 together. So we're going to take the distance from the Voronoi, and we're going to put that into the factor. And now if you zoom in here, you can kind of start to see what's happening. Let's take color 2, and let's make it a bit darker. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, then you can click over on the hex value, and you can type in a hex value of 959595. So that is the color that I'll be using. So if you zoom in here, you can kind of see what it's doing. So we're using this Voronoi texture as the factor to tell it where it's going to be color 1 and where it's going to be color 2. So if you Ctrl-Shift and select the Musgrave texture, and then Ctrl-Shift select the mix, you can go back and forth between these, and you can see that result. Now I also want to give this whole thing some more noise, so I'm going to press Shift-A, and let's search for the noise texture. And I'm going to drop the noise texture right here, and I'll just drop it up here. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And then again, I want to use the object coordinates, so I'm going to plug the object into the vector. Now on the scale, I'm just going to turn this to like a 3. And then I want there to be a lot of detail, so I'm going to turn the detail on the noise all the way up to the max, which is 15. So now I want to add this noise texture into the final color. So to do that, I'm going to take this mix, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it. Let's drop it up here. And then I'm going to take the factor from this noise texture, and I'm going to put that into color 2. And then I'm going to take the mix from this color, and I'm going to put that into color 1. So I can now Ctrl-Shift and select this to preview it. And then I just want to add the light values, so I'm going to click on this mix here, and I'm going to change it to lighten. So it's right down here, click on lighten, and now it's just going to add those light values. So again, I can go back and forth between this mix and this mix, so Ctrl-Shift and select this, and Ctrl-Shift and select this, and you can see that result. So we now have little bits of noise all around there. So this is the main texture that we're going to use for the concrete, but I do want to change the colors because the colors aren't very good. Some parts are really bright, and some parts are like super black. So to change the colors, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a ColorRamp node, and let's just drop the ColorRamp node right here. So now we can change these colors, and that's going to change the colors of the texture. So I'm first going to click on this white tab right here, and then I'll click on the color, and I'm going to make this a bit darker because I do want everything to be a bit more gray. So I'll make that a bit darker, and then also, it does sometimes seem like concrete just looks very, very slightly blue, so I'm just going to make this very, very slightly blue. And if you'd like to use the exact same color that I'm using, then the hex value that I'll be using is 6C6D71. So it's a gray color with just a very, very tiny little amount of blue. And then I don't want the concrete to be that black, so I'm going to click on this tab right here, and then click on the color, and I'm going to make that a bit brighter. And if you want to use the exact same hex value that I'm using, then you can type in a hex value of 535353. So now you can see that texture there is looking a lot more like concrete, and the colors look much more like concrete. So I can take the color, and I can plug that into the base color, and then I can control shift and select the principle to preview that. We can see how that is looking. So now I want to add a little bit of imperfections and make it look like there are some little cracks or chunks out of the concrete. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A, and let's search for another Voronoi texture, and I'm going to drop this here. And then I can control shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. Now I want to distort it because I don't want it to just look like these little dots. So I'm going to take the color from the noise texture, and I'm going to put that into the vector of the Voronoi. And that way it's going to use the noise texture to distort the Voronoi texture. And so now you can see that that Voronoi texture is all distorted, so it's not those little dots, it's now this cool distorted texture. You can see that is looking really cool. And then I do want to be able to see a lot more of that, so on the scale here on the Voronoi, I'm going to change the scale to a 25. So now you can see we have a really cool texture there. Now I want to change the colors, so I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Let's click on this color ramp, and we're just going to drop it right in here. So the distance will go into the factor, and then you can just control shift and select the color ramp. Now I want to switch these values, so I'm going to click and drag and bring this over, and then click and drag and bring this white over. So the white is going to be over here, so it's actually mostly going to be black. And I'm going to drag the black tab over so that most of it is black, and there's just a few spots here and there that are white. And then I don't want it to be fully white because that's like really bright, so I'm going to click on this white tab, and I'm going to make it a little bit darker. And the hex value that I'm using for this one is six C's. So CC, CC, CC. That is the exact gray color that I'll be using. So now I want to take all these little imperfections, and I want to put that into the base color. So I'm going to click on one of these mix RGBs. This one is set to lighten. I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it, and I'm going to drop it right here. So we can now use this mix RGB to mix in this texture here. So I'm going to take this color, and I'm going to put that into the factor. And then I just want to add the dark values. So instead of lighten, I'm going to click on this, and I'm going to change it to darken. And then I'm also going to control shift and select it to preview it. And then color two right now is just this gray color, and so I need to make it all the way black. And now that it's black, you can see that we have all those little imperfections and cracks there. So we are using this texture right here as the factor to tell it where it's going to be color one and where it's going to be color two. So color one is this texture, but then color two is the black color. So I can now control shift and select the principle to preview it. So I do want to create one more layer of textures, and then add that into the concrete. And that's going to be some little dots to look like some little pebbles and rocks which are in the concrete. So to do this, I'm going to press shift a and let's search for one more voronoi texture. And I'm going to drop this one above the noise texture, and then I can plug the object into the vector again, so that we're using the object coordinates. And then I can control shift and select it to preview it. Now for this one, I want the dots to be very small. So on the scale here, I'm just going to change this to like a 50. So we have a bunch of little dots. Now I want to make these dots sharper because you can see some of them are kind of going into each other. So I want to make it much more sharp and more contrasty. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search here for another color ramp. Let's click on the color ramp and then just drop it right here. So the distance from the voronoi is going to go into the color ramp and then just control shift and select the color ramp to preview it. Now I want to switch these values. So I'm going to drag this black tab out. And I'm just going to drag this black tab to about here. And then I'm going to drag the white tab all the way over. And now you can see that it's mostly black, but just here and there, there are those sharp dots and the edges are much sharper. Now I don't want these little dots to be all over the place. I just want them to be in some spots here and there. So what I'm going to do is bring this color ramp up and then I'm going to press shift D to duplicate, and I'm going to duplicate this color ramp and bring it down. So we're just going to have this color ramp above this one. And why I'm doing that is because I'm going to use this noise texture right here to tell it where those little dots are going to be. But if I control shift and select this noise texture, you can see that it's not very contrasty at all. And so I want to make it much more contrasty. So I'm going to take the factor from this noise texture and I'm going to put it into the factor, the color ramp, and then I can control shift and select it to preview it. Now it's all black right now, and that is because I need to drag this out. So I'm going to drag this way out, and then I'm going to bring the white tab much farther over just like that. So now it's a much more contrasty. And so now where those white parts are, that is where this Voronoi texture is going to show up. So what we need to do is we need to mix these together. So I'm going to take one of these mix RGBs. I can just take one of these. So I'm just going to grab the darken and I'll press shift D to duplicate, and I'm going to drop it right here. And then I don't want it to be set to darken. So I'm just going to change it back to the default, which is mix. So I'm now going to take this color ramp, this top one here, and I'm going to put the color into color two. And so this one up here, this one is the dots, and then I can control shift and select the mix to preview it. Now I want to control where the dots are going to show up. So we're going to use this color ramp here as the factor. So the color is going to go into the factor. So just put the color into the factor and then just control shift and select the mix to preview it. So now color one is going to be fully black. So just make it fully black. And now you can see that that is much more random. So those dots aren't everywhere. They're just in some spots here and there, and that looks much more natural and organic. So we can now mix this in with our final material. So I'm going to select this darken and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it. And I'm just going to drop it right here. And then let's just bring these out over here. So I can now use this darken and add in this texture. So I'm going to take this color here and I'm going to put that into the factor of this darken. And then this darken here from the original texture, that was going to go into color one, and then color two is going to be fully black. So now if I control shift and select the darken, you can zoom in here and you can see that those dots are showing up. They're only in some spots here and there. So I can control shift and select this, and then control shift and select this. And you can see how that is changing the texture. So let's just control shift and select the principal BSDF to preview how that's looking. So that is looking pretty cool. It's starting to look a lot like concrete, but there's still two more things that I want to do. I want to add some data into the normal here to give it some bump. And then I also want to play around with the roughness value as well. So let's first do the roughness. So I'm going to take the color right here, this final color, and I'm going to put that into the roughness. Now I want to be able to control that better because you can see this is looking super shiny and concrete is not that shiny. So to control these values, I'm going to press shift A. And again, we're going to search for another color ramp. So I'm going to click on this color ramp and I'm just going to drop it right in here. So the color will go through the factor of the color ramp, and then that is going to go into the roughness. So if I make this texture lighter, it's going to be more and more rough, but if it's darker, it's going to be more and more shiny. So to make it lighter, you can click on this black one here and you can click on this color and you can see if I turn it up, it's going to be more and more rough. So I'm going to turn this up to a much brighter color so that concrete looks much more rough. And the hex value that I'll be using for this one is B2, B2, B2. So that is the roughness value that I'm going to use. All right. So this is starting to look like concrete, but I do just want to give it a little bit of bump. Even though it is a smooth concrete, it still is going to have a little bit of bumpiness over the surface. So I'm going to be adding in four layers of bump. So I'm going to press shift A and we want to search for a bump node and let's drop the bump node right here. So what I'm first going to do is I'm going to take this Musgrave texture and put that into the normal. So I'm going to take the height and I'm going to put that all the way over here into the normal on the principled BSDF. Now we need to convert this to normal data because you can see the shading looks really weird and that is because this is black and white data, but in order for the normal to work, it needs to have normal data. So that is where this bump node comes in. So the bump node will convert this data to normal data. So we're just going to drop the bump node right in here. And then the height value isn't going to go into the normal. It's going to go into the height. So the Musgrave texture is going to go into the height and then that bump node will convert it to normal data. And that's going to go into the normal. So you can now see we have all this detail in there. Now that is way too strong. So on the strength here, I'm just going to change this to like a 0.1, so it's less strong. But if you zoom in there, you can still see there's a lot of bump there. So I now want to add in three more layers of bump. So I'm going to click on this bump node and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and let's drop it right here. So the normal can go into the normal. So we now have this extra height value that we can add data into. So the next one that I'm going to add is the noise texture. So I'm going to take the factor from the noise texture and I'm going to plug that into the height on the bump. And that way it's going to add a little bit of noise all over the concrete. Now it isn't that strong. You're not really able to notice too much. So I'm going to turn the strength up to a 0.13 and that way it's going to be more strong. So if you kind of look right over there, you can definitely see that taking effect. So if you control shift and select this bump, you can preview that and then I can control shift and select this. And you can see that is definitely doing something. So it's making it bumpy. All right. So I still want to add two more layers of bumps. So I'm going to click on this bump node and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and let's drop it right down here. So again, this normal can go into the normal. So we now have this extra height value. So for this next one, I want to use this one right here, the little imperfections on this Voronoi texture. So with this texture here, this color ramp, I'm going to take the color and I'm going to plug that into the height of this bump node. So the color is going to go into the height and then I can control shift and select the bump to preview that. Now I don't want it to be popping out. If you zoom in here, it kind of looks like it's popping out. Instead, I want it to look like it's going in to make it look like there are little chunks and cracks and things. So I'm going to click on the invert button and that way, instead of that bump coming out, it's going to go back in and then it isn't very strong and I want to make it just a little bit more strong. So I'm going to turn the strength up to a 0.15 and that way it's just a little bit more strong. So I just want to add one more layer of bumps. So I'm going to click on this bump and I'll press shift D to duplicate it. We're just going to drop it right here. Now for the last layer of bump, I want to use this right here. I want to use these little dots here, which look like little rocks and pebbles and more imperfections. So I'm going to take the color from this mix and I'm going to plug the color into the height value on this last bump. So if I control shift and select this to preview it and zoom in here, you can see it's adding in those little bumps right there. So I can now control shift and select the principled BSDF to preview the final material. And there is the final render. So that is going to be it for this tutorial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqfcV56SHMc,Procedural Dirty Metal (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural dirty metal material, highlighting the use of various nodes such as Musgrave and noise texture, along with techniques to adjust color and roughness. The video also mentions resources available for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon, offers other procedural material packs, and suggests additional tutorials for further learning. A sponsorship by Blender Grid is noted, offering render services specifically for Blender users. The tutorial concludes with a brief showcase of the final rendered material and a call to support the creator through various platforms.","In this tutorial, I will show you how to create this procedural dirty metal material in Blender. If you'd like to help support me and this channel, then you can purchase this procedural material on my Gumroad store, and also my patrons on my Patreon page get access to the tutorial files. And to purchase more of my procedural materials, you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs. And after this tutorial, if you'd like to learn how to create more procedural materials, then you can check out my procedural material tutorial playlist. All the links are in the description. And then one other thing before we get started, I want to give a huge thanks to Blender Grid for sponsoring this video. Blender Grid is an easy to use render firm specifically designed for Blender. I've used the service and I highly recommend it. Upload your Blender file or a zip file with the Blend file and textures. You can change the render settings on the website before rendering. Blender Grid will let you know the cost before you start the render. You can even choose when you want the render to finish if you're on a tight deadline. While it renders, you can check the rendered frames to make sure everything is rendering properly. Once it finishes, just download the files and compile the frames in a video editor. Use the link in the description to get $20 of render credit on your first render. So before we set up the material, I'm just going to show you how I have set up the Blender file. So I pressed shift A and I went down here and added an icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click on the add icosphere settings right there, I've just subdivided it. So I just turned up the subdivisions and then I just shaded the object smooth. So we have a nice smooth sphere to preview our material on. And then I also added this light right here. So this is just a normal sunlight. Um, and I turned up the strength to 15 and I just made it a very, very slight yellow color. And then to get some very nice lighting and reflections, I added in this artist workshop HDRI. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com links will be in the description if you'd like to download it. So I just downloaded the one K HDR version, and then I added this in as an environment texture into the world. And that way we will have some nice lighting and reflections on this object. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add on in this tutorial. So to enable the add on, you can just click on edit and then open up Blender's user preferences. And then under the add ons tab, if you search for the node wrangler, you can just check Mark the node wrangler add on. So let's create the material now. So I'm just going to select this object and then I'll just click on new and I can just call this procedural dirty metal. All right. So to start off, I'm going to press shift day and I'm going to search for a Musgrave texture. Let's drop the Musgrave texture right here. And then using the feature from the node wrangler add on, I can hold down the control and shift key and then select nodes to preview the node and then just make sure the Musgrave is selected. And I'm going to press control T again, that's using the node wrangler feature, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now, the mapping node is just used to change the location, rotation and scale of the texture, but we don't want to do that. So I'm going to click on the mapping and press X to delete it. So I want to use the object coordinates. So I'll plug the object up to the vector of the Musgrave and using the object coordinates is going to place the texture more evenly on the objects. So I'm going to turn the scale up to an 8.5 so that you can see more of that Musgrave texture. And then I will turn the detail all the way up to the max, which is 15. So we now have little bits of detail in there on the edges. And then I can also turn the dimension down. And when I do that, you can now see that we have all that little grainy detail there on the texture. And then also I'm going to click on this bottom dropdown right here, and I'm going to change it to a multifractal. I do think that looks much better for what we're creating. Now let's plug the height into the base color. So that'll actually affect the base color. And then let's control shift and select the principle to preview it. And then because this is metal, I want to turn the metallic value all the way to one. So it treats it as a metallic material. And then we can also turn this roughness down a little bit just to kind of see how that's looking. So that is looking pretty cool, but I want to change the colors because right now this is just kind of black and white, and I want to make it look more like metal. So I want to make it look a bit more gray. And also I want to give it a little bit of brown. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to add a color ramp node, and we can click on this color ramp node. And I want to put the color ramp in between the Musgrave and the base color. So I'll just drop it in here. So we can now change these colors in between here, and that'll change the colors for the texture. So I'm just going to hold down the control and shift key and then select this to preview it. So I'm first going to click on this white tab here. I'm going to select that and then click on the color. And I want to make this more of a gray color so that it looks more like metal. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, then you can go over to the hex value right here in the colors, and on the hex value, you can type in nine, six times. So that is the exact gray color that I'll be using. Now for this black one, I do want it to be pretty black, but I want to make it just a little bit brighter. So I'm going to click on the black tab, and I'll just turn this up a little bit. And then I want to make it just slightly brown. I think that looks pretty nice for kind of a dirty metal. And again, if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, then over here on the hex value, you can type in 403B39. So that is the exact color that I'll be using. So let's control shift and select the principle. And you can see that is looking pretty nice. Now I want to give some more detail to this. So I'm going to press shift day, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And let's drop the noise texture right down here. And then I also want to use the object coordinates. So on the texture coordinate here, I'm going to plug the object up to the vector. And that way, this noise texture will use the object coordinates as well. And then let's hold down the control and shift key and select the noise texture to preview it. Now on the scale here, I'm going to turn this to like a 9.5. So we can see a bit more of that. And then I will turn the detail all the way up to the max, which is 15. And then if you zoom in here, I want to give it a little bit more roughness. So I'm just going to turn the roughness up to like a point six. So now there's just a bit more roughness and a bit more detail there. I'm also going to use the box select by hitting B. And I'm going to drag a box around these nodes and just bring them out a little bit. So we have a little bit more space. All right, now I want to plug this noise texture into the roughness so that some parts of the metal are a little bit more shiny. And then some parts are a little bit more rough. But I also want this Musgrave texture to affect the roughness a little bit as well. So I want to mix these two textures together. And then I'll plug that into the roughness. So to mix them together, I'm going to press shift day. And I'm going to search for a mix RGB. And let's drop the mix RGB right here. And then I want to plug the noise texture factor into color two. And then I want to plug the Musgrave texture, the height here, I want to plug that into color one. And then let's Ctrl Shift and click on the mix to preview it. Now I only want to add the dark values. So I'm going to click on this mix here, and I'm going to change it to dark. And that way, we are just going to add the dark values. And then on the factor here, I'll turn this all the way up to one. Now the noise texture is pretty gray, it's not very contrasty. And so I do want to make it more contrasty. So I'm going to press Shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. Let's click on this color ramp node. And I want to drop it in here between the noise texture and the mix. And that way we can change the colors and make it darker. So if I Ctrl Shift and select the color ramp, I can preview that. And I just want to take the black tab and I want to drag it out. And you can see that as I drag it out, it's becoming more and more black. So I'm just going to drag the black tab over there. And now you can see that that is quite a bit more dark. So I can Ctrl Shift and select the darken. And you can now see that there's some little dark areas on that noise texture. So let's now take the color and let's put that into the roughness right there. So the mix RGB right here set to darken, the color is going to go into the roughness so that it'll control where it's going to be more rough and where it's going to be more shiny. So I can now Ctrl Shift and select the principal to preview that. Now you can see that this is very contrasty. Some parts are like really rough, but then other parts are really, really shiny. So I want to be able to control that a bit better. So it's not so contrasty, because some parts are really rough, and then some parts are really shiny. So to control that, I'm going to press Shift A and I'm going to search for another color ramp. And let's drop this color ramp right in here. So we're going to put that color ramp in between the darken and the roughness. Now, if I take this white tab, and I start to turn it down, everything is going to be more shiny. So if it's darker, it's going to be more shiny. So I do want to make everything just a little bit more shiny. So I'm going to turn this down a little bit. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, then on the hex value, you can type in BE BE BE. So that is the exact color that I'll be using. So you can see now the metal is much more shiny. Now it is a little bit too shiny all over the place. And so I do want to make some of it a bit more rough. So I'm going to click on the black tab, and I'm going to click on this color. So if you make it darker, it's going to be more shiny. So if you make it lighter, it's going to be more rough. So you can see as I turn this up, the metal is much more rough now, but I don't want it to be that rough. I still want it to be pretty shiny because it is metal. So I'm going to make it a bit darker. And the hex value that I'll be using for this one is going to be five, six times. So five, five, five, five, five, five. So that is the exact color that I'll be using. So you can see now some of it's a bit more shiny, some of it's a bit more rough, but it's not too contrasty. All right, so this material is almost finished, but I do want to add just a little bit of bump because this is kind of a rough metal. So I'm going to take the factor right here on this noise texture, and I'm going to plug that into the normal, and that way it'll give it some bump. Now this is a black and white data because it's a gray, it is a factor, and this is normal data. So we need to convert this data to normal data so that it can work with the principle. So to convert that, we're going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a bump node. We're just going to drop the bump node right in here. So that way the noise texture factor is going to go into the height. We actually want to plug this into the height instead, and that way it can actually use this data and convert it to normal data. Now you can see that it's way too strong. That is like super, super rough, and I do not want it to be that bumpy. So on the strength here, I'm just going to turn this to a 0.03. That way, if you zoom in here, you can see that the metal is very, very rough, kind of all over the surface, but it's not too crazy. And that is it. So that is the procedural dirty metal material. And here is the final render. So this is going to wrap it up for this tutorial. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and I hope it was helpful. And thank you so much for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bl4VhVcD4,Procedural Crystal Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural crystal material, offering two versions: one with displacement for a textured mesh and one without. They explain the setup process, detailing how to use nodes for transparency, bump mapping, and color customization with a custom node featuring color presets. The tutorial also discusses enabling displacement in Blender's settings, noting that displacement won't work in Eevee. Additionally, the creator provides information on purchasing the material and supporting their work through Gumroad or Patreon, and offers more learning resources via their YouTube playlist.","Hello, everyone, and welcome to another procedural material tutorial. So in this one, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural crystal material in Blender. And we're going to be creating two different versions of this crystal material. So we're going to be creating one with a displacement, so that it actually displaces the mesh and has this very cool texture. And then the other one is going to be exactly the same, but just without the displacement. So I'll be modeling this simple crystal material, and then we will have that. So we'll have two versions, the displacement and no displacement. Now, just something to note here, the node editor displacements won't work in Eevee. So if you're using Blender Eevee, then this isn't going to work. But this material does still look pretty cool in Blender Eevee. And another really cool thing about this material is that we're going to be creating this custom node here with some color presets. So you'll just be able to create these different colors, create some different color presets that you like. And then you can just plug them up to the base color to get all these different colors. Now, if you'd like to purchase the procedural material, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store. I'll have the links in the description. And also, if you join my Patreon, then you'll get access to the procedural material. And that is a really great way to help support me and this YouTube channel. And speaking of supporting the channel, this video was brought to you by my Blender procedural material packs. So every time I create 10 more procedural materials, then I create another Blender procedural material pack. And so if you'd like to check out those procedural material packs, the links will be in the description. And purchasing the packs is a great way to help support me and my YouTube channel. And also, if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. Again, the links will be in the description. All right, so let's model those objects. And then I'll also show you what I have set up in the 3D space real quick. So I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to go here to Mesh. And I'm going to add an Icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click over on that Add Icosphere tab right here, you can turn up the subdivisions. So I'm going to turn these subdivisions up pretty high because I do want to use the displacements. So I'll turn it up to like a 6 or a 7. You could probably just go with 6. Or if that's a little bit too high, you could turn it down a little bit. All right, I'll move this over to the side. And then also using the Object Context menu, I'm going to shade this object smooth. So let's now just model a simple crystal object. So I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to go right down here and add a circle. And then again, right behind me, if you click on the Add Circle Settings right there and open up that tab, I'm going to change the vertices to a value of 8. So it is much more low poly. And then I can close this. Let's also bring this out of the way. I'll tab into Edit Mode on this object right here. And I'm going to scale the whole thing down. Now I want to fill a face here. So I'm going to press F, and that will fill a face. And then I'm going to press E, and E is going to extrude this out. And I'll bring this up kind of high like that. And then I'll also scale it up just like that. Then I'll press E to extrude. We're going to extrude that even more. And then with all of this top area selected, I'm going to press the M button. And I want to merge all of these at center. And that way, it's going to merge them all together into one single point. All right, that is good. So I'm going to double tap the A key in Edit Mode, and I'll press Shift D. We're going to duplicate everything, and I can scale it down and rotate it over. Just put that into place. And then I'll press Shift D again. That will duplicate the mesh. And I'm just going to stick that right there. And there we have it. So those are the two objects that I'll be using to preview the material. And then also to get some nice lighting, I added in these two planes right here. And I gave these planes a bright emission material. And that way, there's going to be some bright lights shining on the objects. Now to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections over here on the world, I added in this Machineshop 021K HDR. And this is from polyhaven.com. So the link's in the description if you'd like to download this HDRI. So I just clicked on the color dot right here, this yellow dot. And I changed this to an environment texture, and then opened up the HDRI to get some nice lighting and reflections. All right, let's get started with the node setup. So I'm just going to select this object, and I'll just click on New. And I can just call this Procedural Crystals. And then I'm going to click right here and drag and drop this material on that other object as well. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial. So if you don't have that add-on enabled, just click on Edit and go to Blender's User Preferences. And then over there in the Add-ons tab, you can just search for the Node Wrangler and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. All right, so now that we have that turned on, let's get started. So I first want to make this look kind of transparent and be able to see through it. So I'm going to turn this transmission value up. So I'm going to start to turn it up. And you can see when I start to turn it up, now it's kind of looking more like glass. Now, I don't want to see all the way through this, but I want to be able to see through most of it. So I'm going to turn this transmission to a 0.91. And that way, you're able to see through this quite a bit. And it looks kind of like a glass or a crystal material. And then we can also turn the roughness down a bit, just so that we can see through it a little bit better. But we will be adding some values into the roughness later on. Now, I want to give this material just a little bit of bump all over the place. So I'm going to press Shift-A. And let's search for a noise texture. And I'm going to drop the noise texture down here. And then we turned on the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you hold down the Control and Shift key, you can select nodes. And that will preview the node. Now, also with the noise texture selected, I'm going to press Control-T. And that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now, we don't need the mapping node. So I'm just going to select it and press X to delete it. And then I want to use the object coordinates. So I'm going to plug the object into the vector on the noise texture. And then on the scale here, let's turn the scale down. So I'm going to turn the scale down to a 1.7. And then also, I do want this to have quite a bit more detail. So I'll turn the detail value all the way to the max, which is 15. Now, I want to take this data, and I want to put it in the bump. So let's take the factor. And we're going to put that into the normal to give it some bump. Now, I need to convert this to normal data, because this is black and white data. But this needs to be normal data. So I'm going to press Shift-A. And let's search for a bump node. And we can use the bump node to convert that to normal data. So I'm going to drop the bump right here. And then the factor from the noise texture is going to go into the height of the bump. So let's now Control-Shift and select the principle. And you can see that is now looking nice and bumpy. Now, it's way too strong right now. It kind of looks like a rock material. And that's way too strong and bumpy. So on the strength value, I'm just going to change this to like a 0.1. And now, if you zoom in there, you can see there's just a tiny little noise and a little bit of bump there. But it is pretty smooth. Now, I do want to add some stronger bump. But I just want that to be in a few places here and there. So I'm going to select this noise texture. And I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it. And let's drop it down here. And then I can Control-Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Let's also bring this texture coordinate down. And I want to plug the object into the vector so that it's using the object coordinates. And that'll place the texture on the object more evenly. So I'm going to turn the scale of this noise texture to a 7 so it's much bigger. Now, I want to make this more contrasty because it's really not that contrasty. It's pretty gray. So I'm going to press Shift-A. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's drop the color ramp right in here. So after the noise texture, let's just bring these over and bring the color ramp over. So I want the factor to be going into the color of the color ramp. And then just Control-Shift and select the color ramp to preview it. So I can now drag this out. And that's going to make it more contrasty. So if I drag both of these values together, you can now see that it's very contrasty. So now we are going to put this into the bump as well. So let's take this bump node. And I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it. And we're just going to drop it here after the first bump. So the normal can go through the normal. So we now have this extra height value that we can plug data into. So let's take the color from the color ramp. And we're going to put that into the height. And then just Control-Shift and select this to preview it. So you can see we are now adding both of these bump maps together. And if you Control-Shift and select the principled, you can now see that there are some parts where it's more bumpy. Now, I do think this is a little bit too bumpy. It may not be that easy to see right now. But I do think it's a bit too bumpy. So on the strength here, I'm just going to turn this down to a 0.06 so that it is a bit less bumpy. Now, I also want this noise texture to affect the roughness. So let's take this factor here. And we're going to plug the factor from the bottom noise texture into the roughness value on the principled. Now, I want to be able to control that better. So I'm going to press Shift-A. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's just drop the color ramp right in here between the factor and the roughness. So we can now just play around with these colors. And that'll change the roughness. So I'm going to start to drag this black tab out. And you can see as I drag it out, it's becoming more contrasty. And so it's becoming more see-through. You're able to see through that better. But then there are still areas which are much harder to see through. And they're more rough. And already, that is starting to look like a really cool crystal material. All right, so now we can create the custom color. So if you have a specific color in mind, you can just take this base color. And you can change it to whatever color you want. I'm going to be showing you how to create a custom node with different colors so that you can change the colors if you want to. So to do that, let's press Shift-A. And I'm going to search for a RGB. And I'm going to click on this and drop it here. So this RGB is just color value. So it's basically the same thing as this base color. It's just color value. Now, I want to have five different color presets. So I'm going to bring this way up here. And then I'll press Shift-D, drop it down here. And I'll just continue to do that until there are five of them. So we have four and five of them. All right, so I now want to put these all together into one node. So I'm going to press B for the box select. And I'm just going to box select these ones. So make sure these are the only ones selected. I'm now going to press Control-G. And Control-G is going to create a node group. And if you press Tab, that is going to go in and out of the group. So it's sort of like you're going into edit mode of the node group. So I'm going to Tab to go back into the original setup. And then I do want to rename this so it looks a bit nicer. So I'm going to press N to open up the side panel. And I'm going to click right over here on the node. And then right here on label, you can just change the label. So I'm just going to rename it to color. And then that way it says color right there. Now, we don't actually have any of those values. So I'm going to Tab to go into the node group. And I now want to plug all of these colors up to the group output. So I'm going to take this color, plug it into the group output. And you can see when I did that, I added a new slot here. So I'm just going to continue to do that by plugging all of these up here. Just plug those all up. And the last one right here. So now if I press Tab to go back into the original setup, you can see that we have all these values here. And we can plug these values into the base color. Now we need to change the colors. And we can also rename these as well. So let's Tab into edit mode. And then I'm going to make all the different colors. So for this first one here, I'm going to make this just fully white so that it's very bright. And then for the second one here, I want to make this kind of a purplish color. So I'm going to make it kind of pink. And I actually don't want to make it too saturated because I find that if it's too saturated, it actually doesn't look quite as nice. It's a bit hard to see through the crystal if the color is too saturated. All right, so there's my purple color. I'm also going to make this one kind of a blue color, something like that. And then this one here, this is going to be a red color. So let's make that a bit brighter and a bit more saturated. And then the last one here is going to be a green color. I'll turn the brightness all the way up and then make it a green. And actually, I do want to turn the brightness up on all these so that it's very bright. So I'll turn the brightness all the way up and then just make them a little bit saturated. So you can just make whatever colors you want. So I'm going to have a white one, a purplish one, or kind of a pinkish, a blue one, a red one, and a green one. Now right here on the node group, we can change the names. So if you click right over here on this group right here, if you press end to open up the tab, you can click on group and we can change the names. So I'm just going to double click on the output right here to rename it. And I can just call this white. And then this one here is purple. And then this one here is blue. And then we also have red. And then the last one is green. All right. Now, if you tab back into the original setup, you can see we now have those different colors. And if you drag and drop these in, that is going to use those custom colors that we've created. So you can just take a look at all these. That looks pretty cool. And then if you want to adjust the colors, you can do that. So I don't really like this because this looks a bit too pink. And I want to make it look a bit more purple. So I'm going to select this and we will tab to go into the group. And then I can just change this color. And I'm going to make it much more blue so that it looks more purple. And that is looking much better. All right. So now what I want to do is I want to create a custom one as well so that you can just make a custom color. So I'm going to take the group input and I'm going to put that down there. So now what I want to do is I actually want to make a new output. So I'm going to click on the plus right here in the outputs to make a new output. And then I can just rename this one to custom. So now that we have that custom output, I'm going to take the group input and I'm going to put the input into that custom. So if I now tab to go back to the original setup, you can see we now have the custom. So we can just make this whatever color we want. And then we can take the custom right here and plug that into the base color. And there we have it. So we can now create a custom color. And for the custom color, I'm going to make this like a bright orangey color. I think that looks really cool. And you can see when it's super saturated, it makes it kind of a bit harder to see through the crystal. So I find that making it a little bit less saturated, a little bit more towards the white does look a bit better. And there we have it. So there is the basic crystal material. Now I still want to do the displacements. So let's do that. So I'm going to select this object right here. And then right up here, I want to duplicate this material, but keep all the same information. So I'm going to click on this button right here and that is going to duplicate the procedural crystal. So I duplicated it. And so it now says procedural crystal 001. So I can just rename this to procedural crystal. And then I'm going to type displacement. All right. So now let's create this second version with the displacement. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. And we're just going to drop the Voronoi down here. I'm now going to control shift and select it to preview what it's looking like. And then right over here, I want to take the object coordinates. So from the texture coordinate, I'm going to put the object into the vector. So it's using the object coordinates. And then on the scale here, I've found that a value of 3.5 looks pretty good, but you can change that to your liking. So I now want to take the distance and I want to put that into the displacement of the material output. And then let's control shift and select the principle. Now, just like these bump nodes right here, we need to add a displacement node to convert this data to displacement data. So let's press shift A and I'm going to search for the displacement node. And we can just drop this displacement node in between the Voronoi and the displacement. And I'm just going to drop this down here. Now, because this isn't actually a displacement map, we need to just convert it to displacement data. So I'm going to plug the distance instead up to the height. So we now have this scale value right here, and that is going to change the strength of the displacement. Now you can see that it's not really working. You can see that it's not actually bumping out of the mesh. So what we're going to do is we're going to go right over here on the side panel. We're going to go to the material properties, and then I'm going to go right down here and you're going to open up these settings. And then right here under the settings, you can see there is this displacement. So right now it is set to bump only, but I want to click on displacement and bump. And that way we're telling the material that it's going to actually use the displacement. And as I talked about at the beginning of this tutorial, the displacements in the node editor will not work in Blender Eevee. So this will not work if you're using Blender Eevee. So now you can see that it's actually displacing the mesh, but that is way too strong. So on the scale here, I'm just going to make the scale much smaller to like a 0.1. And now if you zoom in here, you can see that that crystal is bumping out and we have that really cool Voronoi texture. So it's making the object all lumpy and it looks like a crystal. And then I think the orange is really cool. And I also do really like the blue. I think that is cool. But I think my favorite one is the purple one. So I'm just going to plug this into the purple one. I'm going to click on this object right here. So the other one, and I'll plug the purple up. I just like the purple the best. So that is it. That is the finished procedural crystal material. And there is the final render. So that's going to be it for this tutorial. So thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0whu3494_c,Procedural Scratched Plastic (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural scratched plastic material in Blender. It guides viewers through setting up a value node to adjust scratch sizes and change the plastic color. The tutorial uses a geometry node's pointiness value to simulate worn edges, noting that this feature isn't supported in Blender Eevee, with an alternative using the ambient occlusion node recommended for Eevee users. The tutorial emphasizes using Cycles for rendering. It also highlights the availability of the procedural material for purchase on Gumroad and access to project files via Patreon. Additionally, the tutorial is sponsored by Blender Grid, a rendering service, offering a discount for new users.","In this tutorial I will show you how to create this procedural scratched plastic material in Blender. Now there are a few really cool things you can do with this scratched plastic, so in the tutorial I'll show you how to set this up so that you can change this value node right here, and it's actually going to change the size of the scratches. And then also you can change the color of the plastic, so I think red looks pretty nice, but you could also change it to blue, so I'll show you how to set this up as well, and of course you could create any plastic color that you wanted. And as you can see this plastic material also looks kind of worn out on the edges, so I'll be using the pointiness value on the geometry node to make the edges look like they're more worn out. Now one thing to note here, the pointiness value doesn't actually work in Eevee, so if you want to do this tutorial in Eevee you can, but you won't be able to use the pointiness value, so instead what you could do is use the ambient occlusion node, that works in Eevee, it doesn't look exactly the same though, but if you really want to do this tutorial in Eevee then you could switch this out for the ambient occlusion node, but I would recommend using cycles render for this tutorial. This procedural material is available for purchase on my Gumroad store, so if you'd like to check that out I'll have the link in the description, and also you get access to the project files if you join my Patreon. And if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials then you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs, or if you'd like to learn how to create more of my procedural materials then you can also check out my procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. And then also before we start I wanted to thank this video's sponsor, Blender Grid. Blender Grid is an easy to use render firm specifically designed for Blender. I've used the service and I highly recommend it. Upload your Blender file or a zip file with the Blend file and textures. You can change the render settings on the website before rendering. Blender Grid will let you know the cost before you start the render. You can even choose when you want the render to finish if you're on a tight deadline. While it renders you can check the rendered frames to make sure everything is rendering properly. Once it finishes just download the files and compile the frames in a video editor. Use the link in the description to get $20 of render credit on your first render. So let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D space if you want to set yours up like mine. So I added an icosphere, a subdivided icosphere, and I shaded it smooth. And then I also added a Suzanne monkey head and I gave it a subdivision surface modifier so it's nice and smooth. And then I shaded the object smooth as well. And then also to get some nice bright lighting right over here I added in this plane light. So this is just a plane with a subsurf modifier so that it is round. And then I gave it a bright emission material. And then to get some nice realistic lighting and reflections I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDR and this is from polyhaven.com. So I'll have a link in the description if you'd like to download that from polyhaven.com. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial. So to enable that add-on you can just click on edit and open up Blender's user preferences and then over there on the add-ons just search for the Node Wrangler add-on and you can just turn on the Node Wrangler add-on. Alright so let's get started. So I'm going to select this object, I'm going to click on new, and I can just rename this to scratched plastic. And then I can click right here and I can drag and drop this material onto this object as well so they have the same material. Alright so we're going to be creating four different types of scratches and then we'll combine them all together. So to start off I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to add a noise texture so just search for the noise texture and drop it down here. And then using the feature from the Node Wrangler you can hold down the ctrl and shift key and then select nodes and that is going to preview the node. So I'm going to turn the scale up to 15 so it's a bit smaller and then with the noise texture selected I'm going to press ctrl t that's using the other feature from the Node Wrangler and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I want to use the object coordinates so we're going to put the object into the mapping. Now this isn't really looking like scratches right now so on this scale here on the mapping I can change this x scale and that is going to stretch the noise texture and it's going to make it look more like scratches. So on the x scale right here I'm going to change this to 30 so now those look much more like scratches. Now as I said at the beginning of the tutorial I want to create a value and then I can just change that value and it'll change the size of all the scratches. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a value node let's drop it here and then I can take this value and I can put that into the scale that way we can just change this single value and it'll change the scale for all of the scratches. So on the value node right here I'm just going to set this to a value of eight. All right now those scratches are not very contrasty they're kind of just gray so I want to make this much more contrasty so to do that I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp and let's just drop the color ramp right in here. So I can now start to drag these out and that's going to make it more contrasty. Now I actually want to switch these values so I'm going to put the black over here and the white over here. So I'm just going to bring the black to about there and then I'll bring the white over and you can now see that we have all those little scratches in there. So that is it for our first layer of scratches. So I'm going to be creating four different layers of scratches and then we'll combine them all together. So to organize this better I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for a frame and let's drop the frame in here. So I'm going to deselect everything and then pressing b for the box select I'm going to click and drag and I'm just going to select these three nodes and then I can just drag and I can drop them into this frame. Now the texture coordinate and value nodes are going to be plugged into the other scratches so I'm not going to put them into this frame I'll just leave them out here. I'm also going to click on this frame and then I can press the n key and that is going to open up this side panel right here and if you go to node you can go to this label here and I can just rename this to scratches one and you can see now that I've renamed that this says scratches one right here so I can now press n to close that. Now scratches two is going to be very very similar to this so what I'm going to do is press b for the box select I'm just going to box select all of these nodes and then I'll press shift d to duplicate and we're going to drop it right up here. So I now want to take this value node and I'm going to put it into the scale because I want to change the scale for these nodes as well. I want this value node to control the scale for all the scratches and then also I'm going to control shift and select this color ramp to preview it and then also I want to take the object coordinates and I want to put that into the vector of this mapping here and then this scratches right here it says scratches one so let's press n to open up the side panel and I can just rename this label to scratches two and then I can press n to close that. Alright so now this is looking exactly the same if we control shift and select these nodes you can see they're exactly the same so these scratches scratches one they are going up and down but I want scratches two to be going side to side so right here on the mapping node I'm going to take the x scale and I'm going to turn that back to one which is the default and then I'm going to take the z value and I'm going to turn that to 30 instead so now if I control shift select this you can see that's going up and down and control shift select scratches two and that is going side to side so that's looking really good so we now have two layers of scratches so let's create a third and a fourth layer of scratches so to create the third layer of scratches I'm going to press shift a and let's search for a voronoi texture and I'm going to just drop it right up here let's also select this scratches this frame right here and I'll press shift d to duplicate it and I'm just going to drop it right up here and then I can click on the voronoi texture and drop it in there and then again I also want to take this value and I want to put that into the scale so that we can control all of the scale of the scratches with just this value and then I also want to take this object and put that into the vector so that we're using the object coordinates and then I'm going to control shift and select the voronoi to preview it now if I click right here on this frame right here I want to press n to open up the side panel and this one I want to rename to scratches three and then I can press n to close that now on this voronoi texture I'm going to click on the f1 and I want to instead change that to distance to edge and you can see we have that cool texture there and so we're going to use these lines right here to create the scratches now these are way too thick right now and they're not very contrasty so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp and we're going to drop the color ramp right in here and then click and drag and drop it into this frame right here so I can now take this white value and I can drag it really really close so I'm just going to drag it very close just like that and then I'm going to click on the black tab and I'm just going to drag it out just a little and then I will drag the white tab even closer so that is the result that we're getting now I don't want them to look like chunks that are kind of connected together I want them to just look like scratches so to create this I'm going to click on this noise texture and I'm going to press ctrl shift d that will duplicate the voronoi texture but keep everything plugged up to it and then on the distance to edge I'm just going to change this back to f1 and then I'm going to take this color ramp and I'll press shift d to duplicate this as well and bring this down so I want to take the distance and I want to plug that into the factor and then I can ctrl shift and select the color ramp so I'm going to drag this way back so that we can start to see this better and you can see that it's creating all these circles here so I want to make those circles way more contrasty so I'm going to drag this to about there and then I'll also drag the white tab out as well so those circles are much more contrasty so now I can use these circles here to get rid of parts of these scratches so that there won't be as many of them and they won't be connecting so to do that I'll press shift a and I'm going to search for a math node let's drop the math node right here and then click and drag and drop it inside the frame so I'm going to plug this color ramp into the top value and then I'm going to take this one and plug that into the bottom value and then it's really important to make sure you clamp the values and what clamping the value does is it restricts the colors to just zero and one so if you clamp that you can now see it there is dark right here there's black and then this is fully white whereas if you were to not clamp this you can see there's different shades of white so just clamp that and then it will clamp the values from zero to one and there we go so you can now see that we're just having some little scratches here and there and then if you want to play around with those scratches you can change this right here so you can pull this color ramp out if you want to make those scratches a bit bigger or a bit smaller and you can also play around with this if you want to be able to see more of those scratches or less of those scratches so that is the third layer of scratches so I want to create one more very similar to this so I'm going to deselect everything and then press b for the box select I'm going to select all of these nodes right here I'm now going to press ctrl shift d ctrl shift d will duplicate everything but it'll keep everything here plugged up so we'll just bring this over so I know this might be looking a bit complicated but really it's pretty much the same thing this value is just going into the scale value and that way we can play around with this scale and it's going to change the scale for all the textures and then this texture coordinate is just telling all the textures to use the object coordinates so we're using the object coordinates there from the texture coordinate all right so right up here we're going to click on this frame and we're going to open up the side panel and I'm going to rename this one to scratches four and then I can ctrl shift and select it to preview it now it's looking exactly the same right now and that is because we haven't really changed anything so scratches three and four look the same so I want to use a mapping node to change where it's mapped so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a mapping node and let's drop the mapping node right up here so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this object right here the object coordinates and I'm going to put that way up here on the vector of the mapping and then we can replace this so I'm going to take the vector and put that into the vector of the voronoi and also this one as well so put that vector into the vector the voronoi and then you can also click and drag and you can drop this mapping node inside this right here inside the scratches frame so now that we have that plugged up we can just change the mapping values and that's going to change where the scratches are so right here on the y rotation I'm just going to change this to 90 that way it's just going to rotate the scratches over by 90 degrees and now if you control shift and select this and this you can see that they are now located in different spots all right so we now have all of these scratches we have four layers of scratches so scratches one two three and four so we can now combine them all together into one group of scratches so to do that I'll press shift a and I'm going to search for a mix rgb and let's just drop the mix rgb right up here so I'm now going to take this add this top one here I'm going to put the value into color one and then on the scratches three this value is going to go into color two and then I can control shift and select this to preview it now I just want to add the dark values so on the mix here I'm going to change this to darken and then on the factor you can just turn that all the way up to one and so what this is doing is it's adding both of these textures together and so we now just have one group of scratches so I'm going to do the same thing down here so I'm going to take this mix rgb and I'll press shift d to duplicate it and let's just drop it down here so we're going to combine scratches two and one now so let's take the color we're going to put that into color one and then we're going to take these scratches one we're going to take the color ramp and put that into color two and then just make sure this is set to darken with the factor to one so again we're taking these two different scratches and we're combining them together and you can see now we have lots of scratches so now we have these two and we just want to combine these two together so to do that we'll do the exact same thing so I'm just going to select this and press shift d to duplicate it and let's take the color and we're going to put that into color one and then this one here we're going to put that into color two and then ctrl shift and select this and now you can see that all of those scratches have been combined and we now have this really detailed map with lots of random scratches so let's just select these nodes we're going to just kind of bring them up here and so I now want to put these scratches into the normal to give it some bumps so the scratches are going to look like they're going into the mesh so I'll take the color here and I'm going to put that into the normal and then I'll press shift a and I'm going to search for a bump node because we need to convert this to normal data so just add the bump node right in here so the color is going to go into the height and then the normal can go into the normal so I can now ctrl shift and select the principle and just see how that's looking and you can see we have all those nice scratches in there now I do think that looks a bit too strong so I'm going to turn the bump strength to a 0.1 just to a 0.1 so it's much less strong and you can't really see those too well now but once we make the object darker and more shiny you'll be able to see those scratches better and if you want to make the scratches deeper you can just turn the strength value up all right so now let's make the colors so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for the geometry node and let's just drop the geometry node right here and then I'm going to plug the pointiness value up to the base color now as I talked about at the beginning of the tutorial the pointiness value doesn't work in blender eevee so if you want to do this in eevee you could press shift a and you can search for the ambient occlusion node now if I ctrl shift and select this you can see the ambient occlusion node sort of looks similar so you could play around with the options here and you could also add a color ramp in here to kind of play around with the colors but I'm going to be using the geometry node because it works better all right now I want to be able to control those colors a lot better so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp and let's just drop the color ramp right in here so the color ramp is going to be in between the pointiness and the base color so I can now start to drag these out and we're going to make it more contrasty let's also ctrl shift and select the color ramp to preview it and you can see this is what the pointiness is doing so what it's doing is it's making the outer parts of the mesh lighter but then the crevices it's making that darker so I'm going to drag these pretty close so something like that and then I'm going to click on this one here and I want to make this a red plastic so I'm going to make this kind of a dark red kind of like that and if you'd like to use the same exact red color that I'm using that you can click over on the hex value and you can type in a hex value of 812725 so that is the exact red color that I'll be using and then this white tab here that is going to be the color of the plastic that's kind of been rubbed away and kind of worn so I'm going to change this to kind of a peachy tannish color and the hex value for this one is a hex value of 8c6a57 all right so I can now ctrl shift and select this to preview that and you can see now it's just looking like the edges are a little bit worn now I also want to make this more shiny because plastic is pretty shiny so I'm going to take the pointiness value and put that into the roughness and then we need to control that better so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp and I'm going to put the color ramp right in here between the pointiness and the roughness so we can now change these values and that's going to change the roughness so specifically what I want to do is I want to make the edges the worn edges look like they've been scuffed up a little bit and so they're going to be less shiny but then the rest of the plastic is going to be more shiny so I can just ctrl shift and select the color ramp to preview it and I want to bring this black tab to about here and then I'll bring the white tab over to about here so I can ctrl shift and select this and you can now see that right over here that is going to be less rough but then right down here that's going to be more shiny and you're not really able to see that very well so I'm going to take the black tab and I'm going to make that more gray and now you can see that's becoming more and more rough so I'm just going to turn this down so it's a bit more black something like that so you can see that is definitely more shiny but then kind of there along the edges that is more rough and you could make that stronger if you wanted to by pushing these values together so I'll just ctrl shift and select the principle to preview that all right so that's looking pretty good you can see it's shiny and we have a bunch of different scratches in there so that is looking pretty cool but there is just one more thing that I want to do to this material I do want to add just a tiny little bit of noise all over the plastic so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's just drop the noise texture down here and then I'm going to take this texture coordinate and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and drop it here you could also just take the object and plug that into the noise texture but it's easier just to add another noise texture over here and then you can plug the object into the vector and then I can ctrl shift and select it to preview it so I'm going to turn the scale on this noise texture to one so that those colors are much bigger and then I do want to have a little bit of detail but not too much so I'm going to turn the detail here to a value of eight all right so I can now plug this into the bump just to give it a little bit of bump so I'm going to take the bump node right here and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and let's drop it right down here so the normal can go through the normal so we can now take the factor of the noise texture and we can put that into the height and that way we can combine multiple maps together to make more bump so I can now ctrl shift and select this bump and you can see what it's doing and that is a bit strong so on the strength here I'm going to change this to a point zero four and that way it is much less strong so I can now ctrl shift and select the principled bsdf and kind of zoom in here and you can see now there's just a tiny little bit of noise and that just makes the plastic look a bit more rough and then just one other thing that I forgot to do if you'd like to create a blue plastic let me just show you how to do that so I'm going to take this color ramp and I'll press shift d to duplicate it we're going to drop it right up here and then again I want to take the pointiness and put that into the factor and then I can ctrl shift and select this color ramp to preview it so I can now just change these colors to whatever color I want the plastic to be so in this case I want to do a blue plastic so I'm just going to make this a blue color and the hex value that I'll be using for this plastic is two three four eight one and then also this right here I don't want this to be this peachy color so I'm going to make this a little bit more blue and a bit darker and the hex value that I'll be using for this one is six nine six c seven f so I can now take the color and put that into the base color just ctrl shift and click on that to preview how that's looking so I do think a blue plastic looks nice of course you could change this to whatever color of plastic that you want I'm just going to take this color and put it back into the base color because I prefer the red plastic all right and there we have it so there is the finished procedural scratched plastic material and here is the final render thank you so much for watching and I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and if you'd like to help support me and my youtube channel then you can purchase this procedural material on my gumroad store

Or if you'd like to learn how to create more of my procedural materials, then you can also check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube, I'll have the links in the description. And then one more thing before we get started, I wanted to thank this video's sponsor, Sketchfab. Sketchfab has a huge 3D model store where you can purchase models and assets. You can even upload your own 3D models on the platform. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can preview 3D models in your browser. You can also preview 3D models on a phone or tablet. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. So let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So I just added some subdivided icospheres and I shaded them smooth. And then I also wanted to preview what the material might look like on something like a kitchen countertop. So to do that, I added these cubes right here, and then I added some bevels on the side of the cube so it has a nice smooth surface. And then I shaded everything smooth. And then I also added a camera and I pointed the camera at these objects. And then also I added this plane light right here. So I just added a plane with a subsurf modifier so that it is round. And then I also gave it an emission material and I turned the strength up. If you're using Blender EV, you could also just press shift A and go right here to light and just add an area light. And then also to get some nice, realistic lighting and reflections, I added in this Machineshop 021K HDR. So this is a free HDRI from polyhaven.com. So I just added it in the world as an environment texture and just opened up that HDRI to get some nice, realistic lighting and reflections. And then I will also be using the NodeWrangler add-on in this tutorial. So to enable the NodeWrangler add-on, just click on edit and go to Blender's user preferences. And then right up there in the add-ons tab, you can just search for the NodeWrangler add-on and just enable that. And I'll show you how to use it in the tutorial. All right. So as I said, we're creating two procedural granite materials, and I will have timestamps in the video description if you'd just like to watch one of them. So we're going to start by creating the colored granite. So this one is going to be kind of like an orangey, reddish, peachy color. So let's click on new here. So I can just rename this material to granite colored. And then I'm also going to press Z, move my mouse up, go into the rendered view to preview that. And also I'm going to click and drag and I'm going to drop that material on this object right here. So it'll be the same material. So to start off, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's drop the noise texture down here. And then we did turn on the node wrangler add-on. So if you hold down the control and shift key, you can select different nodes while holding down the control and shift key. And that is going to preview different nodes. So I'm going to control shift and select the noise texture and we can preview how that's looking. Now I'm also going to select the noise texture and press control T and that is going to add the text record and mapping. And then I don't need the mapping node because that is just to change the location, rotation and scale, but I don't need to do that. So I'm going to select the mapping node and I'll press X to delete it. And then I want to use the object coordinates. So I'm going to plug the object in to the vector. So I'm going to turn the scale to a 16 so that it's a bit smaller. And then I'll turn the detail all the way to the max, which is 15. And then I do want to add a little bit more roughness. So I'm going to turn the roughness to like a 0.6 so that there's a bit more roughness. Now that isn't looking anything like granite. And so I want to change the colors. So to change the colors, let's press shift A and I'm going to go to the search here and I'm going to search for a color ramp and let's just drop the color ramp right in there. So I'm going to take this black tab and I'm going to drag it out and you can see that as I drag it out, it's going to make things more black and I'm going to keep this fully black. So I'll just make this a fully black color. Now inside these little black bits, I want there to be a little bit of brown. So I'm going to hold down the control key and then click right there. And that is going to add another tab and I can drag it over. And then for this color right here, I'm going to make it a bit lighter and I'm also going to make it a bit brown. And then when I do that, you can start to see there's a little bit of brown right in there. And for this brown color, if you'd like to use the exact same color that I'm using, then you can click right here on the color and click over on the hex value. And then you can type in a hex value of 583826. That's the exact brown color that I'll be using. Now I'm going to click on this white tab right here and I'm going to drag it out a little bit and then I'm going to make this kind of a yellowish tannish color, something like that. And then if you want the same exact color that I'm using over here on the hex value, you can type in F2A95C. Now I want to add a little bit more of a peachy color in this material. So I'm going to hold down the control key and click right here and that's going to add another tab. And then this one, I'm going to make it a little bit more peachy and we'll also make it a little bit brighter. And the hex value for this one is F29C6C. All right, so that's looking pretty cool. But usually this type of granite has a little bit more red and it has a little bit more noise. So what I'm going to do is select this noise texture and then I'm going to press control shift D. So normally shift D will duplicate nodes, but if you press control shift D, that will duplicate the node, but it'll keep this data plugged up to it. So the object will still be plugged into the vector. Now let's control shift and select this noise texture to preview it. And I'm going to set the scale to 60 so it's much smaller. And then I'm also going to turn the detail like down to five because I don't want it to be quite that detailed. Now this isn't very contrasty and I want to make this much more contrasty. So to do that, I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp and let's just drop this color ramp right here. So I'm going to drag this black tab out to make that a bit more contrasty and I can also drag this out to make that a bit more contrasty. So I'll bring this white tab to about here and then the black tab to about there. So now we have these two different textures and I want to combine them together. So to do that, I can press shift day and I can search for a mix RGB. We're going to drop the mix RGB right here. And then I want to take this top color ramp and I'm going to put that into the factor. And then I'll take this bottom color ramp and I'm going to put that into color one. Now you can see that it's making everything lighter. And so I want to click right here and I want to change this to darken because I want things to be darker. So now on color two, we can change this. So I'm going to make this a red color. And as I start to make it a kind of a darkish reddish color, you can see we're starting to see all of that detail come in. And for this red color, the hex value that I'm using is a hex value of six F two, two, two, nine. So now you can see there's much more detail in there and that is looking quite nice. Now after looking at reference images, it seems like usually this type of granite also has some little white specs. So what I'm going to do is take this noise texture, I'll press shift D to duplicate it. We're going to duplicate it one more time and then I'll plug the object into the vector and then I can hold down the control and shift key and select it to preview it. Now for this one, I'm going to change the scale to 25 so that it's a bit bigger and then I will turn the detail all the way to 15 so it's very detailed. And then also I do want to give this a little bit more roughness. So for this top one, I'm going to give it a roughness value of a 0.65 so it has just a little bit more roughness. Now again, we want to make this more contrasty because I want it to be very clear where those white specs are. So I'm going to take this color ramp and I'm going to just select it and press shift D to duplicate it. And we're just going to drop it right in here. So the noise texture will go into the factor. So I can now drag these together and we can make this much more contrasty. So that's pretty good. So you can now see it. Those white spots are just here and there, but most of it is black. So I now want to combine this one with the final material. So I'm going to click on it, this mix RGB and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and let's drop it right here. So I'm going to take the color and I'm going to put the color into the factor and let's also control shift and click on this to preview it. And then I want to take this darken right here and I want to put that into color one. Now I don't want this to be set to darken because I want it to be bright. So I'm going to click on this darken and instead I'm going to change it to lighten. So I can now change this color to, to fully white. So let's just make it all the way to white. Let's click over on the RGB for red, green, and blue, and we can just drag these all up to one. So it's fully bright. And then I find that it works a little bit better if it's just slightly darker. You can see as it gets darker, it starts to get more invisible. So I'm going to make it a tiny bit darker. And that way you'll just be able to see a tiny bit through those white areas. All right. So that is it for the color. So I can take the color and I can put the color into the base color on the principled and then just hold down the control and shift key and select the principled BSDF. So that's looking pretty good, but I do want to make this very shiny because this is a nice smooth granite material. So it does need to be nice and shiny. So on the roughness here, I'm just going to change this to a 0.2. So it's much more shiny. And there we go. So there was the first procedural granite. Now there is just one more thing you could do. This granite material is a little bit saturated. And so I do find that it can look nice if it's a little bit less saturated. So if you'd like to make this just a little bit less saturated, you can press shift day and you can search for the hue saturation node. I'm just going to drop the hue saturation value node right in here between the lighten and the principled. So now if you turn the saturation down, it's going to make it less saturated. And so it will be more black and white. So this is personal preference. You can do it if you want to. I find that it looks a little bit more realistic if I just turn the saturation to a 0.95. That way it's just slightly less saturated. It is subtle, but I do think it looks kind of nice. So you could do that if you wanted to. So make sure you save your project and there is the first granite material. All right. So now we are going to be creating the second granite material. So this one is going to be a white granite. So I'm going to select these objects right here. I'll click on new and I can just call this granite white. So I'm going to call this one granite white. And then also I can click right here and I can drag this over and drop it on this object as well so that it has the granite white material. So for this material, again, I'm going to press shift day and we're going to search for a noise texture. Let's drop the noise texture here and then I can control shift and select the noise texture to preview it. And then I also want to press control T with the noise texture selected. That's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping, but we don't really need the mapping. So I'm going to press X to delete it and let's just plug the object up to the vector so that it's using the object coordinates. Now for the scale here, I want to set this to like a 35 so that it's much smaller. And then let's also turn the detail all the way to the max, which is 15. And then I do want it to be a bit more rough. So I'm going to turn the roughness value to a 0.7. So it's just a little bit more rough. Now we need to make this more contrasty because it's not very contrasty. So again, let's press shift day and I'm going to search for a color ramp node and let's just drop the color ramp node right in here. So the factor can go through the factor and then you can just control shift and select the color ramp. So now I can just start to drag these values out and that'll make it more contrasty. So I'm going to bring them out to about there and you can see now that is much more contrasty and that is looking much nicer. Now we could just take this color and plug it into the base color and control shift and click on this, but that doesn't look too much like granite. It's a bit simple and I do want to add a bit more detail and I also want to add some more swirly bits in the granite. So let's add some more detail to this. So I'm going to press shift day and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture and let's drop the Voronoi right here. And then again, I want to plug the object up to the vector so that we're using the object coordinates and then I can control shift and select the Voronoi to preview it. And then I'm going to click on this F1 and I'm going to instead change it to distance to edge. So we now have this really cool texture. Now I want to make this much more sharp, so I'm going to press shift day and I'm going to search for a color ramp node and we're just going to drop the color ramp node right in here. So I can now start to drag this white tab out and that is going to make it much more contrasty because we are crushing those values and so it's going to be much more white. So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this Voronoi texture to distort another noise texture. So I'm going to select this noise texture and I'm going to press shift day to duplicate it and drop it right down here and then let's control shift and click on it to preview it. Now for the scale here, I'm going to change this to like a 21 and then I don't want there to be too much roughness. So I'm going to turn the roughness back to the default, which is 0.5. So I can now use this texture here to distort the noise texture. So to do that, I'm going to take the color right here and I'm going to put the color into the distortion and so that is going to distort it and you can now see it. There's all these swirly bits and then also I do want to plug the object into the vector of the noise texture. So it's using the object coordinates and there we go. So you can see now it has a bunch of swirls. Now I do just want to make it a little bit more strong. So I'm going to press shift day and I'm going to search for a math node and let's drop the math node right here. So the color is going to go into the first value and then that value will go into the distortion. Now on this add here, I'm going to click on this and right up here under functions, I'm going to change it instead to a multiply and then we can start to turn up this value and you can see that as I turn up this value, it's going to make it much more strong. Now I don't want it to be too strong. So on the value here, I'm just going to change this to a 1.5 and now you can see that is definitely more strong, but it's not too strong. So we now have all these little nice swirly bits there in the texture. Now this isn't very black and white, it's kind of just gray. So I'm going to take this color ramp here and I'll press shift D to duplicate it. We're going to drop it right here and then let me just kind of move these out of the way, move that over, move that over as well. So I'm just going to control shift and select the color ramp to preview it. Now that's a bit too contrasty. So I'm going to drag this out a bit and then I will also drag the white tab over a bit and that way you can see that it's much more white. And so we're now just able to see some of those swirly bits. So if you control shift and select this, you can see we have that nice texture and then you can control shift and select this. So I want to join these both together. So I'm going to press shift day and I'm going to search for a mix RGB so we can mix the red, green and blue together. So we're going to mix these both together. So I want to take this first one, this top one up here, and I'm going to put that into the factor and then I'm going to take this color ramp and I'm going to put that right here into color one and then just control shift and select the mix to preview it. Now, because these are black values, I want to click on the mix here and I want to change this to darken. That way it's going to add the dark values. So now right here on color two, I can just make this fully black and now you can see that it's taking the dark values of both of these and it's mixing them together. So we now have a really nice texture there. It has a lot of detail and some noise, but then it also has some swirly bits here and there. So I'm going to take the color and I'm going to put that into the base color and then I can control shift and select the principle to preview it. Now again, this isn't very shiny and because this is a smooth granite, I do want this to be nice and shiny. So on the roughness, let's just change this to a .2 so it's more shiny. And there we have it. So there are the procedural granite materials and I just gave this a render and here is the final result. So that's going to be it for this tutorial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaPf5GDBfTs,Procedural Extreme Rusty Metal (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural extreme rusty metal texture in Blender. The creator highlights that this is their 50th procedural material and announces the release of their 5th Blender procedural material pack, available for purchase on various platforms. The tutorial guides viewers through setting up a 3D scene, using an icosphere, plane, and HDRI lighting, and employing the Node Wrangler add-on for node previews. The process involves using Musgrave and Noise textures, ColorRamp nodes, and bump mapping to achieve the rusty effect. Viewers are also encouraged to support the creator by purchasing material packs or learning more through their YouTube playlist.","In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural extreme rusty metal in Blender. Now, if you're a regular viewer of my channel, then you know that I create a lot of procedural material tutorials. And so this material here is my 50th material. And every time I create 10 procedural materials, then I create a Blender procedural material pack. So because this is my 50th procedural material, I've just released my Blender procedural material pack number 5. So if you'd like to purchase the material packs, I'll have the links in the description where you can purchase on my Gumroad store. And you can also get it if you join my Patreon. And I'm also selling the material packs on some other 3D model sites, so I'll have all the links in the description. And purchasing the material packs is a really great way to help support me and this YouTube channel. And if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. Again, I'll have all the links in the description. So let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So what I did is I added an icosphere and I subdivided it and then shaded it smooth, so we have a nice smooth sphere to preview the material. And then I also added this plane right here and I gave it a subsurf so that it's circular. And then I also gave it an emission material so that we have a nice bright light shining on our object. And then to get some very nice reflections to reflect off of the metal, I added in this HDRI right here. And this is from polyhaven.com, so it's a free HDRI and I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download it. So I just downloaded the 1K HDR version and then in Blender's world, I just added this in as an environment texture to get some very nice lighting. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial to preview different nodes. So if you don't have that enabled, you can click on edit and then open up Blender's user preferences. And then over there on the add-ons tab, you can just search for the Node Wrangler and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. So let's get started with this material. So I'm just going to select this object, I'll click on new, and I can just call this Extreme Rusty Metal. So to start off, I'm going to press Shift-A and I'm going to search for a Musgrave texture and let's drop the Musgrave texture right here. And then I want to Ctrl-Shift and select it to preview it. And then also, I want to select the Musgrave texture and I'm going to press Ctrl-T. Again, that's using the Node Wrangler feature and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now, I don't actually need the mapping, so I'm going to select the mapping and then I'll press X to delete it. And I can now plug the object into the vector, so I'm going to use the object coordinates. And that way, it'll place the Musgrave texture more evenly on the object. Now right here, I'm going to change the Musgrave type to the multi-fractal. And then I want to turn the scale down a bit, so I'm going to turn the scale to a 1.3. And then I'll turn the detail all the way to the max, which is 15, so it has much more detail. Now, to give it even more detail, I'm going to turn the dimension all the way down to 0. And now you can see that it has a lot more detail and that is looking a lot like rust. Now, I want to be able to control the colors so that it looks more like rust, because right now it's just black and white. So to control the colors, I'm going to press Shift-A and let's search for a ColorRamp node. And I'll just drop the ColorRamp right in here. And then we'll plug the height from the Musgrave texture into the factor. So I can now change the colors and that's going to change the color of the rust. So I'm going to click on this white tab and I'm going to bring it out. And then I'm going to make this color a gray color so it looks more like metal. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, then you can go over to the hex value and you can type in a hex value of 7F, 7C, 7A. So that is the exact color that I'll be using for the metal. Now let's also click on the black tab and we're going to make this color a dark brownish. And it's going to be slightly towards the red. And to use the exact same color that I'm using over here on the hex value, you can type in 663504. So now you can see that is looking much more like rust. Now I do want to add one more color of rust. So I'm going to hold down the Ctrl key and then click right here. And that is going to add a new tab. And then this one, I want it to be kind of a similar color, but it's going to be more towards the red. And for this color, the hex value is 8F3824. So I now want to put this color into the base color of the principled. So I'm going to take the color, we're going to put that into the base color, and then I can Ctrl Shift and select the principled to preview it. Now it isn't really looking that much like metal and that is because there isn't any metallic values. So let's take the metallic and I'm going to turn that all the way up to 1 so that it looks much more like metal. Now it's metal all over the place and I don't want the rust to be metallic. I want it to be more metallic where it's metal, but then where it's rust, I want that to be less metallic and more rough. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the height value and I can plug the height value into the metallic. That way, if I Ctrl Shift and select the Musgrave texture, you can see that it's going to use this texture to tell it where it's going to be metallic and where it's not going to be metallic. So I can Ctrl Shift and select the principled and you can now see that that metal is very shiny, it looks like metal, but then right over here, the rust doesn't look metallic. So I now want to give this material another layer of rust. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift A and we're going to search for a noise texture. Let's drop the noise texture right up here above the Musgrave texture and then I can plug the object into the vector on the noise texture. And then let's also Ctrl Shift and select the noise texture to preview it. Now on the scale here, I want to set this to 7 so it has a bit more scale and then I will turn the detail all the way up to the max, which is 15. And then also on the roughness, I just want to give this a little bit more roughness. So I'm going to turn the roughness to a 0.65 so it just has a little bit more roughness. Now I want to make this much more contrasty so that it's more clear where that second layer of rust is. So to do that, I'll press Shift A and I can just search for a color ramp and we're going to drop the color ramp right in here so the noise texture factor can go into the factor of the color ramp. And then just Ctrl Shift and select the color ramp to preview it. So to make it more contrasty, I can now drag these values out and when I drag these two values together, it's going to be more contrasty. Now I actually want to flip these values. So I'm going to bring this over here because I want the white to be over here and then I'll drag the black tab closer as well. So I now want to mix this with the final base color. So to do that, I'll press Shift A and let's search for a mix RGB and I want to put the mix RGB right in here between this color ramp and the base color going into the principled. And then I want to take this color ramp and I'm going to plug this into the factor on the mix. And then I can Ctrl Shift and select the mix to preview it. So because we plugged this color ramp into the mix, the values on this color ramp is going to tell it where that extra rust is going to be. So you can see that we have all these white areas right here and that is where the extra layer of rust is going to be. So if I change color 2, that is going to change the color of that second layer of rust. So I want to change color 2 to a bright orange color. And to use the same exact color that I'm using on color 2 over here on the hex value, you can type in 954800. So you can now see that we have that extra layer of rust all over the material. So let's Ctrl Shift and select the principled to preview it. Now we don't really have any control over the roughness right now, so what I want to do is make it more rough where the rust is, but then more shiny where the metal is. So to do that, I'm going to take this mix and I'll press Shift D to duplicate it and I'll drop it down here. And then I can plug this color into the roughness of the principled. I'm now going to take this color ramp and I'm going to take the color and I'm going to put that into color 2. And then I want to take this top color ramp and I'm going to put this color into the factor. And then I don't want it to be set to mix. I'm going to change the mix to add. So it's right here, add. And then I will Ctrl Shift and select the add to preview it. And then on color 1, I'm going to go to the hex value and I'm going to type in a hex value of B5B5B5. So it's now going to use this data to tell it where it's going to be shiny and where it's going to be rough. So let's Ctrl Shift and click on the principled and you can see that is looking much better. So the material is really starting to look cool now, but it doesn't have any bump because there is nothing going into the normal. So I want to add some bump into the normal, especially where the rust is because I want the rust to look like it's bumping in. So to do that, let's press Shift A and I'm going to search for a bump node and let's click on the bump and just drop it down here. So I can first take this color from the main color ramp and I'm going to put that into the normal. Now we need to convert this to normal data because this green one here, that is color data, but the purple here, that is a normal data. So we can use the bump node to convert that to normal data. So I'm going to take the bump and I'm going to put it right in here. So the color is going to go into the height of the bump and then the normal can go into the normal. So now you can see that is looking very bumpy. Now it's a bit too strong right now. So I'll turn the strength value down to like a 0.1. So it's much less strong, but it's still bumpy. If you zoom way in there, you can see there's just a little bit of bump. Now I also want the second layer of roughness to be bumpy as well and I want that to be more bumpy. So I'm going to take this bump and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and we can drop it right here. So the normal can go through the normal. So we now have this extra height value that we can plug data into. So I'm going to take this color ramp, I'm going to take the color and I'm going to put that into the height. And then I want it to be a bit more strong. So I'm going to turn the strength to like a 0.2 so it is more strong. And now you can see that it's much more bumpy, especially where that second layer of rust is. Now, right now the rust is popping out and I want to make the rust look like it's going back in. So on the second bump, I'm going to click on the invert button and now you can see that where that rust is, it looks like it's going back in a little. All right, so we are almost done with the material, but I do just want to add one more layer of bump just to make the metal look like it's a little bit bumpy all over the place. So I'm going to take this bump and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and I'll drop it down here. So the normal can just go through the normal. And then what I can do is I can take the factor here from this noise texture and I can put the factor all the way down here onto the height. And then I don't want it to be too strong. So on this second bump here, I'm going to turn the strength down to like a 0.07 and that way it'll just give a little bit more bump to the material. And then you can just control shift and select the principled BSDF to preview the final material. So I'll just give this a render and we can take a look at the final thing. And there we have it. So there is the procedural extreme rusty metal. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and thank you so much for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKRK82JeBo8,Procedural Stone Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video is a Blender tutorial that demonstrates how to create a procedural stone material using various textures and nodes, such as Voronoi and noise textures, along with the NodeWrangler add-on. The tutorial also highlights the creator's available resources, including tutorial files and courses on Gumroad and Patreon, offering additional learning materials and support options for viewers. The tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on setting up the material, adjusting its properties, and enhancing its appearance with realistic lighting and bump mapping to achieve a stone-like texture. Additionally, the creator encourages viewers to explore their other procedural materials and tutorials available on YouTube and Gumroad.","In this Blender tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural stone material. Now if you'd like to purchase the tutorial files, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store, and also my Patrons will have access to the project files as well. So if you'd like to check out my Gumroad and Patreon, that's a great way to help support this channel. And if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials, you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs, and you can also check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube if you'd like to learn how to create more procedural tutorials. And then one more thing before we start, this video was brought to you by my Blender tutorial courses on Gumroad. So I currently have two tutorial courses on my Gumroad store, and I have plans for more tutorials in the future. So the first one that I have is this tutorial right here, where I show you how to create this Martian environment in Blender. And then the second one is this one here, where I show you how to create this sci-fi space station corridor in Blender. So if you'd like to check out the tutorial courses, I will have the links in the video description, and purchasing the courses is a really great way to help support me and this YouTube channel. Now to have something nice to preview this object on, I just added a monkey head and I gave it a subsurf modifier and then shaded it smooth, and then I also added a subdivided icosphere and shaded it smooth as well. And then I also added this plane light right here with an emission material, and that way we get some nice bright lighting on our objects. And then also to get some very realistic lighting, I added in the Forest Slope 1K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com, so it's a free HDRI, and I'll have the link in the video description if you'd like to download it. So I just added it in here as an environment texture to get some nice natural lighting on these objects. And then I will also be using the NodeWrangler add-on in this tutorial, so if you don't have that turned on, you can go to edit, and then open up Blender's user preferences. And then over on the add-ons tab, you can search for the NodeWrangler add-on and just checkmark the NodeWrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So I'm going to click on new, and I can just call this material Procedural Stone. And then I can click right here, and I can drag and drop this material onto both of these objects. So to start off, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. Let's drop the Voronoi right here. And then using the NodeWrangler add-on, if you select this texture, you can press Ctrl-T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Although we don't need the mapping node, so I'm just going to select it, and I'll press X to delete it. And then using another feature from the NodeWrangler, I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key, and then click on different nodes to preview them. So I'm now going to take the object coordinates from the texture coordinate, and I'm going to put that into the vector of the Voronoi, and that's going to place the Voronoi texture around the objects more evenly. Now that isn't really looking like a stone texture, and so I want to distort the Voronoi texture. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a noise texture, and we're going to drop the noise texture in between the texture coordinate and the Voronoi. And that way, the data from the noise texture is going to warp the Voronoi texture. And then I'm also going to turn the detail all the way up to 15, so that it's very detailed. You can see that's looking much nicer. And then I'll also turn the roughness up to a 0.55, so there's just a little bit more roughness. All right, so let's plug the distance into the base color, and then I will Ctrl-Shift and select the principled BSDF. Now that doesn't really look too much like stone, and so I want to change the colors of the stone. So I'll press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Let's click on the color ramp, and I can just drop it right in here. So we can now just change these colors, and that'll change the colors for the stone. So I'm first going to click on the white tab, and I'm going to make this white tab a dark gray. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over to the hex value, and on the hex, you can type in 3 six times. So 333, 333. So that is the exact color that I'll be using. And then I'll click on the black tab, and I'm going to make this a light brown. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, over on the hex, you can type in 8c, 8c, 8c. So you're going to type in 8c three times. That is the exact color that I'll be using. And you can see now that is looking much more like stone. Now I want to create some little cracks in the stone, so I'm going to click on the noise texture, and then shift click on the voronoi texture. I'm now going to press ctrl shift d. So shift d will duplicate the nodes. If you just press shift d, that will duplicate a node. But if you press ctrl shift d, that is going to duplicate it, but it'll still keep that wire plugged up. So I'll just do that one more time. So you can shift select both of these, and then press ctrl shift d. And then I'm also going to ctrl shift and select the voronoi texture to preview it. Now to make it look like cracks, I'm going to click on the F1, and I'm going to change this to distance to edge. And now you can see that we have all these little cracks in here. And then on the noise texture, I'm going to change the scale to 3, so that those cracks are a little bit bigger. And then the scale here on the voronoi, I'm going to change that to 2. So now we have some much bigger cracks. Now I want to mix these cracks in with the color. So I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a mix rgb. And let's drop the mix rgb right here after the color ramp. So I'll take this voronoi texture down here, and I'm going to plug that into color 2. And then I'm also going to ctrl shift and select the mix to preview it. And then this color ramp up here, the top one, that is going to go into color 1. Now I don't want to evenly mix this together. I want to click on the mix, and I'm going to change it to darken. And now if I start to turn up the factor, you can see it's just adding those cracks. Now I don't want the cracks to be very strong. I don't want to be able to see them too well. So on the factor here, I'm just going to change this to a 0.3. And that way you can definitely see the cracks, but they're pretty subtle. So then I can ctrl shift and select the principled bsdf to preview that so far. Now I want to be able to control the roughness, because right now it's a little bit shiny. So I'm going to take this color here, and I'm going to plug the color into the roughness. Now it's way too shiny, so I need to make this more rough. So to do that, I'll press shift a, and I'm going to search for another color ramp. And we're going to drop the color ramp right here before it goes into the roughness. So we can now change these colors, and that is going to control the roughness. So I'm going to click on the black tab, and I'll click on the color. And if I start to turn this up, as it starts to get lighter, it's going to be more and more rough. So I'll just bring that up pretty light, because this is stone, and so I do want it to be pretty rough. So something like that. Now stone is usually pretty bumpy, and so I want to put some data into the normal. So I'm first going to take the color, and I'll just stick that into the normal. And then we need to convert this to normal data. You can see there's some weird shading issues. So I'll press shift a, and I'm going to search for a bump node. Let's click on the bump node. And I want to put the bump node in between the color and the normal. That way it'll convert this color data to normal data. Now I actually want to put the color into the height, and that way it'll convert this color data into normal data. So now the normal can go into the normal, and you can see now it's very bumpy. Now it is pretty strong right now. So on the strength value, I'm going to turn the strength to a 0.25, just a 0.25. And so that way it's much less strong, but it is still bumpy. Now I also want the crack texture to contribute to the bump. If I control shift and select this, you can see here is our crack texture. So I'm going to click on this bump, and I'll press shift d to duplicate it and drop it right here. So the normal can just go through the normal, because that is already going to be normal data. So we can now take this voronoi texture, and we can plug the distance into the height. That is going to, again, convert it to normal data. So if I control shift and select this, you can see now that is normal data. And then I can control shift and select this, and you can see that now it's adding both of these bump maps together. So I can now control shift and click on that final material. And then I do want those cracks to be a little bit stronger. So I'm going to turn the strength up to a 0.35, so that they're a little bit stronger. Now you can't really tell where they are, and that is because if I control shift and select this, you can see that it's not actually very contrasty. So I want to make this map more contrasty. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A, and let's search again for another color ramp. And I can just drop the color ramp right in here between the voronoi and the bump. So I'm just going to drop it right here. So I can now control shift and select this color ramp. Now I can click on this white tab, and I can start to pull it closer to the black tab. And you can see when I do that, it's making it more contrasty, because we're pushing these values closer together. So I'm going to bring the white tab pretty close, and that way now those cracks are much smaller. So if I control shift and click on the principle, you can see now the bumps on those cracks are much smaller, because we're using this data instead of this data. So this data is going into the bump, and now it's giving all those bumps and cracks there. So if I control shift and select the final material, you can see that is looking much better. Now I want to give one more layer of bump, because I want to have some big jaggedy pieces to make it look more like stone. So I'm going to click on the noise texture, and then shift, click on the voronoi. And then again, I'm going to press control shift D. That will duplicate it, but keep the object plugged up to the vector. And then I can control shift and select the voronoi, so that we can preview it and see what we're doing. Now for this one, I'm going to take the color, and I'm going to instead plug that into the randomness. And then I'm also going to turn the scale right here to an 8. So the noise texture is distorting the randomness, and so if you zoom in here, you can see there's all this detail right there in those cracks. And then I'm also going to turn the noise texture scale to a 6.3. And that way you can see there's some more noise there. All right, so we can now plug this into the bump as well. So I'm going to go right over here, and I'm going to take this bump, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and we're going to drop it right here. So the normal can go through the normal, so we now have this height value that we can add data into. So let's take the distance on the voronoi. We're going to plug the distance into the height, and then I can control shift and select the principled BSDF to preview the final thing. And then it is just slightly strong. So on the strength value here on this last bump, I'm going to change the strength down to a 0.2, so it's just slightly less strong. But you can see what it's doing. If I control shift and select it, you can see it's adding in those little bumpy areas right there. And that is it. So that is the finished procedural stone material. So I'll just give this a final render. And there we have it. So there is the procedural stone material. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and I hope it was helpful, and thank you so much for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zv3vbiJ_dc,Procedural Damaged Plaster (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor guides viewers on creating a procedural damaged plaster material, covering steps like setting up lighting and using textures such as Voronoi and Musgrave to achieve a worn look. The video promotes the instructor's Gumroad store and Patreon for purchasing tutorial files, and highlights Blender Grid as a recommended render service. Throughout the tutorial, techniques such as using the Node Wrangler add-on, creating color ramps, and adjusting bump maps are demonstrated to add realistic imperfections and details to the material. Viewers are also encouraged to explore additional procedural material resources and tutorials available through the instructor's platforms.","In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to create this procedural damaged plaster material in Blender. Now if you'd like to help support me and this channel and purchase the tutorial files then you can do that over on my Gumroad store, links in the description, and also my patrons over on my Patreon page will have access to the project files. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials, and you can also check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist if you'd like to check out more procedural tutorials. And then I also wanted to give a huge thanks to this video's sponsor, Blender Grid. Blender Grid is an easy-to-use render firm specifically designed for Blender. I've used the service and I highly recommend it. Upload your Blender file or a zip file with the Blend file and textures. You can change the render settings on the website before rendering. Blender Grid will let you know the cost before you start the render. You can even choose when you want the render to finish if you're on a tight deadline. While it renders, you can check the rendered frames to make sure everything is rendering properly. Once it finishes, just download the files and compile the frames in a video editor. Use the link in the description to get $20 of render credit on your first render. All right, so real quick, let me just show you what I have set up in the 3D space. So I just added a monkey head and I added a subsurf modifier and shaded it smooth, and then I also added an icosphere and gave it a lot of subdivisions and shaded it smooth. Now for the lighting, I added this plane light right here, so this is just a plane with a subsurf modifier, and then I gave it an emission material so that we have a nice, bright light shining on our objects. And then also to get very realistic lighting, I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com, so the link's in the description if you'd like to use the same HDRI lighting that I'm using. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial, so if you don't have that enabled, just go to edit and then open up Blender's user preferences, and then if you go to the add-ons tab, you can just search for Node Wrangler and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. All right, so I'm just going to select this object, I'm just going to click on new, and I can just call this damaged plaster. And then I can also click right here and I can drag and drop this material onto this object. So to start off, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to go to the search here, and I'm going to search for a voronoi texture. Let's just drop the voronoi texture right here, and then using the feature from the Node Wrangler add-on, if you have this selected, you can press ctrl T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now we don't actually need the mapping, so I can just select the mapping node and press X to delete it. And then if I ctrl shift and select different nodes, that is going to preview the node, and again that's using the Node Wrangler add-on. So I'm going to hold down the ctrl and shift key and then select this node to preview it, and I want to use the object coordinate. So if I plug the object into the vector, you can now see that that texture is being placed around the objects more evenly, because it's using the object coordinates. Now I want to make these dots a lot smaller, so I'm going to set the scale here to 40 on the voronoi texture. What we're doing here is we're just creating some little dots, and we're just going to use that to give it a little bit more imperfection and make it look a bit more worn and old. So I now want to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a musgrave texture. So this musgrave texture is going to be used as the main texture. So let's just put it under the voronoi, and then again if I ctrl shift and select the musgrave texture, I want to plug the object into the vector. And then I'm going to turn the scale up to 7, and then I also want to turn the detail all the way up to 15, so that it's much more detailed. You can see right in there it has a lot more detail. And then also I want to turn the dimension down to zero. What this is going to do, it's going to add all this little tiny detail and make it look very rough. Now this is just black and white right now, and so I want to be able to change the colors and make it look more like plaster. So to do that I'll press shift A, and I can search for a color ramp node. So let's just click on this color ramp, and we can just drop this color ramp in here between the viewer and the musgrave texture. So the height from the musgrave is going to go into the factor. So we can now just change these colors, and we can also move them around, and that's going to change the colors for the musgrave texture. So let's first drag this black tab out a little bit, and then I'm going to click on the color slot right down here to change the colors. So for this one I'm going to make it a bit brighter, and I'm going to make it kind of a light brown, kind of a tannish, orangish, brownish color. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, then on this color right here you can go over to the hex value, and you can type in a hex value of a 76736. So that is the exact color that I'll be using. So now I'm going to click on this white tab here, and I want to make this color kind of a yellowish color. So I'm going to make it a bit darker, and then I'll make it a little bit more towards the yellow. And again if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, then over here on the hex value you can type in cc9453. So that's the color that I'll be using. So I'm also going to hold down the ctrl key, and then I'm going to click right here, and that is going to add a new tab. And I'll just bring this tab over to about here, and then this one I just want it to be a gray color. So I'm going to click right here, and I'm going to go to the RGB for red, green, and blue, and I'm going to drag them all to one. So drag all these values to one. I can now just click right up here, and I can drag this down, and that's going to make it more gray. And then I'm also going to drag it over just a little so that it's a little bit more brown. And again if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, then over here on the hex value you can type in a hex value of 9c8981. So we have this color map here, and it is looking pretty cool, but I want to add the dot texture in with it. So I want to mix them together. So to do that I'll press shift a, and I can search for a mix RGB. Let's just drop the mix RGB right here. And so this color ramp is going to be going into color two, and then I want the voronoi texture to be going into the factor. And then I don't want it to be set to mix. I'm going to click right here, and I'm going to instead change it to add. Now if I ctrl shift and click back on this, you can see that these dots aren't very contrasty, and I want to make them much more contrasty. So to do that I'll press shift a, and again I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. So let's just drop the color ramp node right in here between the distance of the voronoi and the add. So let's drop it right here, and then I'm going to ctrl shift and click on it to preview it. So I can take this white tab, and I can drag it way over, and you can see that it's going to make it much more contrasty. So I'll bring it over to about here, and then on this black one I can drag this one out a little bit as well. Now I don't want it to be fully black, because that would be a bit too strong. So on the color here I'm going to just click on this black color, and I'm going to drag it up a bit so that it's a much more light brown. So now you can see we have white with some light brown dots. So I can now ctrl shift and click on this, and you can see that it isn't really looking that good. It's very white, and you can barely see the texture. So to fix this I'm going to take color one, and I'm going to make it be a much more gray color. And for this color if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, then over on the hex you can type in 494949. And we can now take the color, and we can put that into the base color on the principled. So I can now ctrl shift and select the principled to preview that. All right now I also want this map here to affect the roughness. So we're going to take the color, and we're going to put that into the roughness as well. Now it's way too shiny right now, and damaged plaster wouldn't look that shiny. So I'm just going to box select these nodes, and press g to grab. We're just going to bring them over a little bit. That way I have room to add a color ramp right in here. So I'll press shift a, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Let's just click on the color ramp, and we're going to drop it right in here. So it's going from the color through the roughness. So now we can change the colors of the color ramp, and that's going to change the roughness. So if I click on the black tab, I can click on the color right here. And as I start to turn this up, and as I start to make it more white, you can see that it's much more rough. If I drag this way up here, very white, you can see now it looks very chalky and dry. But then if I drag it down, it's more shiny. So I don't want to bring it up too high, but I will bring it up to something like this. So you can see now it's a bit more rough, and it will also look more rough when we add more stuff into the normal to give it some bump. And speaking of bump, I do want to add a bunch of noise all over the object. So let's do that. So I'm first going to take the color, and I'm going to put the color into the normal. But you can see that something isn't right here. There's some weird shading issues. There's some weird glitches right there. That is because we need to convert this to normal data, because this is color data, but this is normal data. So to convert it, we're going to press Shift-A, and we are going to search for a bump node. And let's drop the bump node right in here. So the color is going into the height. We actually want the color to be going into the height on the bump, and then the normal can go into the normal. So now if you zoom in here, you can see we've converted that to normal data, and so now it looks nice and bumpy. So that is looking better, but I also want to add some noise over the entire thing. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's go to the search, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. So let's click on the noise texture, and I'm going to drop it under the Musgrave. And then let's also Control-Shift and select it to preview it. And again, I want to plug the object up to the vector, so it's placed on the objects more evenly. So on this noise texture, let's change the scale to a 7, so it's a bit smaller. And then I also want to make it more detailed. So let's turn the detail level all the way up to 15, so it's very detailed. Now I want this to be affecting the bump as well, so we're going to take this bump node, and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it, and we're going to drop it down here. Now because this has already been converted to normal data, the normal can go through the normal. So we now have this height value that we can add data into. So let's take the factor of the noise texture, and we're going to plug that into the height. And then I can Control-Shift and select the principal BSDF to preview the final thing. Now that is very strong, and I want to make it less strong. So on the strength here, on the second bump, I'm going to turn the strength down to like a 0.2, and that way it's still there. You can definitely see it, but it's much more subtle. Now I can also use this noise texture to create the damaged parts. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and let's just drop the color ramp right down here. And then I can Control-Shift and select it to preview it. So now what I can do is I can take the factor, and I can put the factor into this color ramp. And now what we can do is we can play around with these values to make it more contrasty. So I'm going to bring them together so they're actually really close. And so you can see now that I've dragged these together really close, you can see that we basically created a mask, and we can use this mask to tell the material where it's going to look damaged. So where there's going to be little holes and broken pieces in the plaster. So let's first add this color ramp data into the final base color. So let's press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for another MixRGB, because I want to mix this data in with this data. So we want to add this to the color data. So I'm going to take the mix, and I'm going to put it right here after this add, right before it goes into the base color. So I can now Control-Shift and click on this to preview it. So I can now take this color right here from this color ramp, and I can put the color into the factor. And then I actually want to take this wire from the add, and I want to put that into color two. That way it's going to flip it, so now you can see color one is going to be where those holes are. So I'm now going to take color one, and I'm going to make that a bit darker, and I'm also going to make it kind of a brownish color. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using over on the hex, I'm going to be using a value of 716057. So you can see now where the plaster is damaged, it looks kind of a grayish brownish. So let's Control-Shift and click on this to preview the final thing so far. Now if you zoom in here, you can see that actually doesn't look very realistic, and that is because those damaged parts aren't going in. So I want this mask right here to be going into the bump, so it looks like it's going back in. So to do that, I'm going to click on this bump node, and I'll press Shift-D, that will duplicate it, and I'm going to drop it right here. So again, this has already been converted to normal data, so it can be transferred through to the normal. So we now have this height right here that we can add data into. So let's take this color on the color ramp, and we're going to plug that into the height, and then just Control-Shift and select the principle to preview the final material. Now it's not really doing much, and that is because it isn't actually very strong. So I'm going to turn the strength up, and you can see when I turn the strength up, now it looks like it's going in quite a bit. And specifically, I think a strength value of 0.35 looks pretty good. Alright, so this material is starting to look very cool, but there is one more thing that I want to do. I want to add some little cracks around the material. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for another noise texture. So let's just drop this noise texture right down here. I'm also going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for another Voronoi texture, and we can just drop the Voronoi right down here. And then let's Control-Shift and select it to preview it. And then again, I want to take the object, and I want to put that into the vector of the Voronoi, and we'll use this noise texture in a moment. Now to make this look more like cracks, I'm going to click on the F1, and I'm going to change it to distance to edge. And when we do that, now you can see we have all these little black lines that look like cracks. Now it doesn't look very organic right now, because the cracks are so sharp. So that is where the noise texture comes in. So I'm actually going to use the noise texture data to distort the Voronoi texture. So if we take this noise texture, and we put it right here, we can actually put it in front of the Voronoi. So the noise texture is going to affect the vector, and so it's going to distort the Voronoi texture. And then I'm going to turn the scale on the noise texture to a 1.5, and then I'll also turn the detail all the way up to 15, which is the max. So it's very detailed. So now we're getting a map that looks really cool, and it looks like we have all these little cracks, and it's very detailed. Now I want to make it more contrasty, because I don't want those cracks to be that big. That's way too big. So I'll press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Let's click on the color ramp, and we can drop it right in here after the Voronoi. So if we start to drag these values together, it's going to make it more contrasty. So I can just click on the white tab, and I can drag the white tab very close. And you can see when I do that, it's now making those cracks very thin. So I'm going to drag the white tab very, very close, just so that those cracks are very thin. So we now have a really cool map here. So now I just need to plug this into the final material. So I want the cracks to look like they're bumping in, so I'm going to plug this into the normal. So again, I'm going to select this bump node, and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it. Let's just drop it right here. So now we can take this color, and we can put it into the height. So now if I Control-Shift and click on the final material, let's just zoom in here, you can start to see those little cracks. Now they are a little bit subtle right now, so I'm going to turn the strength value up, and when I turn the strength value up, now you can see those cracks are much stronger. But I don't want them to be too strong, so I'm just going to turn the strength to like a 0.4, and that way you can still see them, but they're not too strong. And then also, if you want to change the size of them, you can play around with this value. So you can see as I start to bring this away, those cracks are looking bigger. You can also drag the black tab out, but I prefer to bring the black tab all the way over here, and then just bring these pretty close, and that way the cracks stay pretty small. And that is it. So that is the final material. So I'll just give this a final render. So there we have it. There is the final material. There is the procedural damaged plaster. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and thank you so much for watching.

Alright, so let me just show you what I have in the 3D space. So I just pressed Shift-A and I added a cube because I thought it would look cool to add it on a cube. I tabbed into edit mode, and then I pressed Ctrl-B to manually add a bevel. And then I scrolled my mouse wheel to subdivide the bevel, and then I just clicked to place that. Now I'm also going to be using the displacements in the node editor, so I do want this to be pretty detailed. So I'm going to press Ctrl-R to add a loop cut, and then I'm going to type in 80 for 80, and then I'll press Enter. And then I will also right-click so it hops back to the center. And then I'll also do the same thing over here. So over here I'm going to press Ctrl-R, I'll type in 80, and then left-click, and then right-click so it hops back into the center. And then one more time, back and forth. So I'm going to press Ctrl-R, and then type in 80, and then Enter, and then right-click. So that way we have a very subdivided and detailed cube. I'm going to rotate this cube over, kind of bring it over there. Let's go into the camera view, just going to kind of scale this down, and bring it over so that we can see three sides. And then also using the object context menu, I'm going to shade it smooth. Then I'm also going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go right down here and add an icosphere, because I also like to add procedural materials to spheres. And then right behind me, if you click on the Add Icosphere setting, I'm going to turn these subdivisions to 7, so that way it's pretty smooth and subdivided. And then I'll also shade it smooth. Then I can also bring this over and kind of scale it a little bit, and I think I'll scale this up a little bit. Now for lighting the scene, over here on the world I added in this Forest Slope 1K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com, so it's a free HDRI. I'll have the link in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. So I just added the HDRI in as an environment texture. And then I also added this light right here, so this is just a plane that has a subdivision surface on it. And then I also gave it an emission material with a strength of 50, and that way you can see we have some nice bright lighting shining down on those objects. Now to get the displacement to work, you can go right up here to the render properties, and then make sure you're using cycles, because the displacements in the node editor will not work in Eevee, so make sure you're using cycles. Now you could use the adaptive subdivision if you want to, but I'm not going to do that in this video, so I can just leave the feature set set to supported. Now to make the displacements work, we need to go down here to the material properties, and we need to add a new material. So I'm just going to click on new, and I can just call this Mud Brick Wall. And then I'm also going to click right here and drag, and I'm going to drop the material on both of these objects. And then the last thing that we need to do, right down here under the settings, under the surface, if you want to use the displacement, then on the displacement right here on this material, you need to change it from bump to displacement and bump. And that way it'll actually work with the displacements. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this video, so if you don't have that turned on, you can click on edit, and then open up the preferences, and then if you search for the Node Wrangler under the add-ons tab, you can just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on. Alright, so I'm going to start off by pressing shift A, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. I'm going to drop the Voronoi right down here. And then using the feature from the Node Wrangler, I can control shift and then select different nodes. Now to make this look like brick, I'm going to click on the F1, and I'm going to change this to distance to edge. Now this doesn't look very much like mud bricks, so to make it look more like mud bricks, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a noise texture, and let's drop the noise texture right here. And then using the other feature from the Node Wrangler, I can select a node, and I'm going to press control T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I don't need the mapping, so I'm going to click on the mapping, and I'll press X to delete it. So I now want to take the object, and I want to put the object into the vector on the noise texture. So now I can take the color, and I'm going to put the color into the randomness of the Voronoi texture. That is going to distort the randomness, and now you can see that looks much more like random bricks. So to make it look even better, I'm going to turn the detail all the way to the max, which is 15 on the noise texture, and that's going to add more detail. And then also I'll turn the scale to like a 13, and now you can see that is looking very nice. Let's also change the scale of the Voronoi. So I'm going to change the scale of the Voronoi to like a 19, so that there are much more bricks. And then I'm also going to turn the noise texture roughness up to a 0.62, and you can see that just adds a little bit more roughness there, and a little bit more detail. You can see if I start to turn it down, it just looks a bit more boring, but then as you turn that roughness up, it just looks a little bit better. So that is looking good, but I don't want it all to be bricks, because I want there to be some patchy areas where it looks like there's more mud or dirt on the wall. So to do that, I'm going to take this noise texture, and I'm going to press Shift to duplicate it, and I'll drop the noise texture right down here. And then I can plug the object up to the vector on the noise texture, and then I can Ctrl Shift and select it to preview it. So I'm going to turn the roughness to a 0.58, so a little bit lower. And then I'll also turn the scale of this one down to like a 5. So I now want to mix these together, so I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to search for a MixRGB, and we can mix both of these together. So I'm going to drop this right here, and then I'll take the factor of the noise texture, and I'll put that into color 2. And then I'm going to take the distance from the Voronoi, and I'm going to put that into color 1. And then I can Ctrl Shift and click on this to preview it. Now I don't want this to be set to Mix, so I'm going to click on this, and I want to go right down here, and I want to change this to Add, because I want to add them both together. And then I want to turn the factor all the way up to 1. Now that isn't looking very good, it's just making everything look more white, so I need to make this noise texture more contrasty. So I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and let's put the color ramp right here between the factor and color 2. So now I can just change the colors and make it more contrasty. So I can start to drag this out, and you can now see that it's much more contrasty. And then I'm also going to bring this out as well, and make it a little bit stronger. So now you can see that it looks like there's some little bits of mud and dirt on that brick wall. Alright, so that's very good, and this is the base for our displacement. So let's now plug this into the displacement. So I'm going to take this color, and I'm going to plug it into the displacement on the material output, but then we need to actually add a displacement node to convert it to displacement data. So I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to search for the displacement node. We're going to drop the displacement node right here between the color and the displacement, and then I can just kind of bring it down here under the principal. Now I actually don't want this to be going into the normal, I want it to be going into the height, because this is color data, so it needs to go into the height, it can't go into the normal. Now it's looking way too strong right now, so let's go ahead and fix that. So on the mid-level, I want to change that to 0, because we don't want any mid-level. And then on the scale here, I'm going to change the scale to a 0.025. So it is very subtle, but if you zoom in here, you can see that where those little bits of mud are, they're popping out. And then right here, you can see that the bricks are going back in where it's darker. So let's Ctrl Shift and click on the principled BSDF. And then I do want this to look pretty rough, I don't want it to look like it's wet or shiny. So on the roughness here, I'm going to turn the roughness up to like a 0.7, so it's more rough. Now it's just white right now, so we need to give it some color. So I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and let's just drop the color ramp right here. So I now want to take the noise texture, and I want to take this factor, and I want to put it into the factor of the color ramp. So we can use this noise texture to create some random colors for the shader. So I'm going to take this color, and I'll put it into the base color. So I'm first going to click on the black tab here, and I want to make it a very dark brown. So I'm going to click on the black here, and I'm going to make it a bit brighter, and then make it a strong brown color. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value, and you can type in a hex value of 191109. So that is the color that I'll be using. Now let's also click on this one, and this one I want to be a much lighter brown. So let's click on the color, we're going to make it a little bit darker, and we're going to make it kind of an orangey color. And again, if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using, over here on the hex value, you can type in B4 7D 5 0. And then I want to add one more color in here. So I'm going to hold down the control key, and I'm going to click right here underneath that G. So I'm going to make one more darker color right here. So I'm going to click on this color, and I'm going to make it a bit darker and a bit more brown. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using over here on the hex value, again you can type in a hex value of 925B39. So then if you control shift and click on this, you can see we have some very nice colors, and that's looking quite nice on our material. Now I do want to add some more information to this color. So I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a mix RGB. And let's drop the mix RGB right here. So I'm going to put the color ramp into color one, and then if I control shift and click on this add here, I want to take this data, this information, and I want to plug it into color two. And then I can control shift and click on this. And then I don't want it to be set to mix, I want to click on this, and I want to change it to darken. So now you can see those cracks in between the bricks are darker. And then I'm also going to turn the factor up to like a 0.6, so it's a little bit darker. You could keep turning it up, but I don't want it to be fully black, so I'm going to turn it to a 0.6, so it's just a bit darker. And then I want to add one more value into this color. So I'm going to take this darken, and I'll press shift to duplicate it. We're going to drop it right in here between the color and the base color. We'll just drop it right there. And then if I control shift and click on this, I want to take this data, and I want to plug that in as well. So this is the brick texture. So I'm going to take the distance, and I'm going to plug that into the factor of this second mix RGB. So I can now control shift and click on this to preview it. And then I still want it to be set to darken, but I want to take color 2, and I want to make that fully black. And you can see as I start to turn it down, now you're able to see it's darker right there, but then it's a bit lighter right there. So let's control shift and click on that to see what it's looking like. And you can see that looks a lot better, and it has a lot more detail. So we almost done with this material, but I do want to add two levels of detail in the normal. So I'm first going to take this ad right here. I'm going to take this ad, the color, and I'm going to put that into the normal. Now I need to press shift day, and I'm going to search for a bump node because we need to convert this to normal data because this is color data, but then this is normal data. So we need to convert it to normal data. So I'm going to use the bump node and just put the bump node right in here in between it. You can see there's some shading issues there. Everything looks black, but I'm going to take this wire and I'm going to put it into the height instead of the normal. And now it's converted to normal data and it looks very bumpy. Now I don't want it to be bumpy all over the place. I just want it to be bumpy here and there. So I'm going to press shift day and I'm going to search for another color ramp and let's drop the color ramp right in here between this connection. So right before it goes into the height on the bump. So if I control shift and click on this, you can see what it looks like. So if I start to drag this white tab out, you can see it's going to make everything much more white and blown out. And then I'm also going to drag this black tab out a bit more just to make those cracks a bit stronger. So I'm going to bring the black tab to about here and then I'll bring the white tab even closer. So we now have that map right there. And if I control shift and click on the bump, you can see that's what it's doing. So it's making those parts in between the bricks stronger. So if I control shift and click on that, you can see now we have that nice bump right in there digging into the material. All right. So I now just want to give one more layer of noise all over the material. And so I'm going to use this noise texture right here. So I'm going to take this bump node and I'll press shift to duplicate it. Let's drop it here. And then I can plug the normal into the normal. So we can now plug more information into this height value right here. So I'm going to take the factor from this noise texture and I'm going to plug that into the height. Now, when we do that, it looks way too strong. That is very strong. So let's make it less strong by turning the strength value right here to like a point four. So now that is much less strong. It's still pretty rough, but it's not too crazy. So I'll just give this a render and we can take a look at the final thing. And there we have it. So there is the finished procedural mud brick wall.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Q-p3LE8uw,Procedural Metal Crosswalk Plate (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural metal crosswalk plate material in Blender using procedural nodes. The video explains the process of setting up a 3D scene with a plane and an icosphere, adjusting displacement settings, and creating a repeating pattern of large and small dots to simulate the texture of a crosswalk plate. The tutorial also covers adding color and bump details to enhance realism, concluding with a render of the finished material. The creator mentions their Blender procedural material packs available for purchase, as well as resources for learning more about procedural materials.","In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to create this procedural metal crosswalk plate in Blender. So I was jogging through my neighborhood one day and I noticed that there were these metal crosswalk plating on the sidewalk. And so I examined it closer and I took some pictures and I thought it would be a really cool procedural material to create. So that's what I'm going to show you in this video. Real quick before we start, this video was brought to you by my Blender procedural material packs. So every time I create 10 more procedural materials then I create a procedural material pack. So each pack contains 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. If you'd like to purchase the material packs I'll have a link in the description where you can check them out on my Gimroad store and that's a great way to help support me and this YouTube channel. Or if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials you can check out my procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. Again I'll have the links in the description. And you can also purchase each single material by itself on my Gimroad store like this material here. All right so let me just show you what I have in the 3D space. So I just pressed shift a and I added a plane and then I'm going to be using the displacements to make the bumps pop out. So I'm going to tab into edit mode and using the object context menu I'm going to subdivide this and I'm just going to continue to do that and I'm going to subdivide it until it's pretty detailed, something like that. Then I'll tab back into object mode and I'm going to rotate this plane over on the x-axis by 90 degrees so it's pointed up and then I'll just move it over here so it's on the side of the camera. And then also I think it looks cool to preview a procedural material on a sphere. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to add an icosphere and then again I want it to be pretty subdivided so we can use the displacements. So on the subdivision I'm going to turn this to a six so it's very smooth and also I will shade that smooth with the object context menu and I can just move it over just like that. And then I will also be using the adaptive displacements so you can use that as well if you'd like to. So right over here on the render properties just make sure this is set to cycles because the displacement in the node editor won't work in Eevee so just make sure this is set to cycles. And then if you want to use the adaptive subdivision you need to change the feature set over to experimental. And then let's click on the object here. I'm going to click on new and I can just call this crosswalk plate. And then also you can click and drag and drop this material onto any other object that you want to add it to. Now there's just a couple more things we need to do. If you click right over here on the material properties you can scroll down and right under here under the settings there is displacement settings under surface. So I'm going to change this to displacement and bump and that way the material can use the displacements. And then just one more thing I want to turn on the adaptive subdivision so I'm going to go to the modifier properties. I'm going to click on add modifier and I'm going to add the subdivision surface on this object. So there we go there is the subdivision surface. Now I'm going to turn on the adaptive subdivision and then also on the dicing scale I'm going to turn this to like a 5 because I don't need to be too high detail because this is already a pretty subdivided icosphere. And then let's click on this object as well the plane. I'm going to click on add modifier and I'm going to go right down here and add a subdivision surface. And then again I'll turn on the adaptive subdivision and I'll turn the dicing scale to like a 2. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add-on in this tutorial to preview different nodes. So if you don't have that enabled you can just go to edit and then open up blender's user preferences and then under the add-ons tab if you search for the node wrangler you can just check mark the node wrangler add-on and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off we need to create some procedural dots and then we need those dots to be tiling and repeating again and again. So to do that I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a texture coordinate. So let's just take the texture coordinate and I'm going to drop it down here and we can also go up into a rendered mode just to preview our material. So I'm now going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a vector math node. So let's take the vector math and drop it right here and then I want to take the object and I want to plug that into the vector. Now let's control shift and click on the add node and to make this value repeat itself I'm going to click on the add and I'm going to change this to a fraction. So now that we've changed that to fraction you can see that it's repeating itself. Now you can see that the value is starting right here in the center and then it's going out on the y-axis and the x-axis. So I want to bring this to the center so that we can create a dot in the middle. So to move it to the center I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a mapping node and let's drop the mapping node right here. Now to move it to the center I'm going to take the x value and I'm going to change that to a negative 0.5 and you can see now it's moved over but we also need to move it up. So on the y value I'm going to do the same thing so I'm going to set it to a negative 0.5 and now you can see that that is in the middle just like that. All right so that is good but right now this is just going to create one dot in the center of each of these tiles and so I want to be able to scale this. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for another vector math node. Let's drop this vector into math node right here so it's going to be right after the texture coordinate and then I'm going to change this from add and I'm going to change it to scale. So right down here under distance and length it's scale. So now if we change this value it's going to scale that up and you can see it's going to be repeating itself over and over. So I'm going to change this scale value to 3 and that way there's going to be a big dot wherever the tile is. So now we need to actually make this look like a dot. So to do that I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a separate x y z because we want to separate the x y and z values. So I'm going to click on this and I'm just going to drop it right here after the mapping. If you hold down the control and shift key and then click on different nodes that is going to preview the node. That's using the feature from the node wrangler. So if I control shift and click on the separate x y z you can see the x one is going up and down. Let's control shift and click on that again and the y one is going back and forth. So I now want to just combine the x and the y together. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a combine x y z and let's drop this right here and then I want the x to go to the x and the y to go to the y and then we need one more node to make this look like a dot. I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search again for a vector math node. Let's drop the vector math node right here after the combine x y z and I'm going to change this one from add to a length because we just want to use the length of the value. So I'm going to go right down here and under distance here it is length and then let's control shift and click on the node to preview it and now you can see that we have procedural dots and if we go right back over here to the scale we can just scale those dots up and it's going to be an infinite amount of dots. All right so there we go so this is our node setup for the dots. So if you want to be able to organize this better you can press shift a and you could search for a frame. Let's just click on the frame and drop it here and then if you box select all these nodes you can click and drag and drop them into the frame and then they're all going to be together in the frame and then also if you want to label the frame you can select the frame and press n and that is going to open up the side panel and you could change this label to large dots just like that and then I'll press n to close the side panel and so now this group of nodes is the large dots. So I want to do that again but just have these small dots instead. So I'm going to deselect everything and I'll just box select the entire thing and I'll press shift d to duplicate this and bring it up here. Now if you click on this frame you can press n to open up the side panel and I can rename this to small dots and then I can press n to close that panel and let's also ctrl shift and click on the length to preview it. So I want to make these small instead of large so we just need to change the scale value. So I'm going to change the scale right here to a value of 20. So now you can see that we have the small dots and then ctrl shift and click on this and we have the large dots. So now we want to combine the two dots together so I'm going to press shift a and to combine them I'm going to search for a mix rgb. Let's drop it here so we want this value to go into color 2 and then we want this value to go into color 1. So I can now ctrl shift and click on that to preview it. Now right now we're just using the mix and so it's just evenly blending them together so I want to use a mask to tell it where it's going to be the large dots and where it's going to be the small dots. So to do that I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. Let's just drop the color ramp node right down here and I'm just going to bring this up and also bring the mix over a little bit and that way I can put the color ramp right in here and I will also bring these back just a little. So what I want to do is I want to take the big dots so I want to take the length and I want to put that into the factor of the color ramp and I'll just bring this up right here. So I can now use this color ramp as a mask to tell it where it's going to be the large and the small dots. So I'm going to take the color and I'm going to stick that into the factor here on the mix. Now it didn't really do anything and that's because we need to make this more contrasty. So if I ctrl shift and click on the color ramp you can see how it is right now it's kind of gray so if I start to drag these together you can see that now the dots are much more contrasty. Now I actually want to switch these values so I'm going to put the white value right over here and the black value over here and then I'm going to bring these both over a little bit to make the dots bigger. So I want this white one to be right about here under the arrow and then I want the black one to be pretty close but you can see there's just a tiny little bit of blending but it is pretty close. So now if I ctrl shift and click on this you can see that is much better. So now we have the large dots on top of the small dots. So now let's add this into the displacement. So I'm going to take the principle and I'm going to bring it way up here and then I can ctrl shift and click on it to preview it and let's also bring the material output right up here and then also I'll press ctrl s to save this. So I now just want to use this mix as the displacement so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a displacement node and let's just drop the displacement right here. So I can now take the color and I want to put that into the displacement on the material output but we need to convert this to displacement data so I'll take the displacement and we're going to drop that right in between the mix and the displacement and then I need the mix here I need this color to be going to the height and then that will work properly. Now if you let that load up you can see it's way too strong so on the mid-level here I'm going to turn that to a zero so we aren't using any mid-level and then I'll turn the strength way down to a point zero three. Let's just wait for that to load up and now if you zoom in here you can see that is looking much better. So this is starting to look like what we want but you can see that the dots aren't popping out they're actually going back in so I want to change the shape of those dots. So to do that I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for the rgb curves and I'll drop the rgb curves right here and I'm going to drop it in between the length and the color too so I'll just drop it right there. So we can actually use the rgb curves to create the shape of the dots and I accidentally hit the g so just click back over here on the c we don't want to use the green values we want to use the c. So I'm going to start by clicking right here on this bottom dot right here right in the corner and I want to bring it all the way up to the top then I'm going to take this dot right here and I'm going to drag it all the way to the bottom. So now you can see if you kind of look on the side here wait for that to load up you can see now the dot is popping out but I want the bump to be curved and smooth on the edge so I'm going to click right here to add another dot and then I'm going to bring this dot right down here and I'll just bring it right over here so you can see there's this curve right here and there's this curve right here and I just want to put this curve right here so almost to the end of this grid. Then I'm going to click to add another dot and I'm going to bring this dot right up here so you can see there's this grid and then there's this grid right underneath it so I want to bring this dot right up here close to the corner close to the edge but a little bit back and then I'm going to click to add another dot and I want to make this a bit sharper because you can see it's kind of round so I'm going to bring this way down and bring this pretty close to this one so that this is nice and sharp so you can see basically what we're doing is we are creating the shape of that bump and then let's also select the bottom dot right here and I'm just going to bring it up slightly just so that you can see a tiny little bit of that line going down before it goes over to this dot right there all right so that is the first one and you can now see that shape is looking much better but I want to do the same thing for the small dots so let's zoom out I'm going to take the RGB curves and I'll press shift to duplicate it and I'll drop it right here behind the small dots you can see the length is going into the color one just drop the RGB curves in between that now this is already looking pretty good but I want those big dots to not be coming out quite as far so I'm going to zoom in and I'm going to take this dot right here and I'm going to drag it far down and I'll drag it right down here so it's a little under half so you can see there's this grid here this grid here and then this dot right here is going to be a little underneath this third grid right here and then I don't want this to be going way up because if you zoom in you can see those small dots now are kind of going back in and I don't want that so I'm going to click on this and I'm going to drag this down because I want this dot to be at the very top and then this one is going to go down so it's going to be a nice smooth curve going down and then let's also select this dot right here and I'm going to drag it down so it's going all the way to the bottom we can also click on this one and bring it down and a bit closer so it's a bit more smooth and then I'm also going to click to add another dot right here and we're going to bring this dot right down here and just smash it at the very bottom so now we just have that shape right there and that is looking very nice so there we go that is it for the displacement so you can see we now have those small dots and the large dots so let's press ctrl s again to save so we are almost done with the material you can see this circle right here is looking really weird that's because I just need to select the circle and I'm going to press r to rotate and I'm going to rotate it over on the x-axis and then I'll type in nine zero and enter just rotate that over so that I can see it from the front all right so this is looking really good and it's almost done but I just want to add a little bit of bump here on the normal and then I also want to change the base color so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a noise texture let's just drop the noise texture right down here and then if you make sure the noise texture is selected you can press ctrl t and that is using the node wrangler feature and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping now we don't need the mapping so I'm going to select it and then I'll press x to delete it and then I want to plug the object into the vector so right here on the noise texture I'm going to turn the detail all the way up to the max which is 15 and then I can put this noise texture into the base color to give it just a little bit of noise so I'll take the factor and I'm going to plug that into the base color now it's still looking white right now and so I want to add a color ramp in here to change the colors so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp and let's click on the color ramp and we're just going to drop it down here so we can now change the colors of the color ramp and that is going to change the final colors so I'm going to click on this white tab right here I'm going to click on the color and I'm going to make this one kind of a construction yellow color and if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using you can click over on the hex value and you can type in a hex value of c1841f so that is the color that I'll be using and then I'm also going to click and drag and drag this over so it's kind of over that r letter because I want most of this to be yellow now this one here I want this to look like a little bit of dirt here and there so I'm going to click on the black one right here I'm going to click on the color and I'm going to make this one a dark brown color and again if you'd like to use the same exact hex value that I'm using over here on the hex value you can type in 33261d so that is the exact color that I'll be using and then I also want to show a little bit more of it so I'll drag it over so it's kind of under the minus so if you control shift and click on the color ramp to preview it let's just wait for that to load up you can see that most of it is yellow but then there's just a little bit of dirt here and there because people would be walking on the crosswalk plate and so it would probably get a little bit dirty all right so let's control shift and click on the final material now there is just one more thing I want to do and that is I want to give it just a tiny little bit of bump so I'm going to take the factor right here on the noise texture and I'm going to put that into the normal on the principal and we need to convert this to normal data so I'll press shift a and I'm going to search for a bump node and we can use the bump node to convert this black and white data to normal data so I'm going to drop it right in here and then I want the factor to be going into the height on the bump and then the normal can go into the normal now that is way too strong right now so I want to make that much less strong so right down here on the strength I'm going to turn the strength value to a 0.05 that way it's going to be much less strong but if you zoom in there you can just see there's a tiny little bit of noise and it just gives it a bit more detail and that is it so that is the final material so I'll just give this a render and we can take a look at the final thing all right and there it is so there is the finished render so that's going to be it for this tutorial thank you for watching and I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and again if you'd like to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjlt3V7W08A,Procedural Cheese Material 🧀 (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural cheese material in Blender, detailing the steps to set up the blend file, including adding and modifying shapes like a cube and a cylinder to resemble cheese. The tutorial covers using nodes such as Voronoi Texture, ColorRamp, and Displacement to achieve the cheese's texture and holes, as well as adjusting lighting with an HDRI from polyhaven.com. The creator also promotes purchasing the material and procedural material packs from their Gumroad store and Patreon, as well as exploring their Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube for further learning.","In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural cheese material in Blender. Now if you'd like to help support me and this YouTube channel, then you can purchase this procedural material on my Gumroad store, and also you can get it if you join my Patreon. And another great way to help support the channel is by checking out my Blender procedural material packs. So I'm building up a library of procedural materials, so every time I create another procedural tutorial, I add it to my procedural material packs. And you can purchase my procedural material packs on my Gumroad store, and that is a really great way to help support me and this YouTube channel. So if you like using procedural nodes in your artwork, then definitely check out these procedural material packs. Or if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. I'll have the link in the description and a card right up there on the screen. Alright, so now I'm going to show you how I set up the blend file before we do the procedural material. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go right here and add a cube. I'm going to tab into edit mode, and then I'll press S to scale, and I'm going to scale it out on the y-axis, and then I'm going to press 3 or click right up here to the face select, and I'm just going to select this face. I'll now press S to scale, and we're going to scale it on the x-axis, and I'm going to make it really small, just like that. And now it looks like a slice of cheese. So I'm going to tab back into object mode and just kind of move this over. So I'm now going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to go down here, and I'm going to search for a cylinder under mesh. I'm going to tab into edit mode, and I'll press S to scale, and I'm going to scale it on the z-axis, and we'll just kind of scale that down because I want to make a round piece of cheese. So I'm now going to press 1 on the top of my keyboard, or also click right up here to the vertex select. I'm going to hold down the Alt key and select this ring of vertices. I can now press Ctrl-B, and Ctrl-B is going to add a bevel, and then I can scroll my mouse wheel out to add more subdivisions, and then I can click to place that. So I'll do the same thing down here. So I'll hold down the Alt key and select that ring of vertices. I'll press Ctrl-B to add a bevel, and then also I can select everything, and I'll scale everything up on the z-axis just so that it's a little bit thicker. And then I'll scale this whole thing up, and then using the object context menu, we can shade this smooth, and also this object as well. Using the object context menu, I'm going to shade this smooth. So I'm now just going to rotate these objects and just kind of move them into place, and then I'll press Shift-A, and I'm also going to add a camera, and I'll just move the camera to a nice spot, something like this, and then I can also kind of move these objects so it fits nicely in the camera's perspective. Now for the lighting, I'm going to be using this Abandoned Hall 01 1K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com. So the link will be in the description if you'd like to download this free HDRI, and you can just add it into your world as an environment texture, and that way we'll get some nice realistic lighting. Now because the cheese is going to have little holes, I want to use the displacement in the node editor. So to use the displacement, I'm going to go right up here to the Render Properties. Now if you want to use the displacement, you need to be using Cycles. Eevee will not support the displacement in the node editor, so make sure you're using Cycles. And then on the Feature Set here, you need to set this to Experimental. So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to click right over here on the Material Properties. I'm just going to select this object, and I'm going to click on New, and I can just call this Procedural Cheese. And then I will click and drag and drop this material on this object as well. Now I'm going to scroll down, and I'm going to go right down here to the Settings, and under Displacement, I want to change this to Displacement End Bump, and that way it'll use the displacement. And then there's one more thing I want to do. I want to go right over here to the Modifier Properties, and I want to click on Add Modifier, and I'm going to give this a subdivision surface. That way the displacement will have more geometry to work with. Now I want to use the Adaptive Subdivision, so I'm going to turn that on, and that way it'll just add more geometry where you need it. If you don't want to, you don't have to use it, but I like using the Adaptive Subdivision. And then on the Dicing Scale, I'm going to set this to like a 3. Now you can see that this cheese is now out of shape, and so to fix that, I'm going to change it from Catmull-Clark to Simple. That way it'll keep its shape, but it will still be subdivided. And then I'm going to click on this object right here, and I'm going to click on Add Modifier. We can do the same thing, so I'm going to add a Subdivision Surface Modifier, and I'll turn on the Adaptive Subdivision. And then for the Dicing Scale, I'm going to change that to 4. Alright, so now that that is all set up, we can do the procedural material. So I'm going to click over on the Shading tab, so I just have the 3D view right here. I'll go into Rendered Mode just so that we can preview that, and then I've added the procedural cheese on both of these objects. And then while we're working with the procedural nodes, I will be using the Node Wrangler add-on, so if you don't have that enabled, you can go to Edit, and go to the Preferences, and then under the Add-ons, you can search for Node Wrangler, and just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, I want to add those holes in the cheese, so to do that, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi Texture, and I'm going to drop the Voronoi right down here. Now using the feature from the Node Wrangler add-on, you can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on Nodes, and that is going to preview the node. You can see that the Voronoi Texture has these little circles here, and that's what we're going to use for the little holes in the cheese. Now using the other feature from the Node Wrangler, I'm going to select the Voronoi, and I'm going to press Ctrl-T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now we don't actually need the mapping, so I'm going to select it, and then I will press the X key to delete it, and then I actually want to use the object coordinates instead of generated. So the default is generated, you can see if I plug the texture coordinate up to generated, nothing changes, but instead I want to use the object coordinates, and when you change it to object, now you can see that the texture is placed around the object more evenly. And then you can also see that the scale isn't correct, the scale is different, so it's smaller here and bigger here. That is because I just need to Shift select both of these objects, and then I need to apply the scale. So I'm going to press Ctrl-A, and I want to apply the scale, and now the scale is the same, so the Voronoi will look the same on both of the objects. All right, so this doesn't really look like cheese, and so to change the colors, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a ColorRamp node. So we can drop this ColorRamp node right in here, and just Ctrl-Shift and click on it if you need to, and we can now change these colors, and that's going to change the base color for our cheese. So I'm going to take the white color right here, just click on that white tab, I'm going to click on this color, and then I'm going to make it a yellow color, a cheesy yellow color. And if you'd like to use the exact same color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex, and you can type in FFC243. So that is the exact color that I will be using. Now we still have this black color right here, and that is not what I want, so I'm going to click on this black color, and I'm going to make this to a yellow color as well. So I'm going to turn it way up, and then I'll make it a yellowy color. But this color is going to be a little bit less saturated, slightly darker, and a little bit more towards the orange. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using on this one here, the hex value for this color is E6A038. All right, so that is looking a lot more like cheese, so I'm going to take the color, and I'm going to plug that into the base color. And then again, the node wrangler feature, if you control shift and select different nodes, that is going to preview the node. Now cheese is usually pretty shiny, so on the roughness value right here, I'm going to change this to a 0.3. Now to make this cheese look a little bit more realistic, I do want to add a little bit of subsurface, and that is going to allow a little bit of light to go through the cheese. So on the subsurface scattering, I'm going to turn this value up to a 0.4. So this is the subsurface, and you can see that now a little bit of light is going through the object. Now we can change the subsurface color, because right now it's kind of giving it a white tint, but I don't really want a white tint. I'm going to click on this, and because it's cheese, I want to make it kind of an orangey color. And then again, if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, over here on the hex value, you can type in E75400. So that's the color that I'm using, just a nice reddish orangish color. So you can see now just a little bit of light is being let through the cheese. Now this cheese is super smooth, and I do want it to look a little bit bumpy, so I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's just click on the noise texture, drop it down here, and then I can control shift and select it to preview it. And then I want to take the object, and I want to put that into the vector. Now I'm going to leave the scale at 5 on the noise texture, but the detail I'm going to turn all the way up to max, which is 15. So lots of detail. So I now want to put the noise texture into the normal to give it just a little bit of bump. So I'm going to click and drag on the factor, and I'm going to plug the wire into the normal. Now if you control shift and click back on the final material, you can see that there's definitely some problems here. There's some weird shading issues, and that's because we need to convert this to normal data. Because this is black and white data, but this needs to be normal data. So to convert this, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a bump node, and we're going to drop the bump node right in here. And then we actually need to take the factor and put that into the height, because we're converting black and white data to normal data. So now if you look closely at this cheese, you can see that it's nice and bumpy. Now cheese is usually pretty smooth, that's quite bumpy, so I'm going to make it very subtle. So on the bump strength here, I'm going to change the strength to a 0.03. So 0.03, and now it's going to be much more subtle, and it is kind of hard to see. So you could turn it up a little bit more if you wanted to, but I like 0.03. It's really hard to actually see it in the preview, but once we render this with more samples, you will be able to see just a tiny little bit of bump over the object. Alright, so this is starting to look like cheese, but we don't have those little holes. So to add the holes, I need to press shift A, and I'm going to search for the displacement node, and I'm going to click on this displacement, and I'm just going to drop it down here. To actually have the displacement take effect, I need to plug the displacement into the displacement output here in the material output. Now right now, we haven't really given it any information, so it's kind of acting really weird right now, but we need to actually give it some information to tell it where it's going to be displaced. Now if you control shift and click on this, you can see that we already have a map of where those holes are for the cheese. So I'm going to take this distance right here, and I'm going to plug it in the height value of the displacement. Now if you control shift and click back on the final material, you can see it's definitely doing something, but it's way too strong. So on the mid-level right here on the displacement, I'm going to turn the mid-level to 0, and then I'm also going to turn the scale down to a 0.5, so it's much less strong. And that is looking better, but I need to control that a bit better. If I control shift and click on the voronoi texture, you can see that it's not very contrasty, and I want to make it much more contrasty so that it's more clear where the holes are and where they are not. So to make it more contrasty, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. Let's select the color ramp, and I'm going to drop it in this wire between the distance and the height. So I'll just drop it in here, and I can just kind of bring it down right there. And then I can control shift and click back on the final material. So now if I take this white tab, and if I start to drag it way out, you can see that the holes are only going to be in certain places. And that is because if I control shift and select the color ramp, you can see that it's much more contrasty. So where it's white, it's going to be popped out more, but then when it gets darker and darker, it's not going to be affected as much by the displacement. So if I control shift and select this, you can see where the holes are, it's not coming out, but then the rest of the cheese is coming out. So you can play around with this color ramp to change the shape of the holes, but I find that something like this looks pretty good. So I have the black tab all the way over here, and then I have the white tab about here. Now there are a few problems. One problem is that there are too many holes, and the holes are too small. So if you go right up back here to the voronoi texture, I'm going to change the voronoi texture scale to a 1.9. So I'm going to change it to 1.9, and that way the holes are much bigger, and that looks a lot better. Now another problem that we're having here is the cheese looks kind of bloated, and it's not really keeping its shape, and that is because the displacement wants to displace things out, but not back in. Now one way that we can fix this is we can change the mid-level. So right here on the displacement, if you start to turn the mid-level up, you can see that the cheese is going to get more of its regular shape. So I've found that a mid-level of 0.72 works pretty good, and that way you can see that the cheese mostly keeps its shape. It is maybe slightly bumpy on the edges, but it's pretty sharp for the most part. Now if you do it too much, you can see that there's going to be some shading issues, and that is because the mesh is kind of going through itself. So just make sure that you don't turn it up too far. And then you can also play around with the scale. So if you want the holes to be a little bit deeper, you could maybe change this up to like a 0.7, or you could turn it down to maybe just like a 0.3. You can play around with this and get it to your liking. I find that a 0.5 looks pretty good. Now one other thing you can do is you can change where the holes are located. So right up here, after the texture coordinate, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a mapping node. I'm going to click on the mapping, and I'm going to drop it right in here. So the object is going through the mapping, and then it's going into the vector of the Voronoi. So if you now just take the location values, you can just change the location values, and you can see that it's going to change where the holes are. So you can just play around with this until you get it to something that you like. And that is the finished procedural cheese material. So I just gave this a render, and here is the final result. So that's going to be it for this tutorial. Thank you so much for watching, and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial.

You can use the model inspector to preview the wireframe, matte cap, textures, and more before your purchase. You can also apply to sell your own 3D models. Check out Sketchfab with the link below. All right, now to preview the procedural material, I just added an icosphere and a monkey head, and I just subdivided them and shaded them smooth. And then also to get some very nice lighting, I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com. So I just added in this HDRI in the world to get some very realistic lighting and reflections on our metal. And if you'd like to download this HDRI, it's a free HDRI, and I'll have the link in the description. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you don't have that enabled, you can click on edit and then open up the user preferences. And then if you go over to the add-ons tab, you can search for the Node Wrangler add-on and just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So I have the 3D viewport right here and the shader editor right here. So I'm just going to click on new to add a new material. All right, so to start off, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to go to the search, and I'm going to search for a voronoi texture. And let's drop this down here. And then let's also go into rendered mode by pressing Z, moving your mouse up and letting go. Now I want to preview the voronoi texture, so I'm going to hold down the control and shift key and click. And that is using the Node Wrangler add-on, so it's going to preview different nodes if you control shift and click on the nodes. So just control shift and click on the voronoi texture. And then also make sure the voronoi is selected, and I'm going to press control T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now we don't actually need this mapping node, so I can press X to delete it with it selected. And then I want to plug the object up to the vector, and that way the voronoi texture will be placed more evenly around the object. Now I actually want to control shift and click on the voronoi texture twice, so that we can see the color instead of the distance. So you can now see that the material has some little chunks of color, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to change it from this one down here with the E, I'm going to change it to the bottom one that starts with an M. I have no idea how to pronounce this, but I'm going to change it to this bottom one here. And you can see now that I've done that, those chunks of color are still there, but they have some little imperfections and some sharp spots. And then I'm also going to change this scale here up to 60, so that it has much more detail. All right, so I can now use this texture data, and I can put that into the roughness to change the roughness of the metal. So I'm going to take this color right here, and I can stick it into the roughness. Let's just maybe bring these a bit closer, and then I can control shift and click on the principle to preview it. Now this isn't really looking like metal right now, so to make it look more like metal, I'm going to turn the metallic value all the way up to one, so it looks much more like metal. And then I will also take the base color, and I'm going to turn that down a little bit, just so that it's a bit more of a gray color. So if you zoom in here, you can see that the Voronoi texture is definitely affecting the roughness, because some parts are more shiny, and some parts are more rough. The problem with this is that it's too contrasty, and so I want to control how rough and how shiny it is. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A, and we can search for a color ramp node. Let's click on the color ramp, and I'm going to drop it right in here. So if I control shift and click twice on the Voronoi, you can see right now it's just different colors, but if I now control shift and click on the color ramp, it's now converting it just to black and white. And we can now change the different colors from black to white, and the different colors in the color ramp will affect how rough the metal is. So I'm going to control shift and click back on the principle, so I can preview it. So I'm going to take this black tab, and I'm going to turn it up quite a bit. And when I start to turn it up, when I make it more and more light, you can see that now the metal is much more rough. But that's a little bit too rough, so I'm just going to bring it down somewhere around here. So you can see it is a little bit shiny in some areas. And then I'm going to click over on the white tab, and I'm going to turn this white tab down to make the lighter areas a bit darker, so they're a little bit more shiny. So I'll bring them down to something like that. Now when I was creating this material, I did play around a lot with these colors. So if you'd like to use the exact same colors that I'm using, you can click on this first one here, the darker one, and you can click over here on the hue saturation value, the HSV. And then if you turn the value up and down, that's going to change the brightness of it. So for this first one, I'm going to make the value a value of 0.192. So that is the first one, this darker one over here. And then for this one, this one is slightly lighter. So if you click on that, open up this one right here, and just go over to the hue saturation value. I'm going to change the value to a 0.349. So now I also want this texture to contribute to the bump just a little bit. So I'm going to take this color, and I'm going to plug it into the normal. Now this is color data, and this is normal data, because this is yellow and this is purple. So we need to convert this to normal data. So to convert it, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a bump node. And let's just drop the bump node right in here between the color and the normal. And then because this is color data, I actually want to plug the color into the height, and then it'll convert it to normal data. And now if you zoom in here, you can see that it looks like those little pieces are kind of popping out. Now that is way too strong. So on the strength here, I'm going to turn this down to a 0.05. So it's much less strong, but if you zoom way in there, you can see just on the edges, it looks like it's kind of popping out a little bit, and there's just a small texture there. So that's looking pretty good, but I do just want to give a tiny little bit of noise over this metal. So I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for another noise texture. And we're just going to put the new noise texture right down there. And then I can plug the object up to the vector. And then we can control shift and click on the noise texture to preview it. So I'm going to turn the scale to 20. And then I'm also going to turn the detail all the way up to 16. So it has a lot of detail. So now what I want to do is just plug this into the bump just to give a tiny little bit of bump all over. So I'm going to take this, and I'm going to press shift D, and I'm going to duplicate that bump, and I want to drop it down here. So you can just have the normal go through the normal. So now we have this extra height value that we can add data into. So I'm going to take this factor right here from the noise texture, and I'm going to plug it into the bump. And then I can just control shift and click back on the final material. And you can see that that noise texture is just adding a bunch of little noise all over the metal. Now that is a little bit too strong for me. You could have it kind of rough like that if you want to, but I'm going to turn this strength value on the second bump. I'm going to turn the strength down to a value of 0.03. And that way it's even more subtle. So it's still there. You can still see there's some noise all over, but it is more subtle. And there we have it. So there is the finished rendered material. So that's going to be it for this tutorial. Thank you so much for watching, and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial.

You can use the model inspector to preview the wireframe, matcap, textures, and more before your purchase. You can also apply to sell your own 3D models. Check out Sketchfab with the link below. Now in the 3D space, I just added an icosphere, and I subdivided it, and then shaded it smooth. And then also for the lighting, over here in the world settings, I added in this Machineshop 021K HDRI, and this is from polyhaven.com, so the link is in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. And then I also added in this mesh object right here, and I gave it an emission material to give some nice bright lighting on our object. And if you're using Blender Eevee, you could also just add a regular light. And then I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial, so if you don't have that enabled, you can just go to Blender's preferences, and under add-ons, you can just search for the Node Wrangler add-on and just enable that, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So let's just add a new material, and I can just call this Sandstone. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a Musgrave texture. So let's just drop the Musgrave texture right here, and then using the Node Wrangler add-on, if I hold down the Ctrl and Shift key, I can click on nodes to preview them. And then I also want to select the Musgrave texture, and I'm going to press Ctrl-T, again using another feature from the Node Wrangler, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I don't actually need the mapping, so I'm going to click on it and then press X to delete it. And then I want to use the object coordinates, so I'll plug the object into the vector, and that'll place the texture around the object more evenly. So on the Musgrave texture, I'm going to turn this detail all the way up to 15, so it has more detail in there. And then I'll turn the dimension down to 0, and you can see when I turn it down, it starts to add all this little grainy detail in there. Now I want to use a different texture to actually distort the placement of this texture, so I'm going to press Shift-A, and again I'm going to search for a noise texture, and we're going to drop the noise texture in between the connection of the texture coordinate and the Musgrave. And so what the noise texture is doing is it's distorting the Musgrave texture. And then I'm going to turn the scale up to 6 on the noise, and I'll turn the detail up to 15, so it has lots more detail. And then I'll also turn this roughness value all the way up to 1, so it has a lot more detail. So now if you zoom in here, we just have tons of little detail there in our texture. So let's now take this black and white data, this height value, and we're going to plug that into the base color of our principled, and then I can Ctrl-Shift and click on the principled to preview it. Now that doesn't look anything like sandstone, so I want to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, and we're going to drop the color ramp right in here between the Musgrave and the principled, and then we can change the colors in the color ramp, and that'll change the colors for the texture. So I'm going to select the black tab, and then right here I can change its color. So I'm going to make it a bit brighter, and then I'm going to make it a brown color. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, I'll show you all the hex values for these colors. So for this first one, if you click over on the hex value, you can type in 784323, so just kind of a nice brown color. Then I'm going to hold my mouse right about here, and I will hold down the Ctrl key and click, and that is going to add a new tab. And then this one, I also want to be a brown color, so let's make it a brown color, but I want to make it just slightly brighter and also slightly more red. And the hex value for this one is 985126. And then I'm going to do the same thing right around here, so I'll Ctrl and click right in here, and that'll add a new tab. And then this one, I want to be kind of a peachy color. And I'll bring this one over, kind of going towards the orange values, but it's still going to be not super saturated, so more towards the white. And the hex value for this color is a value of F09467. So this is starting to look better, but this is sandstone, so I do want to make it look kind of like sand, so I want to add a yellow value. So on this last one here, this white one, I'm going to click on the color, and I'm going to make it a yellowy color. And this yellow color will be pretty saturated, but not super saturated, and a little bit more orange. And the hex value for this one is FF9D44. Now you can see that this material is actually pretty shiny, and I don't want it to be that shiny, because this is sandstone, so it's going to be pretty dry. So I'm going to turn this roughness here, the roughness value, to a 0.7, so it's much less shiny. So that is looking pretty cool, but I want to give it some bump, because right now the material is still very flat. So the first thing that I want to do is I want to give it some bump to make it look like there's little bits of sand. So to do that, I'll press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture, and I'll drop the Voronoi down here, and then again I want to plug the object up to the vector on the Voronoi. Then to preview what this is looking like, I can Ctrl-Shift and click on the Voronoi. And you can see this Voronoi texture has a bunch of little dots kind of randomly placed around, so we're going to use this to look like little bits of sand. Now I want to turn the scale up to something really high, like a 300. So now if you zoom in really close, you can see there's just little bits of sand, and that looks quite nice. So now I want to put this into the normal. So what I'm going to do is take the distance value, and I'm going to put that into the normal. Now this is black and white data, but this needs to be normal data. So if I Ctrl-Shift and click on it, you can see there's some shading issues, and that's because we haven't converted this to normal data. So to convert this black and white data to normal data, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for the bump node. Now we're going to drop this bump node right in here between the distance and the normal. And then what we need to do for this black and white data is we need to take the distance and put that into the height, and that'll actually convert it to normal data. So if you zoom in there, you can see now it looks like it's bumping out. Now currently it actually looks like the little grains of sand are kind of going back in, and I don't really want that, so I'm going to click on the invert button, and now it looks like it just has a bunch of little dots. And then it is really quite strong right now, so I'm going to turn the strength value down to a 0.3, so it's much less strong. And if you zoom out now, you can see there's a bunch of surface detail over that material. Now I also want to give it some general noise all over the place, and I'll put that through the bump as well. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for another noise texture, and let's drop the noise texture down here. And then just like all of these textures, I want to put the object into the vector. And then let's Ctrl-Shift and click on the noise texture so that we can preview that. So I'm going to turn the scale up to 15, and then I'll turn the detail all the way up to 15, so it has a bunch of detail. And then I'll also turn the roughness up to 0.6, and you can see adding more roughness gives it a little bit more detail. So I now want to take this bump node, and I want to press Shift-D to duplicate it, and I'm going to stick it right in here between the connection. So we now have two bump nodes, and the first bump is going into the normal of the second bump. So we now have this other height value that we can add data into, so I'm going to take the factor, this black and white data on the noise texture, and I'm going to plug that up to the height. So if I Ctrl-Shift and click on this bump, you can zoom in here and you can see it's adding a bunch of detail all around. Now I don't want the invert to be turned on, so I'm going to click on this to turn the invert off. And then I can back up here, Ctrl-Shift and click on the principle to preview it, and you can see now there's just a bunch of little noise all around the material. So we are actually almost done, but there's one more thing that I want to do. I want to give it some larger bump, so I just want to give it some more randomness, just some bigger bumps here and there, just to make it a little bit more organic and natural. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for one more noise texture, and I'll just drop the noise texture down here, and then just like all the other ones, let's plug the object coordinates up to the vector. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and click on the noise texture to preview it. Now for this last noise texture, I actually don't want very much detail, because I'm going to use this noise texture to make the material look a little bit lumpy. So I'm going to turn the detail down to zero, and when I turn the detail down to zero, now you can see that that noise texture is much more smooth. And then I'll also turn the scale up to eight, so there's a little bit more of that texture. So I can now do the same exact thing, so I can plug this noise texture into the bump. So I'm going to take this bump node, and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate, and I'm going to drop it right down here. So then the normal can go through the normal, so now we have another height value. So we're going to take the factor from this last noise texture, and we're going to plug that into the height. So if I now Ctrl-Shift and click on this, you can see this is what it's doing, so it's adding in some bumps here and there. So let's Ctrl-Shift and click back on the principal to preview that, and you can see that it is a bit too strong. So on this strength right here, I'm going to turn it down to like a 0.15. So now you can still see it, like right here, you can definitely see that there's some bumps here and there, but it is much more subtle. And that is it for the procedural sandstone material. So I'll just give this a final render. Alright, and there is the finished rendered material. So thank you for watching this tutorial, and I hope you found it helpful.

The tutorial also includes tips on adjusting material properties for realism, such as subsurface scattering and bump mapping. Additionally, the creator promotes purchasing the tutorial files, their procedural material packs, and thanks the video's sponsor, Sketchfab.","In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural peppermint candy material in Blender. Now, if you'd like to help support me and my YouTube channel, you can purchase the tutorial files on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page, and that is a great way to help support me. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials, or if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then you can check out the procedural material playlist on YouTube. All the links are in the description. And then before we start, I wanted to thank this video's sponsor, Sketchfab. Sketchfab is an awesome 3D model site where you can preview 3D models in your browser. You can even view them on a phone, tablet, or in AR and VR. They also have a huge 3D model store where you can purchase models and assets. You can even apply to sell your own models on the platform. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. All right, so real quick, I'm going to show you how I've set this up in the 3D space. So, what I did is I pressed Shift-A, and I just added a plane, and I just moved the plane over, just so that I can preview the final material on a plane. And then also, I can press Shift-A, and I'm going to go right here, and I'm going to add an icosphere. And then right behind me, if you open up the add icosphere settings, I turn these subdivisions up to five, so that it's pretty subdivided. And then I just shaded it smooth, just so that we can preview the material on a sphere. And then also, because this is a peppermint candy material, I thought I'd model just a basic peppermint candy. So, to do that, I'll press Shift-A, and I'm going to add a circle. And then I'm going to tab into edit mode, and I'll just press F to fill a face. Then I can press G to grab, and Z to bring it up on the Z-axis. And then I can press E to extrude, and I'm going to extrude it down on the Z-axis. And then what you can do is you can press Control-B, and Control-B is going to add a bevel, and you can scroll your mouse wheel up to add more cuts, and then just click to place that. And then I can also hold down the Alt key and select this ring of vertices, and I can do the same thing. So I'll just press Control-B, and then just scroll your mouse wheel to make those cuts, just like that. And then I'll just shade this smooth. And then also, right over here on the modifier properties, just to subdivide this, I'm going to click on add modifier, and I'm going to add the subdivision surface with the render and viewport to one, just so that it's kind of smooth. And then for the lighting, right over here on the world, I added in this Machineshop 021K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com, so if you'd like to use the same HDRI, I'll have the links in the description. So I'm just going to click on new here, and I'm just going to call this procedural peppermint candy. And then what I can do is I can click and drag, and I can drop this material on these different objects, and that way the same material will be on all three objects. And then in this tutorial, I will also be using the Node Wrangler add-on, so if you don't have that enabled, you can just go right up here to edit and open up the preferences. And then if you click right over here on add-ons, over here on the search, you can type in a node, and then just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So to start off, I want to create that red and white stripe texture. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a gradient texture, and I'll just drop this down here, and then using the Node Wrangler, I can control shift and click on nodes to preview it. And then I don't want this to be set to linear, so I'm going to click on this, and I'm going to change it to radial. And then also using the other Node Wrangler feature, I'm just going to select this, and I'll press control T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I want to use the object coordinates, not generated, so I'm going to plug object into the vector here on the mapping. And now you can see that we have one of those stripes in our texture. Now one stripe isn't what we want, we want to have a bunch of stripes, and we want all the stripes to be going around the object. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a math node, and let's just drop the math node right here. So now what I can do is I can click on the add, and I'm going to change it to fraction. So it's right down here under rounding, if you go down here, it's fraction, so I'm going to turn this to fraction. But you can see that we still don't have any more stripes, so to create more stripes, I'm going to click on the fraction, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it down here. And then instead of this being set to fraction, I'm going to click on the fraction right here, and I'm going to change it to multiply. So it's right here under functions, just change it to multiply. So now if you turn this value up, it's going to duplicate that and spin it around. And whatever number you set this to, that is how many stripes there's going to be. So for something like this, I think 13 looks pretty good. So I'm going to change the value to 13. And now there are 13 of those stripes. Now with peppermint candy, there usually is a bit of a swirl, because right now the stripes are just straight, and they're just going straight into the center, but they're not swirling. So to make it swirl, I want to bring the texture coordinate over here. And then I want to click on this gradient texture, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it, and I want to drop it down here. And then I can control shift and click on it to preview it. So to make the stripes spin around, I want to affect this rotation value so that the stripes are rotated. So I'm going to take the color right here on this gradient texture, and I'm going to plug that into rotation. And then if I control shift and click back on the fraction, you can see it is doing something, but that's not really what I want. So if I go back over here to this gradient texture, I want to change it from radial to spherical. And then if I control shift and click on this, you can see what it's doing. So now the gradient texture is a sphere. The problem with this is that it's moved over sideways. And so if I control shift and click back on the fraction, you can see this is all warped, and it's not rotating in the correct spot. So to fix that, I'm going to take the object right here, and I'm going to plug that into the vector on the gradient texture. And now if you control shift and click on the gradient texture, you can see that that sphere is in the center. So just control shift and click back on the fraction, and you can see now it's rotating in the right spot. But there still are a few more problems, because you can see right here, this is kind of offset. If I select this object and tab into edit mode, I can press G to grab and Z on the Z-axis, and you can see when I bring it up and down on the Z-axis, it's actually changing. And that is because this gradient texture changes depending on where the object is in the 3D space. If I control shift and click on the gradient texture and then move it up and down, you can see that it starts to get brighter, and then as you bring it up, it gets darker. So what I want to do is I want to only use the Z values. So I'm going to control shift and click back on the fraction. So I only want to use the Z values of the gradient texture. So what I'm going to do is press shift A, and I'm going to search for a combine XYZ. So I'm going to take the combine XYZ, and I'm going to stick it right here. And then I want to take this color, and I want to put that into the Z. So now that I've done that, you can see that it's rotating quite nicely, and the rotation is in the very center of all these objects. Now I do want to be able to control how much it's rotating. So to control that, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for another math node, and I want to drop the math node right in here. And then I don't want it to be set to add. I want to click on this, and right up here under functions, I want to change it to a multiply. So now if you change this value right here on the multiply, that is going to determine how rotated the stripes are. And then right over here on the sphere, you can see that it's not actually being rotated, and that is because this sphere isn't flat. If I tap into edit mode on the sphere, and then scale it on the Z axis, as I start to scale it down, and as it gets more and more flat, you can see that it's starting to be more of a swirl. So at the end of this tutorial, I will show you how to fix this. I'll show you how to change it, so that even when this sphere is rotated, and it's not flat, it'll still have the swirls. So on this multiply here, I'm going to change it to a value of 2, because I think that looks pretty good. I don't want to overdo it, I just want to change it to a value of 2. Alright, so we now have a really nice stripe texture. So what I want to do now, is I want to plug this value right in here into the base color on the principled, and then I can ctrl shift and click on the principled. So now what I want to do, is I want to change the colors, and then that way it'll look more like a peppermint candy. So to change the colors, I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a color ramp node, and let's just drop the color ramp node right in here. So I'm first going to click on the black tab, and I'm going to click on the minus to get rid of it. And then I'm going to hold down my ctrl key, and click right in here, and that is going to add another tab, and I want to push the tab over, so that we have white and white on either side. So now I want to create a red one in the middle. So right about here in the middle, I'm going to hold down the ctrl key, and click to add another tab. Just kind of put it in the middle here, and then I can click on this color down here, and I'm going to make it a bright red color. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value, and you can type in a hex value of e3 0005. So that's looking pretty good, but it's not very sharp, it's quite smooth, and I also want to make the red stripe thicker. So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to hold down the ctrl key, and I'm going to click to add another tab about here, and then hold down my ctrl key, and click again to add another tab right here. And then both of these tabs, I want to make them a red color as well, but I want them to be just a little bit less saturated. And again, if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, right over here on the hex value, you can type in ff 3b 4 4. So that's the color that I will be using, and then right over here on this one, I'm going to use the same color. So now if you take a look at this, it's really starting to look like peppermint candy. Now I want to sharpen up the white values just a little bit, so I'm going to drag the white values out a little bit, or drag them in, and I'm going to drag them closer to the red values, and now you can see that that white is a bit sharper. And then you can also play around with these values, just dragging them in or out, and that way it'll change the size of the red stripes. All right, so that is looking really cool, but I also want to play around with some other things in the material, just to make it look a little bit more like candy. So the first thing that I want to do is I want to turn this roughness down to like a 0.2, because hard candy like this usually is pretty shiny, so I'll change the roughness to a 0.2. And then I also want to turn the subsurface up to a 0.3, and so the subsurface scattering is going to kind of let a little bit of light go through the hard candy. And then the subsurface color, I'm going to click on this, and I'm going to make it kind of a reddish color. But I don't want the subsurface color to be too bright, so just kind of a reddish orangey color, and not super saturated. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using over here on the hex, you can type in a hex value of E7 4A37. All right, and then the last thing that I want to do to finish off this material is I just want to give it a tiny little bit of bump, just to make it look slightly more realistic, and give it just a little bit of imperfection. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's just drop the noise texture right down here, and then I can press Ctrl T with the noise texture selected, and that'll add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I don't actually need the mapping, so I'll press X to delete it, and I'm going to plug the object up to the vector. So I can now Ctrl Shift and click on the noise texture to preview it, and I want to turn the detail all the way to the max, which is 15. And then I'm going to turn the scale down to like a two. So now we can use this value to kind of make the candy look slightly bumpy. So to do that, I'm going to plug this factor right here up to the normal. And then what I need to do is convert this to normal data, because this is black and white data, but this needs to be a normal data. So to convert it, I'm going to press Shift A, and I'm going to search for a bump node, and let's drop the bump node right in here. And then I want to plug the factor up to the height, and that way it'll convert the black and white data to normal data. So if I Ctrl Shift and click on that, you can see what it's doing. So I can now Ctrl Shift and click on this, and you can preview that material. Now it's really really strong right now, and that is way too strong. So to make it less strong, I'm going to turn the strength value to a 0.02, and that way it's very very subtle, but if you kind of look right in here in the reflections, there's just a tiny little bit of bump, and that just makes it look a little bit more realistic. And that is it for the peppermint candy material. Now one more thing that I want to do is I want to create a separate material, and I want to change the material so that this object has a swirl as well. Because if I tap in edit mode, I can scale this down, and you can see that as it starts to get more and more flat, it starts to swirl. But let me show you how to change this so that it'll work on a circular object. So what I first want to do is make it a separate material so it won't affect these materials. So I'm going to click on the sphere, and then I'm going to click on this button right here to duplicate the material. And I'm going to call this procedural peppermint candy 2. So now to change this so that it swirls, we need to go right over here, and right here behind this gradient texture, I need to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a mapping node. And I want to plug the mapping node right here, so the object is going into the vector of the mapping, and then the vector from the mapping will go into the gradient texture. And then what I want to do is I want to flatten the z values. So if you go right over here to the mapping, you can go right down here to the scale, and on this z value, I want to turn the z scale to 0. And now when I change it to 0, you can see that it's now swirling all around that object. All right, and that is it. So that is the procedural peppermint candy material.

So I'll show you how to add this landscape in Blender using a Blender add-on, and you can see if I add the material onto it, you can get this really cool Martian landscape material. And this material also looks really good as a rock material, so if you're wanting to create some sort of Martian rock, it works really well as you can see on this rock object that I've added. Now, if you'd like to help support me and this YouTube channel and purchase the tutorial files, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page, and that is a really great way to help support this YouTube channel. And then real quick before we start, this video was brought to you by my Blender procedural material packs. So if you like using procedural materials in your artwork, then definitely consider checking out these procedural material packs. So I create packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. And purchasing the material packs is also a really great way to help support this YouTube channel. Or if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials yourself, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. All the links are in the description. So before we start with the procedural material, I just wanted to show you the setup that I have in the 3D space. So for this object, I just pressed shift A and I just went right here and added an icosphere. And then right behind me on the add icosphere settings, I just subdivided this and then I shaded the object smooth. Now to get this landscape object, I use the landscape add-on in Blender. So if you want to enable it, you can just go edit and then open up the preferences. And then on the add-ons tab right over here on the search, you can start to type in land. And I just turned on the add mesh ANT landscape add-on, and that is how I added the landscape object. And then also while we're here in the user preferences, I'm also going to be using the node wrangler add-on in this tutorial. So you can just type in node right here on the search and then just check mark the node wrangler add-on. And then also if you'd like to create a rock object to put the material on, then right here on the add-ons, again, you can search for extra and you can turn on the add mesh extra objects, and this will allow you to add rocks into Blender. And then you can just close the user preferences. So now if you press shift A, you can go to mesh and you can go right down here and you can see that there is the landscape add-on. And then right behind me, if you open up those settings, there are a bunch of different settings that you can play around with to get the look of the landscape that you want. So you can turn these subdivisions up right here if you want it to be more subdivided and be more detailed. So I turn this up to like a 200. And then you can also change the mesh size. So I'm going to turn both of these up to like a five and that way it's a lot bigger. So that's basically what I did to get this object right here. And then to create the rock object, you can press shift A and go to mesh. And because we added in that other add-on, the add mesh extra objects, you can see that there is a rock generator right here. So Blender actually has a rock generator. Now I do have a more detailed video on how to use this add-on. If you'd like to check that out, I'll throw the card right up there on the screen and the link in the video description. And so I just use that add-on to create this rock object. And then for the lighting, I just added a sunlight and just pointed it at the sphere. So now let's get started with the procedural material. So I'm just going to click on new here and I'm just going to name this rocky planet. All right. So to start off, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's just drop the noise texture right down here. And then because we turned on the node wrangler add-on, you can press control T with the noise texture selected, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping, but then I don't need the mapping. So I'll click on it and I'm going to press X to delete it. And then I can just plug the object up to the vector so that we're using the object coordinates and then also using the other feature from the node wrangler. I can hold down the control and shift key and I can click on nodes and that is going to preview the node. So I'm going to start off by creating the main surface color. So I'll take the scale here and I'm going to change that to 20 and then I'll turn the detail all the way up to 16. So it's very detailed. And then I'll also turn the roughness up to a 0.6 so it has more roughness. And then I can take the factor and I can plug that into the base color and then I can control shift and click on the principle to preview it. Now this doesn't really look like a rocky planet, so I want to change the colors in between here to make it look more like a rocky planet. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to add a color ramp node and let's drop the color ramp node right in between here. And then we can change the colors in here in the color ramp and that's going to change the color of the rocky planet. So I'm going to click on the white tab and I'm going to drag the white tab over here. And then I'm going to click on the color down here and I'll make it a darker color and then I'll make it a bit red and I'll make it even darker. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using the hex value for this color is 642F26. So you can just put that number into the hex value and then that'll get you the same exact color that I'm using. And then I'm going to hold down my control key and I'm going to click right about here to add another tab and then this one I'm going to make it even darker. But I don't want it to be fully black I just want it to be pretty dark so something like that. Now this entire procedural node setup does get a little bit big by the end and so I want to be able to organize my nodes and that way it won't be as confusing. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a frame. So I'm going to drop the frame down here and then I can click and drag and I can drop nodes into the frame. And this way you can click on the frame and you can drag it around and it's a nice way to organize the nodes. And then if you click on the frame you can press N and N is going to open up the side panel right here and then you can name the frame. So I'm going to actually name this to main surface and then you can press N to close the side panel. And you can see now this frame has a label and so that's really great for organizing our nodes. So I'm actually going to take this frame and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it down here and then I can press N again to open up the side panel. And this one I'm going to call mountains and then I'll press N to close the panel because I want to create some mountains and then add the mountains into the final material. So to create the mountains I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for a voronoi texture and let's drop the voronoi texture right in here into the frame of the mountains. And then I can take the object and I can plug that up to the vector. And then to preview it I'm going to control shift and click on it to preview that. So then on this voronoi texture I'm going to change this right down here to this one. I don't know how to pronounce it but it starts with an M it's right down here at the bottom. Now I want to use another texture in here to distort this texture. So to do that I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a noise texture and let's drop the noise texture right in here between the object and the vector. And then I can drag over and drop it into the mountains frame. And then this is really important make sure that the color is going into the vector of the voronoi texture. So I'm going to change the scale to 2 and then I'll turn the detail all the way up to the max which is 15. And if you zoom in here you can see that this is starting to look kind of like mountain ranges on some kind of alien planet. So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to add a math node and I'm going to drop the math node right here and then I can drag it into the mountain frame. And then I'm going to click on the add and I'm going to go right down here and I'm going to change this to the hyperbolic tangent. And then right over here on the scale I want to change this scale to 1. And now the color there is much more subtle and that is what I want. So now I want to add the mountains into the normal to give it some bump but I also want to add it into the color. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a mix RGB. Let's just drop the mix RGB right here and then I can put it into the main surface. And then I'm going to take the value here from the math node and I'm going to put that into the factor. And then I'm actually going to take this color and put it into color 2 and then I can control shift and click on it so you can see what we're doing. And so now because we've added this into the factor now this color is going to be those mountains. So you can change this color and it's going to change those mountaintops. So I want to make it kind of a tan color, kind of a peachy tan color. And the hex value that I'm using for this color is a hex value of FFB5A4. So now you can see those mountains are just peeking out of the color. Now I also want the mountains to contribute to the bump. So I'm going to take the value and I'm going to plug that into the normal but then I need to convert this to normal data because if I control shift and click on it you can see those shading issues. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a bump node and we're going to drop the bump node right in here between the value of the math node and the normal. And this way it's going to convert this black and white data to normal data. So we need to plug the value up to the height and then the normal can go into the normal. And now you can see what that's doing and that's looking much more cool. Now it's a bit too strong so I'm going to change the strength down to a 0.4 so it's much less strong. And then I also want to invert it so I'm going to hit up hit the invert button. Now it looks like those mountainy areas are kind of popping out. So now I just want to give this entire object a little bit of noise kind of some bump all over the place. So I'm going to take this bump and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and I'll just drop it down here. And then I want the normal to be going into the normal. So now we have this height value that we can add data into. So I'm going to take this color and I'm going to plug it into the height and then I don't want it to be inverted so I'm going to turn off the invert. And then it's way too strong right now so I'm going to turn the strength value down to a 0.15 and that looks much better. Now you can also see that this planet does look kind of shiny and that doesn't look very realistic especially if this is like a large scale planet and those are like giant mountains. So on the roughness value here I'm going to turn this roughness to a 0.7 and that way it is much more rough and that does look more realistic. All right so now I want to create some small craters and add those onto the material. So I'm going to select the mountain frame and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it down here and then if I open up the side panel with N I can go right here to the node tab and I can just rename this and I'm going to name this small craters. So to create the small craters I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to start with a voronoi texture and I'll just drop it in here and then I can plug the object again up to the vector and then I can control shift and click on the voronoi texture to preview it. So I'm going to change the scale up to 250 and that way we have a bunch of small little craters but I want to make it more contrasty because it's not very contrasty so I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp and then let's just drop the color ramp right in here and then bring it into the small craters and you can just control shift and click on the color ramp. So I can now drag these two tabs closer to each other and that's going to make it more contrasty. So I want to bring this one over here and this one kind of over there just like that. Now I don't want the small craters to be all over the place I just want them to be in a few patchy areas here and there so I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to add a noise texture. Let's just drop the noise texture right in here into these small craters and put it down here and then again I want to bring this down and I want to plug the object into the vector and then let's control shift and click on the noise texture to preview it. So I'll turn the detail level all the way up to 15 and then I'll turn the roughness up to a 0.6. So I'm going to use this noise texture as a mask just to tell it where the craters are actually going to be but this is not going to work very well as a mask because it's not very contrasty. So I'm going to take the color ramp and I'll press shift D to duplicate, drop it down here and I can then plug the factor up to the factor on the color ramp and then I can control shift and click to preview the color ramp. And then I want to make this very contrasty so I'm going to drag these two values pretty close to each other and I'll bring them out kind of right here. So this is now going to work much better for a mask. So I can now press shift A and I'm going to search for a mix RGB to combine these together. So I'm going to put the mix right in here in the small craters and I'm also just going to bring some of these out a little bit so we have a little bit more space. All right just like that. So I want to plug this bottom color ramp up to color 2 and then I want to plug the top color ramp up to color 1 and then I don't want this to be set to mix so I'm going to change it to lighten. So right here just change that to lighten. So now if you zoom in here you can see that where the noise texture is white you're not able to see the craters as well. Now I don't want to be able to see the craters at all so I'm going to take the factor value and turn that all the way up to one and that way now you can just see the small craters in some areas here and there. So I now just want to add this to the normal. So I'm going to take this bump and I'll press shift D to duplicate it drop it down here and then I can take this color and I can plug that into the height value of our new bump and let's just control shift and click on the bump to preview it and I'm just going to bring it up here and I need to move this out of the way so I have a little bit more space and then I need to plug this bump into the other bumps. So I'm going to take the normal and plug that into the normal on this bump and then this color is going into the height. So now if I control shift and click on the final material I can just zoom in here and you can see there's some little craters. Now right now they're popping out and I don't want that and that is because the invert was turned on so I'm going to turn the invert off and now the craters look like they're going back in and then I'm also going to change the strength down to like a 0.25 and that way it's a bit less strong and then just make sure to press control s to save your project as you're working on it. All right so now I want to create some more land detail so I'm going to click on the frame right here and I'll press shift D to duplicate it drop it down here and then again you can press n to open up the side panel and I want to change this to a land detail land detail all right and then I'll close that. So to create the land detail I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for the magic texture and I'll just drop the magic texture down here and then I can control shift and click on it to preview it. Now I want to turn the depth all the way up to 10 because that one works best and then I'll turn the scale to like a 2.8. Now I want to distort this magic texture so I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to add a noise texture and we're going to use the noise texture to distort the magic texture. So I'm going to drag it into the land detail and then I'll plug the color up to the vector and then also again right here I want to plug the object from the texture coordinate I want to plug the object up to the vector on the noise texture and then on the noise texture I'm going to turn the scale to 6 and then I'll turn the detail all the way up to 15 and then I'll turn the roughness value also up to a 0.6 just so that it has a bit more roughness. Now I want to be able to control this much better and I also want to make it black and white so I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp now let's drop the color ramp right down here and I can plug it into the land detail and just ctrl shift and click on the color ramp. So I'm now going to drag these two tabs very close to each other to make it much more contrasty so I'll just drag them to somewhere right about here and then I want to plug this into the bump as well so I'm going to take this bump and I'll press shift D to duplicate and I'll drop it right down here. So I just want the normal to be going through the normal and then again the normal to go through the normal through these bumps so we now have this height value that we can plug more data into so I'm going to take the color and I'm going to put that into the height and then if you ctrl shift and click on it you can see what it's doing and then I want to turn the strength up a little bit so I'm going to turn the strength up to a 0.3. All right so back up here let's ctrl shift and click on the final material again just to see how that's looking. So if I select the bump node and press M that is going to mute it and you can see there's a lot less detail now but then if I select the bump node again and press M to turn it back on you can see that's what it's doing so it's adding a lot more detail all around the material. All right and then there's just one more group of nodes that we're going to be creating we're going to be creating some large craters so what I can do is I can actually just use the small craters to create the large craters so I'm going to press B for the box select and I'm going to box select all of these nodes and also shift and select the small crater frame so now that I have all of these selected I'll press shift D to duplicate and then I'm going to drop it down here and then again I want to plug the object up to the vector so if this is kind of far away you can kind of drag the texture coordinate down here and then just plug the object up to the vector on both of these nodes and then I'll just put this right back up here and then I can ctrl shift and click on this light to preview it and then also if you select the small craters frame I'm going to press N to open up this panel here and I don't want this to be small craters I want to change this to large craters and then I'll press N to close that so now we just need to change the values so on the scale here on this voronoi texture I'm going to change the scale to like a 30 and then for the noise texture I want to turn the scale up to like a 20 so if you zoom in here you can see that those craters still are a little bit small and also the noise is kind of distorting them a little bit but I want to change that so I'm going to take the white tab and just kind of drag it over a little bit to make those craters a little bit more contrasty and then I also want to drag the black tab out on the noise texture color ramp and if I drag this out kind of more towards this side you can see that it's making the craters a little bit more subtle and then instead of just mixing these together with the mix rgb I actually want to take this color this bottom one with the noise texture and I want to plug this into the factor so we're going to use it as the factor and then this color 2 right here this color is going to be fully white so basically what this noise texture is doing now is it's adding a bunch of noise kind of along the craters and that will just make it look more organic and more natural because if I control shift and click on the voronoi you can see it's perfectly smooth and perfectly round but then if I control shift and click on the light in here with the noise texture now it's just adding a bunch of noise all over those craters so I now want to plug the large craters into the final material as well so way up here I'm going to take this bump node and I'll press shift d to duplicate it and I'm going to drop it right down here in between the bump and the principled bsdf and then just make sure the normal is going into the normal so then way down here on the large craters I can drag this and put a wire all the way up here and I want to plug that into the height right here you can also drag this a bit closer if it's a bit too far away and just plug the color into the height all right so the color is going into the height and then the normal can go through the normal and then the bump node can go into the normal on the principled now let's control shift and click on the final material and just kind of zoom in here so you can see that the large craters are kind of hard to see so I'm going to turn the strength value up to a 0.4 and that way now you can see them and they're much stronger and there is the final render so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and thank you so much for watching and again if you'd like to purchase the finished procedural material and also help to support this channel then you can do that over on my gumroad store and my patreon page I'll have the links in the video description and if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials then you can check out my blender procedural material packs or if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials then you can check out my procedural material playlist on youtube so thank you for watching and I hope to see you in a future tutorial"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MieQfrfHrJY,Procedural Damaged Metal (Blender Tutorial),"In the video tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural damaged metal material in Blender using the Cycles render engine, while also noting its effectiveness in Eevee. The tutorial covers steps from adding a noise texture and adjusting colors using color ramps to configuring metallic properties and adding bump effects for realism. The creator also integrates a musgrave texture to simulate rust and adjusts roughness for detail. Additionally, the video is sponsored by Sketchfab, and viewers are encouraged to purchase project files on Gumroad or Patreon to support the channel. The tutorial is concluded by showcasing the rendered result.","In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural, damaged metal material in Blender. Now I will be using the Cycles render engine in this tutorial, but this material also looks really good in Eevee. And you can see here is the material in Eevee, and I think it looks really good in Eevee as well. Now if you'd like to purchase the project files, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page, and that's a great way to help support this channel. You can also check out my Blender procedural material packs, I'll have the link in the description, or if you'd like to learn how to create more of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. And then also, before we start, I wanted to give a huge thanks to Sketchfab for sponsoring this video. Upload and preview your own 3D models on Sketchfab. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can preview 3D models online in your browser. You can also purchase models and assets from Sketchfab's model store. You can use the model inspector to preview the wireframe, matcap, textures, and more before your purchase. You can also apply to sell your own 3D models. Check out Sketchfab with the link below. So to preview the material, I just added a sphere and a monkey head, and I added the subsurf modifiers to them and then just shaded them smooth. And then for the lighting over here on the world, I added in this Machineshop 021K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com, the link will be in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI. And it gives some really nice lighting on this damaged metal material. And then I will be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial, so to enable that, you can click on edit and then open up the preferences. And then just click over on the add-ons tab, and you can search for Node, and then you can just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. Alright, so to start off, I'm going to click on new here to add a new material, and let's press shift A, and I'm going to start by adding a noise texture, and I'll just drop it down here. And then using the Node Wrangler feature, I can select this Node, and I can press control T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I want to plug the object up to the vector on the noise texture, and then I can just click on the mapping and delete it. So by using the object coordinates, that's going to place the noise texture around the object more evenly. And then I can control shift and click on this noise texture to preview it. And then also, I want to click right here and drag and drop this material on both of these objects. So I'm going to set the scale to a 3.3, and then I'll turn this detail all the way up to 16, so it has a lot more detail. And then on the roughness value, I'm going to change this to a 0.55, so it has a bit more roughness. So now I want to change the colors in between here before we put that into the base color. So I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's drop the color ramp right here, and just plug the factor up to the factor on the color ramp. And then if you haven't already, you can control shift and click on the color ramp to preview it. So I'm going to drag the black tab out a bit, and then I'm going to drag this white tab over as well, kind of to over here. So on the black tab, I want to make this kind of a brownish grayish color. So I'm going to make it more like a gray color like this, and then I'll make it slightly over on the reddish, kind of on the reddish orangish side to make it a bit more brown. And then I do want to make it quite a bit darker than this, so I will turn the brightness down. And then if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value, and you can type in a hex value of 322C27. Now on the white tab right over here, I want to make this a bit more of a gray color, because I don't want the metal to be super bright. And the hex value that I'm using for this whitish grayish color is six C's. So you can just type in C six times. So that is looking pretty cool, but I want to kind of sharpen up the edges a little bit. So what I'm going to do is hold down my control key and then click to add another tab right here. And then I want to drag this tab very, very close to the brown tab. And you can see now that is looking much more sharp, and there's a bit more of a brown or a gray kind of around the edges. And then for this second gray color, the hex value that I'm using is 908F8E. But it's basically just a gray color with a very slight brown to it. All right, so let's plug this color into the base color, and then I can control shift and click on the principle to preview it. Now this doesn't really look like metal, and that is because we don't have the metallic value turned up. So we can turn this metallic value all the way up to one, so it looks more metallic. But I only want some parts of the material to be metallic, because these damaged parts right here, I don't want that to be metallic. I just want these lighter parts to be metallic. So I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for another color ramp. And let's drop this color ramp right down here. So I'm going to take this factor from the noise texture and plug that into the factor on this color ramp. And then I'll take this color and plug that into the metallic. So now we can use this to tell it where it's going to be metallic, and where it's not going to be metallic. So let's just control shift and click on this to preview it. So I'm going to drag the black tab out quite a bit, kind of over here. And then I'll also drag the white tab really close to it, so it's very contrasty. And because both of these color ramps have the same noise texture plugged up, you can see that if I control shift and click on this, this area right here is the same as this area right here. And then I do want to drag this out a bit, so it's a bit more contrasty. So if I hold down the control and shift key, and then click back and forth between these two color ramps, those dark patches should be in the same areas, or very similar. So now if I control shift and click on the final material, you can see that this doesn't look metallic, but then this over here does look very metallic. Now I also want to be able to control the roughness. So I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for another color ramp, and drop it down here. And then I want to plug this factor again into the color ramp right here. And I'll just bring that over underneath the other color ramps. And then I can plug the color up to the roughness, and now I can use this color ramp to control the roughness. So I want to make the damaged part look more rough, and then right over here where it's more metallic, I want that to be more shiny. So to do this, I'm going to take the black tab, and I'm going to turn it up so it's a much more of a lighter gray. And then I'm going to click on the white tab, and I'm going to make this a darker gray. And you can see when I turn this down, it's going to be more and more shiny. So the darker this is, the more shiny that's going to be. So I don't want it to be super shiny, but I do want it to be pretty shiny. So I'm just going to drag it to something like that. All right, so this material is starting to look pretty cool, but I want to give it some bump, because right now it's very shiny, and I want these damaged parts to look like they're going back in. So what I'm first going to do is press shift A, and I'm going to search for a bump node, and I want to use a few different layers of bump. So I first just want to take the factor and plug that into the height value on this bump, because I just want to have an overall amount of detail just to make the metal look like it's very damaged and old. So once the factor is plugged into the height, I can plug this bump normal into the normal on the principal. And that way it's just going to give the entire thing lots of bump. Now it is way too strong right now, so I'm going to turn this strength value down to a 0.08. So that way it's much less strong, but if you look right in here, you can see there is just a little bit of bump all around. And then I want to take this bump and I'll press shift D to duplicate it, and I'm going to drop it right down here, and then the normal can just go through the normal. So now we have this extra height value that we can add data into. So I'm going to take this color from this color amp, this black and white color amp, which is going into the metallic, and I'm going to plug that into the height. And that way it's going to make these little damaged areas look like they're going back in. Now it's not very strong right now, so I'm going to change the strength value up to a 0.2, and now you can really start to see that taking effect. So it looks like those damaged parts are going back in. And you could turn it up more if you like, but I think 0.2 looks pretty good. So that is looking really quite good, and the material is almost finished, but I want to add a little bit of rust. So to add some rust, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for the musgrave texture. I'll drop the musgrave texture right down here, and then I can plug the object up to the vector. And then I can hold down the control and shift key and click on it to preview it. So I want to turn the detail all the way up to 16, so it's very detailed. And then I want to turn this dimension down to a 0.4. And then I want to turn the scale down to a value of 3. So now we have all these cool details in here, and we can use that for our rust. So I want to add the rust in with the color. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a mix RGB, and we're going to drop the mix RGB right down here. So we can now mix the musgrave in with this color right here from the color ramp. So I'm going to take the musgrave and plug that into the factor on the mix. And then I can control shift and click on the mix to preview it. And I want to take this color ramp and put that into color 2. And then I'll just leave this set to mix. So this musgrave texture is the factor to tell it where the rust is going to be. So I can now take color 1, and I can make that the rusty color. So I'm going to click on it, and I'm going to make it a reddish brownish dark color. And for the rust color, I'm going to be using a hex value of 592614. Now there's way too much rust, and that doesn't look very good. So what I want to do is control how much rust there is. So I'm going to press shift A, and again we're going to search for another color ramp, and we're going to use the color ramp to tell it how much rust we want there to be. So I'm actually going to flip these two values. So I'm going to take the black over here and put the white over here. Then I can start to drag this white tab over, and when I drag it closer to the black value, there's going to be less rust. So you can just drag the white tab anywhere between here to have less rust or more rust. And you can also drag the black tab out if you want more rust, but I don't want very much rust. So I'm going to keep the black tab over here, and I'll drag the white tab out a little bit so there's a bit less rust. So now if I control shift and click on the principled, you can see there's some little bits of rust here and there. Now there's just one more thing I want to do to finish up this material. I want to make the rust just slightly bumpy. So I'm going to take this bump down here and I'll press shift D to duplicate, and I'm going to drop it right down here. And then this color ramp has data of where the rust is. So what I can do is I can take this color and I can plug it all the way down here and put it into this extra height value on this bump. And then I'm going to turn the strength of this bump up to like a 0.25. And now if you zoom in here, you can see that the rust is just a little bit bumpy. And that is it. So that is the finished material. And I just gave that a render, and here is the finished result. So this is going to be it for this tutorial. So thank you so much for watching, and I hope you enjoyed the tutorial. And again, you can purchase this procedural material over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page, and that's a great way to help support this channel. So again, thank you for watching, and I hope to see you in a future tutorial."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWoN_or89yE,Procedural Car Paint (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural car paint material in Blender, compatible with both Cycles and Eevee render engines. The presenter walks through the process of setting up the material, including adjusting metallic properties, clear coat, and adding a Voronoi texture for a glittery effect. Additionally, it explains how to create a custom node group with multiple color presets and a custom color option. The tutorial also includes a brief promotion of the presenter's Gumroad store, Patreon page, and Sketchfab, the video sponsor.","In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural car paint material. And this car paint material works really well in both the Cycles and the Eevee render engines. So here it is in the Cycles render engine, and here it is in the Eevee render engine. So I think it looks really good in both Cycles and Eevee. And if you'd like to purchase this procedural material, then you can do that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page, and that's a really great way to help support this YouTube channel. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials. Or if you'd like to learn how to create more of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material playlist on YouTube. And then one more thing before we get started, I wanted to give a huge thanks to Sketchfab for sponsoring this video. On Sketchfab's 3D Model Store, you can purchase models and assets. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can upload and preview your own 3D models in your browser. You can even view your 3D models on a phone or tablet. You can also apply to become a seller on the platform. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. So real quick, I'm just going to show you what I have here in the 3D space. So what I did is I just added an icosphere, and I just subdivided it and then shaded it smooth. And then also I have this BMW car model that I created a little while ago, and I will be putting the car paint on this. Now to get very realistic lighting with some nice reflections, I added in this Machineshop 021K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com, so I'll leave a link in the description if you'd like to download it. And what I really like about this HDRI is that it has all these cool lights right here, and it looks really good for reflections on a car. And then also I wanted to add some more of those reflections, so what I did is I just added in these two planes right here, and I just gave them an emission material, and that way they're going to add some more cooler reflections on the car paint. And then just like all of my procedural material tutorials, I will be using the Node Wrangler add-on, so if you don't have that turned on, you can just click on edit and go to the user preferences, and then right over here under add-ons, you can search for Node, and then just turn on this Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So I'm just going to select this object, and I'm going to click on new, and then I can just call this procedural car paint. So the first thing I'm going to do is drag the metallic value all the way up to one, so it's a metallic material. And then I'm going to change the base color to kind of like a blue color, we'll be changing the colors later on, but for now we'll turn it to a blue color. And then I want to turn this clear coat right here all the way up to one, and that's going to add a shiny clear coat over this material. And then you can change the clear coat roughness, but I think the default at 0.03 looks pretty good. So just by changing those few settings, this already looks like a really cool car paint material, but I want to give it a subtle texture, so that the car paint looks slightly glittery or flaky. So to do this, I'll press shift A, and I'm going to search for the Voronoi texture and drop it down here, and then using the feature from the Node Wrangler, I can press ctrl T with that selected, and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I don't need the mapping, so I'll click on it and press X to delete it, and I want to plug the object up to the vector. Now to use the other Node Wrangler feature, I can hold down the ctrl and shift key and click on different nodes, and that is going to preview the node. So I can ctrl shift and click twice, and that's going to go down to the color value, and you can see that we have this cool texture right here. Now I'm going to turn the scale up to an 800, so that it's very very small. Now this scale value will depend on the size of your object, so you might need to change the scale value so it looks good on your object, but for me 800 works really well. So now what I want to do is I want to take the color and put that into the roughness, and then I can ctrl shift and click on this. So now what I want to do is I want to control that roughness, because if I zoom in here, you can see it's kind of looking cool, but it is a little bit too strong. Some parts of the material are like super shiny, and then some parts aren't very shiny, so I want to control that a little bit better. So I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a color ramp node, and drop it down here. Now if you like how this looks, you could leave it, but I think there's too much contrast between rough and shiny, so I'm going to take the white tab, and I'm going to turn it down a little bit. And then I'm going to take the black tab, and I'm going to turn that up by quite a bit. And for the tab on the left here, if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, then you can click over on the hex value, and you can type in A6 A6 A6. And then over here on the right side, if you'd like to use the same color that I'm using, right over here on the color, you can click on the hex, and you can type in CB CB CB. So the difference between these two colors is very subtle, so the roughness value isn't going to change by very much, but if you kind of give it some more samples, and wait for it to load up, you can really start to see that texture there. And if you switch over to the Eevee render engine, I do think these colors look really nice. But you could make this more contrasty if you wanted to, by clicking on this left tab, and then you can drag this down and make it darker, but I don't really like the look of that, because it looks a bit too contrasty and too shiny. All right, and that is pretty much it for the procedural car paint, but there is one more thing I want to show you. I want to show you how to create a custom node with different colors. So what I'm going to do is press Shift A, and I'm going to search for an RGB. So this is basically just a color value. And then what I can do is I can drag this up here, and I'm going to duplicate this by pressing Shift D, and I'm going to make a few different colors. So what you can do right over here, is you can change it to the color that looks good, and then you can add it to these colors. So I'm first going to take this blue one, and click and drag and drop the color right here. And then I'm going to change this to like an orangey color, just change it to an orangey color that looks good. And then once you've gotten it to the color that you like, you can again click and drag and drop the color right there. And then I'm going to do that a few more times. So I'm going to add a green one, and I think the green car paint looks better if it's a bit darker. So something like that. So I'll drop that right there. And then I also want to do a red one, and I'll make that very bright. So that looks pretty good. I'll drop that there. And then for this last one, I'm just going to make it kind of a gray color, so that it's sort of a silvery paint color. So now what I'm going to do, is I'm just going to box select these colors. And then I'm going to press control G. And control G is going to create a node group. So if I tab back into object mode, you can see now we have this custom node group. But you can see that this doesn't have any outputs. So I'm going to tab into edit mode, and you can see that there's a group output, and a group input. So what I want to do, is I just want to take all of these colors, and I want to plug them all up to this group output. So now if you tab back into object mode, you can see that we have all of these custom colors. And you can just plug these up. And this makes it really quick to change the color of the car paint, because you've already created these really nice color presets that you like. Now I don't really like the names right here, so I want to change the names. So I'm going to press tab, then I'm going to press the N key, and N is going to bring up the side panel right here. So now right here under group, you can see that we have these different outputs. And so if I just double click on this, I can rename it. So I'm just going to rename this to blue, and I'll just continue to do that for all of the colors. And the last one, I'm going to call this one silver. Now I also want to create a custom color right down here, so you can change it to any custom color. So to do this, I'm going to tab into edit mode, and then I'm going to take this group input node, and I'm going to drag it right down here. And then right over here under the outputs, I'm going to click on this plus button to add a new one, and I can rename this to custom. So I can now take this group input, and I'm going to plug that into the custom value. So if I now press tab to go back into the original node setup, you can see that we have this custom one right here, and I can just plug it up, and then I can change this color, and it's going to change the custom color. And then to rename this node out here in the main setup, I'm going to press N, and then right over here under the label, I can just call this paint color. All right, there we go. So now we have these custom colors, so you can change the custom color to any color that you want, or you can just plug up your presets. And there we have it. So there is the procedural car paint material. So I hope this tutorial was helpful, and thank you for watching."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tq-6HReNEk,Procedural Cobblestone Material (Blender Tutorial),"In the tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural cobblestone material in Blender. The material offers adjustable randomness, allowing users to make the cobblestones appear more organic or man-made. The tutorial covers using Voronoi and noise textures, setting up lighting, and employing displacement for a realistic look. It also explains how to mix stone and dirt materials, adding details like moss for enhanced realism. The video promotes the creator's procedural material packs available on Gumroad and Patreon and invites viewers to explore more tutorials on their YouTube playlist.","In this tutorial, we're going to be creating this procedural cobblestone material in Blender. And what's really cool about this material is you can change how random you want the cobblestone to be. So after we create the material, you'll be able to take this Voronoi texture and you can change this random value right here. So if you turn this random value all the way up to one, you can see it looks much more random and organic. But then if you turn the randomness value all the way down, it looks much more straight and more man-made. Now if you'd like to help support me and this channel and purchase the procedural material, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the links in the description. And also, real quick before we start, this video was brought to you by my Blender procedural material packs. So I create material packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. So if you like using procedural materials in your artwork, then definitely check out these procedural material packs. And purchasing the packs is a really great way to help support this YouTube channel. Or if you'd like to learn how to create all of my Blender procedural materials, then you can check out my procedural material tutorial playlist on YouTube. All the links are in the description. Alright, so let me real quick just show you the setup that I have in the 3D space. So I just added an icosphere, and then when you add the icosphere, you can use the add icosphere settings to subdivide it, and then I shaded it smooth. And then I also added in this plane right here, and I also subdivided this as well. And why I subdivided these objects is because I'm going to be using the displacements in the node editor, and then I'm also going to be using the adaptive displacement. Now you totally don't have to use the displacement if you don't want to, but the displacement is going to actually pop the cobblestone out of the object. So it does look pretty cool, and it will make it more realistic, but you don't have to use it if you don't want to. And you can also do this tutorial in Eevee. It is a little bit laggy though in the viewport, and also in the Eevee render engine, you're not able to use the displacements. So I will be using the cycles render engine because it looks a bit more realistic, and you can use the displacements. But you could totally use Eevee if you'd like to. Now for the lighting, I just added in these two objects right here, and then I just added in a mission material, and I set the strength to 40, and I added a slightly blue color. And then also to help me get very realistic lighting, I added in this gamrig 1k HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com. So I'll leave a link in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using to get some very realistic lighting. So I just added the HDRI into the world right here, and then I set the strength up to a 1.5. And then I will also be using the node wrangler add-on in this tutorial, so if you don't have that turned on, you can just click on edit, and then open up the preferences. And then just click over here on the add-ons, and on the search here you can start to type in node, and then just check mark the node wrangler add-on. So the add-on is built into Blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. So I'm just going to select this object, and then I'm going to click on new, and I can just call this cobblestone. And then I'm going to click and drag, and I'm going to drop this material on this object as well. Now let's go over the settings for the displacement. So if you want to use the displacement, you're going to need to set the render engine to cycles, because the displacements in the node editor doesn't work in Eevee, it only works in cycles. And then also if you want to use the adaptive displacement, you'll need to set this to experimental. Now you don't have to use the adaptive displacement, but I will be using the adaptive displacement. And then also if you click right over here on the material properties, and go to your cobblestone material, right down here under settings, the displacement here, I want to change this to displacement and bump, and that way we're telling the material to use the displacement. And then the last thing is if you want to use the adaptive displacement, you can click right over here on the modifier properties, and then you can click on add modifier, and you can add the subdivision surface modifier. And then right here you can just turn on the adaptive subdivision. And what this is going to do is it's going to add more detail closer up where you can see the object, but then farther away it will add less detail. And then I'm going to click on this object as well, and I'm also going to add the subdivision surface, and turn on the adaptive subdivision. And then because this is a subdivision surface modifier, it's smoothing out the edges, so I'm going to change this catmull clark to simple. So I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to start by searching for a voronoi texture, and I'm going to drop it down here. And then just select this voronoi, and you can press ctrl t, that's using the feature from the node wrangler, and it's going to add the mapping and texture coordinate. Now I'm going to plug the object up to the vector, and then we don't need the mapping node, so I'm going to select it and press x to delete it. So using the other feature from the node wrangler, I can ctrl shift and click on nodes, and that will preview the node. Now this f1 here on the voronoi, I'm going to change it to distance to edge. So you can see when I turn this down, it's going to be very uniform and straight, but then when I turn the randomness value up, it's going to be very random. So I'm just going to change this to 0.4 for now, but we could play around with this later if you want to. And then I'm also going to turn this scale here to a 1.5, so it's a bit bigger. So now I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a noise texture, and I'll drop the noise texture right down here. And then I want to plug the object into the vector, and then I can ctrl shift and click on it to preview it. So I'm going to turn the scale to 2, and then I'm going to turn the detail up to 5, so it has more detail. So now we have this noise here, and we also have the voronoi. So I want to mix these two together. So I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a mix RGB, and I'll just drop the mix RGB right here. So I want to plug the voronoi texture into color 2, and then I actually want to plug the noise texture into the factor. So I'm actually going to plug the color value into the factor. And then I don't want it to be set to mix, so I'm going to change this to darken. And then this color 1, I'm going to turn it up a bit so it's much brighter, not fully bright, but pretty bright. Now you can see that it is pretty gray, and it's not very contrasty. So I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a color ramp node, and just drop the color ramp right down here. And then I'm just going to box select these nodes and kind of move them over so I have a bit more space. So I'm now going to click on this tab, and I'm going to drag out, and then I can click on this white tab and drag out as well. And now you can really start to see this better because it's more contrasty. So all these white pieces in here are going to be the cobblestone pieces. All right, so that is it for our mask. So now what I want to do is I want to create a stone material, and then also a dirt material, and then we will combine them together. So I'm going to click on the principled, and just kind of drag it up here. And I'm first going to start by creating a stone material. So I'm going to press shift a, and I'm actually going to search for a frame. And I'm going to add the frame right here, and then I can click on the principled, and just drop it in here. So the frame is just a really great way to organize our nodes. Now when I select the frame, I can press n, and n is going to open up this panel right here. And on the label here, I can just rename this to stone, and then I can press n to close that panel, and you can see now it says stone. So to create the stone material, I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to start by adding a noise texture. And we'll just drop it inside that frame, and then we can kind of pull it over. And then with the noise texture selected, I'm going to press ctrl t, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping, and it added it way down here. So I just need to press g to grab, and I'm just going to drop these both in the frame. And then the mapping, we don't need this, so I'm going to press x to delete it, and I want to plug the object up to the vector so that we can use the object coordinates. And then I can ctrl shift and click on this to preview the noise texture. So I'll turn this detail right here all the way up to 16, so it's very detailed. And then I can plug the factor into the base color on the principled, and then I can just ctrl shift and click on the principled. And then let's also press b for the box select, and I'm just going to drag and box select these nodes, and then I'll press g to grab, and I'm just going to move them over a little bit. So now what I want to do is I want to take this mask here, and I want it to contribute to the color of the stone material. So I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a mix rgb, and I'll drop the mix rgb right here in the stone material. I can now take this color ramp right here, and I'm going to plug the color into color 2, and then I can ctrl shift and click on this to preview it. And then I want to change it from mix to multiply instead. Now this doesn't really look like a stone material yet, because it's just kind of white and black, so I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. Let's just drop the color ramp node right in here, and now we can change the colors to change the color of the stone. So I can just ctrl shift and click on the color ramp, and then we can change the colors. So I'm first going to click on the white tab, and I'm going to drag it over a bit so there's a bit more of that white, and then I'm actually going to change it to a gray color. So I'm going to turn down the brightness quite a bit, and I will just drag it down to something like this, so you can see it's now a much darker gray. And then I'm going to hold down the ctrl key and click right here, and that is going to add a new tab. And then I'm going to make this one a gray color, but it'll be a little bit brighter. And then I'm also going to drag it just slightly over here, so that it's just very slightly brown. So you can see now that just is very very slightly brown, and that looks a lot more like a stone color. And then I can ctrl shift and click on the principal to preview it. Now it's very smooth right now, and stone is usually pretty rough, so I'm going to take the factor right here on the noise texture, and plug that into the bump to give it some bump. And then I need to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a bump node. Let's just click on the bump node, and I'm going to drop it right in here. So I want to plug the factor into the height, and then that is going to convert this to normal data. Now it is very strong right now, you can see it's very very strong. So I'm going to turn the strength down to like a 0.2, so it's less strong, and that is looking much better. Now I am also going to change the roughness down a little bit. I'm going to change it down to a 0.4, and that way it's a bit more shiny, but you could also turn the roughness up if you don't want it to be quite as shiny. But I think the rock does look kind of nice if it's just a little bit shiny, so I'll turn the roughness to 0.4. Now I also want this mask right here to be contributing to the bump. So I'm going to take this bump, and I'll press shift d to duplicate it, and drop it right here. And then I can take this color, and I'm going to plug it up to the height value, and then I want this bump to be going into the normal. So this way we can add two bump maps together. So I can just ctrl shift and click on this, and now you can start to see that bumpiness coming through. But it's not very strong right now, so on this bump right here, I'll turn the strength up to 1, and now that is really starting to look much more like cobblestone. Alright, so that is it for our stone material. So I'm now going to create the dirt material down here, and then we'll plug them both together. So I'll press shift a, and I'm going to search for a principled bsdf, and I can just drop it right down here. And then I want to press shift a, and I also want to search for a frame. This is of course totally optional, you don't have to use it if you don't want to, but I'm going to just put the principled bsdf into the frame. And then I can click on the frame and press n to open up the side panel, and I can just rename this to dirt. So it's just a very nice way to organize your nodes. So I'm now going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for another noise texture. Let's put that into the dirt frame, and just bring it over here. And then again let's click on the noise texture and press ctrl t, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping, and we can add it into the dirt. And then again I don't really need the mapping node, so I'm going to press x to delete it, and I can take the object and plug that into the vector. So I'm going to leave the scale at 5, and then I'll turn the detail all the way up to 16, so it's very detailed. And then I can take the color and put that into the base color of the principled, and I can ctrl shift and click on the principled to preview it. Now it doesn't really look like dirt right now, so I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. And let's just drop the color ramp right in here, and then we can play around with the colors, and that'll change the color of our dirt. So I'm going to click on this block tab right here, and I'm going to change this to a dark brown color. So something like this, kind of a dark brown. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value, and you can type in a hex value of 281910. And then I'm going to click on the white tab right here, and I'm going to make this a brown color, but this one is going to be much lighter. And if you'd like to use the same exact hex value that I'm using, you can again click over on the hex, and you can type in 554436. And then just like our other material, I want to take the factor and plug that into the normal, just to give it a little bit of bump. And then I need to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a bump node, and just plug that in here. And then we want to plug the factor into the height, and that'll convert it to normal data. And then it is pretty strong right now, and that's kind of too strong. So I'm going to turn this strength value to a 0.25, so it's less strong. And then again, I want to click on the bump, and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it, and drop it right over here. And I want to plug this into the bump as well. So I'm going to take this mask here, this color ramp, and I can plug the color into the height, and then I can turn the strength all the way up to 1 again. And then I want to add these both together, so I can take this normal and plug it into the normal. So if I control shift and click on that, you can see here's the bump, and then I can control shift and click on this, and you can see now it's adding both of those bumps together. So I can control shift and click on the principle to preview that dirt material. So this is looking pretty cool, but I want to add a little bit of moss into that dirt material. So to create the moss, I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a color ramp node, and let's drop the color ramp node into the dirt material, and I'm just going to drag it up here. So I can now actually take this noise texture, and I'm going to plug the factor, and plug that into the factor of the color ramp. And then I can control shift and click on this color ramp to preview it. So I'm going to drag the black tab out quite a bit, and then I will also drag the white tab out just like that. So I just want the moss to be in a few little places just like that. So now we can just mix this together with the color. So I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a mix rgb again, and we'll just drop this right here. So I can now take this color, and I'm going to plug that into the factor, and then I want this color ramp here from the dirt, and I want that to go into color one. So I can now control shift and click on it to preview it. So color two, that is going to be the color of the moss. So I'm going to change it to kind of a brownish greenish color, and the exact color that I'm going to be using for this moss is a hex value of 476211. So just kind of a desaturated brownish dark greenish color. And then there's just one more thing that I want to do. I want the moss to be kind of bumping out a little bit. So I'm going to take this bump node, and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it, and I'll just drop it right down here in front of the other bumps. So the normal can just go through the normal. So now we have this extra height value to add data into. So I can take this color ramp right here, and I can take the color, and plug that into the height value. And then if I control shift and click on this, I want to turn the strength all the way up to one. So I can now control shift and click on the principled, and we can check that out. So you can see now there's little bits of moss, and by adding this bump here, it's making the moss look like it's bumping out. All right, so now we have our stone, and we also have our dirt. So I want to just mix them together. So I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for a mix shader. Let's just drop the mix shader right here. And then I can just take this principled, and put that up to the shader. And then this one can go to the other shader. So this factor right here is just going to blend between the dirt and the stone. But I want to tell it where I want to be stone, and where I want it to be dirt. So we're going to take this color right here. We're going to take this mask that we created, and I'm going to plug it all the way over here, and plug that into the factor of the mix shader. Now you can see that right now it's kind of doing the opposite of what we want. It's making the parts that are bumping out the dirt. So to fix this, I'm just going to plug the stone material down onto the bottom shader, and then this dirt material is going to go to the top one. And now that looks correct. So the stone is the gray, and then in between it there's dirt. All right so that is looking really cool, but we still haven't used the displacement. So to use the displacement, I'm going to press shift a, and I'm going to search for the displacement node. And I'm just going to drop it down here, and then I can plug the displacement up to the displacement right here. So I can now take this color from the color ramp, and I can plug it up to the height value on the displacement. And then I want to turn the mid level to zero, because we don't want any of that. And then I'm going to turn the scale way down to a 0.1, so it's much less strong. And there we go. So now if I look around here, you can see that the cobblestone is actually popping out of the mesh. Now if you don't want to use the displacement, you don't have to. You can see that if I unplug this, it does actually look pretty cool, but I do like using the displacement. It just makes it a bit more realistic, and I do really like those cobblestone pieces popping out. And then right back over here, as I talked about at the beginning of the tutorial, you can play around with this random value, and it's going to change how straight the cobblestone is. So if you want the cobblestone to look like it's more straight, then you can turn the randomness down. Or if you want it to look much more organic and random, you can turn this randomness value up. And then also you can play around with this color ramp right here. So if you drag the white tab out right over here, you can see that now you're able to see more of the stone. Or if you kind of drag this back and drag the black tab out, you're able to see less of that stone material. And there is the finished rendered material. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and I hope it was helpful, and thank you so much for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzXOQ8UWCBo,Procedural Tie Dye/Paint Splatter (Blender Tutorial),"This Blender tutorial guides viewers through creating three variations of procedural tie-dye paint splatter materials. The tutorial covers using Blender's shader nodes editor to manipulate texture, noise, brightness, contrast, and other elements to achieve different effects. The video also highlights the use of add-ons like Node Wrangler and suggests ways to customize the materials further with hue, saturation, and other settings. Additionally, the tutorial is sponsored by Sketchfab and offers links to purchase tutorial files and procedural material packs on Gumroad and Patreon.","In this Blender tutorial, we will be creating these procedural tie-dye paint splatter materials. And I'm going to show you how to create three different variations of these materials. Now if you'd like to help support me and this YouTube channel and purchase the tutorial files, then you can get those on my Gumroad and my Patreon, links are in the description. And you can also check out my Blender procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials. Or if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material tutorial playlist, all the links are in the description. And then real quick before we start, I wanted to thank Sketchfab for sponsoring this video. Upload and preview your own 3D models on Sketchfab. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can preview 3D models online in your browser. You can also purchase models and assets from Sketchfab's model store. You can use the model inspector to preview the wireframe, matte cap, textures, and more before you purchase. You can also apply to sell your own 3D models. Check out Sketchfab with the link below. Now real quick, let me just show you what I have in the 3D space. So I just added three spheres and I shaded them smooth. And then also I added this plane right here and I gave it a subsurf modifier so that it is round. And then I just added an emission material on it so that we have a nice bright light shining on our spheres. And then also right over here on the world, I added in this Machineshop 021K HDR. This is from polyhaven.com, so it's a free HDRI. And if you'd like to download it, I'll have the link in the description. So I just added this into the world to help us get some nice realistic lighting. And then also if you don't have the Node Wrangler add-on enabled, just click right up here on edit and then go to the preferences. And then just click on the add-ons tab and you can start to type in node over here on the search and you can just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on. I'll show you how to use it in the video. So right here in Blender's shader nodes editor, I'm just going to click on new to add a new material and I can just call this tie dye one. So to create this first variation, I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's just drop the noise texture right down here. And then also with this selected, I can press control T that's using the Node Wrangler feature and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I'm just going to take the object and plug that into the vector on the noise texture. And so we don't need the mapping, so I can just press X to delete it. And then also using the other Node Wrangler feature, I can hold down the control and shift key and click on nodes to preview them. So I'm going to turn the detail right here all the way up to 16 and then I'll turn the roughness here to a 0.6. Now if I control shift and click on this noise texture a couple of times, you can see that as well as it having factor data, it also has color data. And so the factor data is basically a black and white version of this color data. So I can actually take the color and put that into the base color and then I can control shift and click on the principled. Now you can see that it's not very bright right now. It's kind of hard to see the colors. So to make it more bright, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a bright contrast node. So it's a brightness and contrast node and I'll drop it right in here between the noise texture and the principled. So I can now turn the bright value up to a 0.26. I think that looks pretty good. And then I'll also turn the contrast value up to a 8.9. And you can see now because we've turned up that contrast, it's really making it more contrasty. So you're clearly able to see those colors. Now it really depends on what you're using this for, but I think it would be cool just to add a little bit of bump. So I'm going to take the color and I'm going to put that color into the normal and then I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for a bump node so that we can convert this to bump data or normal data. So I'll plug the bump node right in here. So the color needs to go into the height on the bump and then that can go into the normal. Now it does look pretty strong right now. And if you like this, you could leave it how it is, but I'm going to turn the strength way down to a 0.1. So it's not very rough. If you zoom in, you can just see a little bit of roughness. And then I'm going to turn the roughness down to like a 0.3 and you can see now it looks just a little bit shiny and there we go. So that is the first variation. So this could be used on like a tie dye shirt, or if you wanted to make some sort of abstract painting, maybe a painting on the wall or something like that, then you could put this material on some paint canvas or maybe on like a piece of paper or something like that. So let's now move over to our second sphere and we're going to create the second variation, which is going to have more swirls. So I'm going to click on this sphere right here and I'm going to click on the dropdown and I'm going to add the tie dye one material. Now I want to duplicate it so it's a separate material. So I'll click on this button right here and that will make it a separate material, but keep the same data. So I can now rename it to tie dye two. Now for this one, I'm going to change the scale to two so that it's a bit smaller. And then I'll also turn the distortion up to one. So that distortion value is adding a lot more swirls in the texture and you could turn it up even more if you want to, but I do think that looks a little bit weird. So I just like to turn it to one. And then of course you can change the scale if you want to be smaller and more detailed. And also you can turn up the roughness value if you want there to be a lot more roughness. So you can see when I turn that up, it looks a lot more detailed. Or if I turn the roughness down, you can see now there's not quite as much detail on the edges there. I like a value of 0.6. All right, that is the second one. So let's jump over to our third sphere. I'm going to click on the third sphere. And then right here, I'm going to click on the drop down and I'm going to add the tie dye one again. And then again, I want to duplicate this material. So I'm going to click on this button right here to duplicate the material. And I can just rename this material to tie dye three. Now for this material, I'll change the scale to four just so that it's a little bit bigger. And then I'm going to change the brightness value. So I'm going to make this brightness value a negative 0.5. And when I do that, you can see that now all the white values are now dark. And then I want to add a little bit more roughness. So I'll turn this roughness value to 0.7. And if you zoom in here, you now you can see there's a bunch more detail in there. All right, so the materials are finished. Now one other way that you can customize these materials, if you want to change the colors of them, is you can press shift a and you can search for a hue saturation node. And I'm just going to drop the hue saturation node after the bright contrast. So now if you change the hue, it's going to change the colors. So you can see if I turn the hue all the way up to one, now it's just using like a light blue, a pink and a yellow, or I can just keep on changing the hue. And that does look really cool. I think that looks pretty cool. Or I could even turn it to a negative value like a negative one. Let's try a negative five. That looks pretty cool as well. And of course you can change the brightness value and the contrast value, and that's going to make it look different as well. So you can see really with just these two nodes, you can really change the look of your paint splatter or your tie dye material. I'll just add a hue saturation value to the second one as well. And let's play around with this. So I'll change the hue. You can see it totally looks different. I could also play around with the saturation if I want it to be a lot more stronger, or if I want the colors to be more faded, I could turn the saturation down. And then the value is going to control the brightness. So if I wanted to turn the brightness down on this, I could turn the value down. So I'll give this a render now and we can take a look at the final materials. And there we have it. So there are the finished materials. So if you're wanting to create some sort of tie dye or abstract paint splatter material, then these materials are really quick and easy to make and they have a great result. So thank you for watching this tutorial and I hope the tutorial was helpful. And a great way to help support this channel is by purchasing the tutorial files on my Gumroad and Patreon.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHaFHPz46kM,Procedural Cardboard Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural cardboard material. They discuss various techniques, including using a wave texture and noise texture, adjusting color ramps, and setting up lighting for a realistic effect. The tutorial provides a detailed explanation of creating subtle stripes and roughness to mimic the look of cardboard, as well as addressing UV mapping issues to ensure the texture aligns correctly on a 3D model. Additionally, the creator promotes their Gumroad store, Patreon, and procedural material packs for further support, and thanks Sketchfab for sponsoring the video.","In this Blender tutorial, we will be creating this procedural cardboard material. Now if you'd like to help support me and this channel and purchase the project files, then you can get that over on my Gumroads store, link will be in the description, and also my patrons on my Patreon page will be getting the project files as well. And also if you'd like to purchase more of my procedural materials, then you can check out my Blender procedural material packs, links will be in the description. Or if you'd like to learn how to create all of my procedural materials yourself, you can check out my procedural material playlist on YouTube. And then one last thing before we get started, I wanted to thank Sketchfab for sponsoring this video. Sketchfab is a 3D model site where you can buy, sell, and even upload your own 3D models and preview them in your browser. Throughout the month of November 2021, Sketchfab is holding a 3D challenge. And the theme of the challenge is a collision between nature and civilization. They've also got some insane prizes for the challenge winners. If you'd like to learn more about the challenge, you can find the link in the video description. All right, so real quick before we start, let me just show you the setup that I have in 3D. So I just pressed shift A and I just added an icosphere, and then right behind me on the add icosphere settings, I turned up the subdivisions so that it's a nice smooth sphere. And then I also shaded the object smooth. And then I also 3D modeled this cardboard box because a cardboard material would look pretty good on a cardboard box. So I just made this basic cardboard 3D model. And then also for the lighting, I added this plane right here and I pointed the plane at the objects. And then I gave it an emission material. And that way there's a nice bright light shining on our objects. And then also to get very realistic lighting over here on the world settings, I added in this artist workshop 1K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com. So I'll leave the link in the description if you'd like to use the same HDRI that I'm using. And then also I will be using the node wrangler add on in this tutorial. So if you don't have that turned on, you can just click on edit and then open up the preferences. And then over there on the add ons tab, you can type in node here on the search and just turn on the node wrangler add on. All right, so let's create this cardboard material. And then at the end of the tutorial, I'll show you how I place the cardboard material on a cardboard 3D model. So I'm just going to click on new here and I can just call this procedural cardboard. And then right up here, I'm going to click and drag, and I'm going to drop this cardboard material on the sphere as well. Of course, you can add this onto whatever object you like. So if you've ever looked up close at cardboard or felt the surface of cardboard, cardboard has some little stripes that go up and down, kind of like some little waves. And they are pretty subtle, but you can definitely feel them and usually see them if the light is shining kind of on the side of the cardboard. So to make this, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a wave texture and I'll just drop the wave texture right here. And then using the feature from the node wrangler with the wave texture selected, I can press control T and that will add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then we don't need the mapping for now, so I'm going to click on it and press X to delete it. And then I want to plug the object up to the vector on the wave texture. And then using the other feature from the node wrangler, if you hold down the control and shift key and click on different nodes, that will preview the node. It'll add the viewer node and then you can preview the different nodes. So I'm going to turn the scale up to a seven and that way these little lines here are a bit smaller. And then also I'm going to turn the distortion up to one and you can see now there's just a tiny little bit of distortion and it just makes it a little bit more organic. And then I'll turn the detail all the way up to the max, which is 16, so there's just a little bit more detail in those stripes. And then I'll turn the detail scale to two. And now you can really start to see there's a little bit of detail there on the side of the stripes. And then I'll also turn the detail roughness all the way up to one, so there's even more detail. So now let's take this color and we're going to plug it into the base color and then we can control shift and click on the principled BSDF. Now this doesn't look like cardboard, so we need to add a color ramp in here to change the colors. So I'll press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. Let's just drop the color ramp node right here and now we can change the colors in between to make the cardboard. So I'm going to click on the minus here to get rid of one of these tabs and then I'll click on the white tab and I'm going to make this a cardboard material, so kind of like a light brown. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm going to be using, you can click over on the hex value and you can type in a hex value of C9985D. So that's the color that I'm going to be using. I think it does look really nice for a cardboard box. Now if we control shift and click on this color ramp, you can see that because there's just one color, now we're not able to see the waves in the wave texture. So what I'm going to do is click on the plus here to add a new tab and I'll just drag this tab all the way over here. And then I want it to be just a tiny bit darker and that way you'll be able to see the stripes, but they're going to be very, very subtle. So I will click on the color of the new tab that we've created and I'll hover my mouse over the color and then I'm going to scroll just one click with my mouse wheel. So I'll just scroll one click down and just make it a tiny bit darker. So these two colors are very similar, but this color right here is just slightly darker than this one. So if you zoom in here, you can just see those subtle stripes and that does start to look like cardboard. So now I also want this to be contributing to the roughness just a little bit. So I'll take the color here and put that into the roughness value. And then I want to be able to control that roughness. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for another color ramp and let's just drop the color ramp right in here. And then I can control shift and click back on the principled BSDF. So now you can see that it's definitely more shiny. Cardboard is pretty rough, but it is a little bit reflective. So on the black tab here, I'm going to click on this and I'm going to just start to turn up that color. So if you turn it all the way up to white, you can see now the cardboard is very rough, but then if you turn it down, it'll be more shiny. So I'm just going to make it kind of a gray color, something like that, so that it's a little bit shiny. So that is definitely starting to look like cardboard, but I do just want to add a little bit of noise just to make it look a little bit more organic and give it a little bit of a texture. Because if you looked at cardboard close up, usually cardboard does have just a little bit of noise and it's a little bit random. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to add a noise texture. Let's just drop the noise texture right down here. And then I want to plug the object up to the vector and then we can control shift and click on the noise texture. So I'm going to turn the scale to 15 and then I'll turn the detail to the max, which is 16. So now I want to add this noise texture into the color. So it's contributing to the color, because if I control shift and click on this color ramp, you can see these stripes are pretty straight. They aren't really random at all. And I just want a little bit more randomness. So I want some little blotchy areas here and there where you can't really see the stripes as well. So to mix this together, I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a mix RGB and I'll drop the mix RGB right here in between the wave texture and the color ramp. And then I want to plug the wave texture into the factor and then I want to plug the noise texture factor into color one. And then I want to change it from mix to add instead. So here it is, just change it to add. So if I control shift and click on the wave texture, you can see here's the wave texture and I can control shift and click on the noise texture. But then if I control shift and click on the ad, you can now see what it's doing. So it's still using the wave texture. But what it's done is it's made the wave texture much more subtle, and then it's added the noise texture in here. So basically, it's giving it little bits of noise into the wave texture, you can see there's just little bits of noise in the wave texture. So I can now control shift and click on the principal shader. And you can see that it is affecting the color a little bit. Now cardboard isn't super, super smooth, it is a little bit rough, just kind of a small roughness over the surface. So I want to plug some values into the normal. So I'm first going to take the ad here, and I'm going to plug that color into the normal. And then I do need to convert this to normal data. So I'll press shift a and I'm going to add a bump node. And let's just drop the bump node right here. And then I want the color from the ad to be going into the height, the value, just like this color into the height value, and then the normal can go into the normal. So now what it's doing is taking those stripes, and it's making it look like they're bumping out. Now, obviously, this is way too strong. So on the strength value, I'm going to turn this way down to a point zero five. So now if you zoom in, you can see it's very subtle, but kind of right up here, you can see it is bumping out just a little. And then just to give it a little bit more noise all over the place, I'm going to take this bump, and I'll press shift D to duplicate it. And I'll just drop it right down here. So I want the normal to be going into the normal. So we now have this extra height input that we can put values into. So I'm going to take the factor from this noise texture, and I'm going to plug it into the height, just like that. So now if you zoom in here, especially in the reflections, you can see there's just a tiny bit of noise right in there. And it just makes it look a little bit more realistic, although I would like it to be a little bit stronger. So I'll turn the strength value to a point zero six on this one instead, just so that that noise there is a little bit stronger. And that is it. That is the finished procedural cardboard material. Now there is one problem. It does look kind of okay on the sphere, but on this box here, if I just go down into the material preview, or if you're in Blender Eevee, then it will be in real time. If you take a look at the stripes, you can see that some of the stripes are messed up here. So you can see that right here on this, there actually aren't any stripes. And then like right over here, you can see the stripes are going sideways, and I don't really want that. I want them to be going up and down. So to fix this, what I'm going to do is right up here, I'm going to click on the cardboard object, and then I'm going to click right here to duplicate the material, but keep the same data. So I'm going to click on this, and now it says procedural cardboard zero zero one, and I can just rename this to procedural cardboard two. So now we have two separate materials. We have the procedural cardboard and the procedural cardboard two. So I can now change this material, and it won't affect the other material. So instead of using the object coordinates, I actually want to use the UV coordinates, and then we can just UV unwrap the cardboard material. So I'm going to change this to UV. So I'll change it to UV. So just plug the UV into both of the vectors. So now let's just make sure this cardboard 3D model is selected, and I'm going to hop over to the UV editing tab. And then I'm just going to double tap the A key to select everything. And I'm going to press U, and I'm going to click on the smart UV project, and then just click on OK. So for objects like this, which are very cubic and have sharp edges, the smart UV project works really well. So now here's the UV mapping, and I'm going to go into the material preview just so that I can see that. So I now need to press A to select everything over here on the UV mapping, and I need to press S to scale. And I'm just going to scale this way up, and just scale it to whatever you want. Tab back into edit mode, and just scale this to whatever you want. Something like that looks pretty good. All right, but now I want this to be rotated over because you can see that the stripes are going this way, and I don't want that. But if you look inside here, you can see the stripes inside are going up and down, and I do want the stripes to be going up and down inside the box. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to press 3, or click right up here onto the face select. I now want to deselect all of these, so I'm just going to hold down the shift key and click, and I'm just going to deselect these right here. So now right over here on the UV editing, I can just press R to rotate, and I can type in 9 0 and enter to rotate it over by 90 degrees. So now if I tab back into object mode, and just look at this object, you can see now they're all going straight up and down, although there is a problem. This face right here is going sideways, and I don't want that, so I'll just press R to rotate, and then type in 9 0 and enter, just like that. So now you can see that they're all going up and down, and there we have it. So that is the procedural cardboard material. So I hope this tutorial was helpful, and I hope you enjoyed it, and thank you so much for watching.

And the theme of the challenge is a collision between nature and civilization. They've also got some insane prizes for the challenge winners. If you'd like to learn more about the challenge, you can find the link in the video description. All right, now before we get started, I just wanted to show you the setup that I have in Blender. So right here in the 3D view, I just pressed Shift-A, and I just went right down here to an icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click on those add icosphere settings, I turn these subdivisions up to five, and that way it's pretty subdivided. And then I also shaded this object smooth, so it's just a nice smooth sphere. Then I also pressed Shift-A, and I just added in some planes here. And this plane, I just scaled way up. And then this plane, I added a subsurf modifier on it so that it's circular. And then I just gave both of these an emission material, and that way they give some nice bright lighting on our procedural mud. And then also to help me get very realistic lighting right over here on the world, I added in this Abandoned Hopper Terminal 01 1K HDR. And this is from polyhaven.com, so the link will be in the description if you'd like to use the same HDRI that I'm using just to get some very realistic lighting. Now in this tutorial, I am going to be using the displacement in the Node Editor. So if you'd like to do this, then you will need to be using the Cycles render engine. Now if you do want to do this tutorial in Eevee, then you certainly can, but you won't be able to use the displacements in the Node Editor because in Eevee, that isn't supported. It won't actually displace the mesh. I will be doing this in Cycles though, so I'm just going to switch this over to Cycles. And let me just show you how to set up the displacement. So first of all, of course, you need to be in the Cycles render engine. And then also, I'm going to be using the Adaptive Subdivision. So to use the Adaptive Subdivision, you need to make sure this is set to Experimental on the Feature Set. And then what you need to do is just add a new material. So I'm just going to delete this and we'll add a new material. And I can just call this Procedural Mud. All right, so now that we've created the Procedural Mud material, I'm going to go right down here to the Material Properties. I'm going to scroll down and then right down here under Settings, under the Surface, the Displacement is set to Bump Only. We want to set it to Displacement and Bump, and that way it'll actually use the displacement. And then also, I do want to use the Adaptive Subdivision. So right over here on the Modifier Properties, just click on this object. What you can do is just click on Add Modifier, and you can add the Subdivision Surface Modifier. And then right here, you need to click on the Adaptive Subdivision. And this way, it's going to add more detail where you can see the object, but then when the object is farther away, it'll add less detail. And then just one last thing before we start, I will be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you don't have that enabled, just click on Edit, and then open up the Preferences. And then in the User Preferences, you can just click over on the add-ons. And up here in the search, you can start to type in Node, and then just checkmark this Node Wrangler add-on, and I'll show you how to use the add-on in the tutorial. All right, so to get started, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And I'll just drop the noise texture right down here. And then using the feature from the Node Wrangler, I can select the noise texture, and I can press Ctrl-T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now, I don't want the mapping, so I'll just select it and press X to delete it. And then I want to take the object and plug that into the vector of the noise texture. And also using the other feature from the Node Wrangler, I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and then click on Nodes, and that will preview the different nodes. So I'm going to Ctrl-Shift and click on the noise texture. Now, I'm going to turn the scale up to 13. And then I'll turn the detail all the way up to 16, so it has a lot more detail. And then I do want a little bit of roughness, so I'll turn the roughness up to 0.6. So I can now take the factor and plug the factor up to the base color. And then let's Ctrl-Shift and click on the principled BSDF. So that doesn't really look like mud right now, so I want to press Shift-A, and I want to search for a ColorRamp node. And let's drop the ColorRamp node right in here, and then we can change the different colors in between to make it look like mud. So I will click on the white tab, and I'm going to make this a brown color, a muddy color, something like that. But I do want it to be a bit darker, not super bright. And if you'd like to use the exact same color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value, and you can type in 504035. And then let's click on the black tab. And this one, I'm also going to have a brown color, but it's going to be even darker. And again, to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex, and you can type in 36291C. All right, so it's looking a little bit more like mud, but what I want to do is take this factor here on the noise texture and plug that into the roughness so I can play around with the amount of roughness. And then I want to press Shift-A, and I want to search for another ColorRamp. And I'll just drop the ColorRamp right in here, and that way we can change the colors, and it'll make it more shiny or more rough. And then I just want to click on the white tab, and I want to make this a bit more of a darker color. And as I turn this brightness value down, you can see the mud is now looking more wet and more shiny. So I don't want it to be super shiny, not like a mirror that's too shiny, but just a little bit darker. Something like that is pretty good, so I like how that is. And then I also want to take this factor here from the noise texture, and I want to plug it into the normal to give it some bump. Now we need to convert this to normal data because this is factor, so this is just black and white data, and then this is normal data. So to convert it to normal data, I need to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a bump node. Let's just drop the bump node right in here. So I want the factor to be going into the height on the bump, and then I want the bump to be going into the normal. Now I am going to be using the displacements to kind of displace the mesh and make it all bumpy, so I actually don't need a very high strength value. So on the strength here on the bump, I'm just going to change it to like a 0.1, so it's not very strong. All right, and that is it for the dirt part of the material. So now I also want to create the muddy puddles. So to create the muddy puddles material, I'm going to click on this Principled BSDF, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it and just drop it right up here. And then I'm also going to take this noise texture and press Shift-D to duplicate it and also drop this up here. And then I'll drag the texture coordinate up, and I want to plug the object into the vector of this as well. So on this top noise texture right here, I'm going to turn the roughness up to a 0.7, and then I'm also going to turn the distortion up to a value of 1. So if I now Control-Shift and click on it, you can see that there's all those little swirls in there, and that will help to make it look more like watery mud. So let's now take the factor, and I'm going to plug the factor into the base color, and then I can Control-Shift and click on this to preview it. Now again, I need to change the colors because right now this is just black and white. So I'm going to take this color ramp down here, and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it, and I'm just going to drop it right up here. And then I do want the mud puddles to be a bit of a lighter brown, so on this tab right here, I'm just going to make it a bit brighter. And if you want to use the same color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex, and you can type in 7F6955. And then also water is very reflective, so right over here on the roughness value, I'm going to turn this way down to a 0.05, and that way it is very shiny and reflective. Now I also want to take the factor on the noise texture, and I want to put that into the normal, and then we need to convert this again to normal data. So I'll press Shift-A, and I'm going to add another bump node, and let's just drop the bump node right here. And then again, we need to take the factor and put that into the height value on the bump. So now this is way too strong, so I want to make it much less strong. So I'm going to turn the strength right here down to a 0.03, and that'll just give the mud puddles a little bit of bump. And that is it for the muddy puddles. So now we just need to blend them both together, and then we can also do the displacements. So to blend these two materials together, I'll press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a mix shader. Let's just drop the mix shader right here. So I want to take the principle of the top one and put that into the top shader, and then this one down here, I want to put that into the bottom shader. So now we're just evenly blending between them. So I want to create a mask to just tell it where it's going to be the mud puddles and where it's going to be the dirt. So to do this, I'm going to click on this noise texture, and I'll press Shift-A to duplicate it and kind of drop it in the middle. And then I can take the object and plug that into the vector. And then let's Control-Shift and click on it to preview it. So I want to turn the scale to three, and then the roughness, I'll turn this back to a 0.5. Now I'll press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp node, and I'll drop the color ramp node right down here. And so what I want to do is I want to drag these both together, and this way it's going to be more contrasty. So we're basically creating a mask to tell it where the puddles are going to be. So I'm just going to drag these two tabs together, something like that. So I can now take the color, and I can put that into the factor on the mix shader. And I can now Control-Shift and click on the mix shader to preview it. And I think I actually want there to be a little bit less puddles, so I will drag these tabs over just a little bit. So there's a little bit less of those puddles. All right, so that is looking really good. So we just need to do the displacements now. So to do the displacement, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for the displacement node, and I'll just drop the displacement node right down here on the very bottom. And then I need to take the displacement and put that into the displacement on the material output. So now let's take this first noise texture from the dirt, and I'm going to take the factor and plug that into the height on the displacement. So it's going into the height, but we need to take the mid-level and we need to turn that to zero. And then it's also way too strong right now, so I'm going to turn the scale way down to a 0.04, so it's much less strong. So that is looking pretty good. You can see it's kind of bumping out all around, but I don't want the mud puddles to be bumping out. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a MixRGB. And let's just drop the MixRGB right here before the displacement. And then I want to make sure the noise texture is going into color 1. So now what we want to do is we want to mask out where the puddles are. So we already have a mask for our puddles, and that is this color ramp right up here. So I can take the color, and I can drag this all the way down and put it into the factor down here on the mix. And then color 2, I want to make that fully black. All right, so it's definitely doing something, but you can see that where the puddles are, that's actually bumping out, and where the dirt is, that's not bumping out. It's kind of smooth. So I actually need to invert this. So I'm just going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a invert node because we need to invert the white values and the black values. So right here where the factor is, I'm just going to drop the invert right here. And now you can see that where the puddles are, like right up here, it's kind of smooth, but then where the more dirt mud is, it's bumping out. And that is it. That is the procedural mud material.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYyUMMboZFk,Realistic Glass Shader in Blender Eevee (Tutorial),"This Blender tutorial demonstrates how to create a realistic glass shader using Blender Eevee. The tutorial walks through setting up the shader, adjusting transmission and roughness, enabling screen space refraction and reflections, and using a mix shader with a Fresnel node to achieve realistic transparency. It also covers using a solidify modifier to add thickness and adjusting sample counts to reduce graininess. The video concludes by suggesting ways to support the creator through Gumroad and Patreon, where the Blender file is available for download.","In this Blender tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this realistic glass shader in Blender Eevee. Now if you'd like to download this Blender file with the Eevee glass shader, then I'll have a free download on my Gumroad and Patreon where you can download this Blender file with the glass shader. But if you'd like to help support me, you can throw a dollar into the tip box before you purchase and that will help to support me. And purchasing products on my Gumroad store is also a really great way to help support the channel, so I'll have links in the video description. Alright, so with that all out of the way, let's get started with the tutorial. So I have the 3D view on this side of the screen and then I also have the shader editor on this side of the screen. So the first thing that I'm going to do obviously is change the render engine to Eevee. I'm now going to select this object and I'm going to click on new here to add a new material and I can just call this glass shader. And then what I can do is I can click and drag and just drop the glass shader onto these other objects. So you can just apply the shader to whatever object you want. Now to make it look like glass, I'm going to turn this transmission value all the way up to one and then unless you're making some sort of frosted glass, I'm going to turn the roughness all the way down to zero. So this is starting to look like glass, but the problem with it is that you can't see through the glass. So what we need to do is we need to click right over here on the material properties and I'm going to scroll down. So right down here under settings, we need to turn on this screen space refraction. And then also let's scroll right up here and I'm going to go over to the render properties and we want to turn on screen space reflections. And then if you open up the screen space reflections, I want to turn on this refraction and now it's already looking a lot more realistic. So you can see through it and that does look much more realistic. Now we still have a problem and that is if you look through glass, you're not able to see glass through glass. So to fix this, I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a transparent BSDF. Now what I want to do is I want to mix these two together so that some of the object is transparent so that we can see through it, but then some of it is this glass. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a mix shader. I'll just drop it right down here. And then I want to plug the transparent up to the top one and the principled onto the bottom one. Now the transparency doesn't really seem to be working. If I plug this up to the surface, you can see it's not working at all. It's fully black. And that is because we need to tell blender to use the transparency. So to do that again, over here on the side panel, I'm going to go to the material properties and right down here under settings, I'm going to turn the blend mode and shadow mode from opaque to alpha hashed. And now it's actually using that transparency. So if I plug the transparent in there, you can see it is using the transparency. You can't see the glass at all. So I can now plug the mix shader up and you can see it's using the transparency. Now, right now it's just evenly mixing them together. So I can change the factor here and it's going to be only transparent or only glass. And I don't want this because this is just kind of evenly blending between them. I want to tell it where it's going to be more transparent and where it's going to be more glass. So to do this, I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for the Fresnel. I'm going to drop the Fresnel right down here. And then I want to take the factor and plug that into the factor on the mix shader. So what the Fresnel does is it makes the faces darker when you're looking straight at it, but then kind of on the sides, when you're looking sideways on a face, it makes it more white. And you can see now what it's doing is it's using the principled glass here on the edges, but then it's using the transparency in the middle. Now I want to be able to control this a little bit better. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp node and I'll just drop the color ramp node right here. So I can now take this block color and I can start to turn it up. So really you can just change this to your liking. If you want it to be a little bit more transparent, you can turn it down, or if you want it to be a little less transparent, you can turn it up. I personally like this color right here. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value and you can type in a7a7a7. Now also over here on this monkey head, what I did is I added in this solidify modifier, because you can see without the solidify modifier, it doesn't really look that realistic. It kind of just looks like it's a super, super thin piece of glass. It almost looks like if you set this down, just the smallest amount of pressure would break the glass. So to make it look a bit more realistic, I added this solidify modifier and just turned it up to make it a little bit thick. And that looks a lot more realistic because it gives that glass a little bit of thickness. So this does look pretty cool and it does look pretty realistic. You can see through it and it has reflections and shadows, but there is a problem with this. And that problem is that it's really quite grainy. So there are a few things that you can do to fix this. So one thing that we can do to get rid of that grain is we can turn up the sample count in Eevee. So right over here on the render properties, Eevee does actually have samples. So if you turn the viewport and render both up to something really high, like a thousand. Now, if you zoom in here, you can see the grain is much less. Now this does look a lot nicer, but it will take longer to render. So if I just render this, it took my computer 14 seconds to render this image. And so that's not really desirable. We would like it to render faster. So you could turn up the sample count, but what you could also do is just turn the sample count up a little bit. So maybe not turn it up to a thousand, maybe just turn it up to something like a hundred, and then you can render this again. So that rendered much quicker. It only rendered in three seconds. And you can see that does look pretty nice. There is still a little bit of grain, but it does look better. So what you can do to get rid of that last little bit of grain is you can go over to Blender's compositor. So when you hop over to Blender's compositor, you can just click on the use nodes button right up there. And then you can press shift day and you can search for a denoise node and then just plug the image into the image on the denoise. And then you can plug the image up to the composite. So you can see here's the glass shader without the denoise. It does just look a little bit grainy, but then with the denoise, you can see it smooths that all out and it does look quite a bit nicer. And then also, if you'd like to change the color of the glass right here on the principle, you can just change this base color to whatever you want. And that is going to change the color of the glass. All right. And that is going to wrap it up for this tutorial. So that is how you create a realistic glass shader in Blender Eevee. And if you'd like to help support me and this channel, then definitely consider checking out my Gumroad and Patreon. So thank you for watching. I hope this was helpful and I hope to see you in a future video."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCeHg7yHMw,Procedural Rusty Painted Metal (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural rusty painted metal material using Blender's procedural nodes. The video covers steps such as setting up an icosphere, applying smooth shading, and using a noise texture with a color ramp to create the rust and paint effects. The tutorial also explains how to adjust the material's roughness, metallic properties, and bumpiness to achieve realistic results. Additionally, viewers can change the paint color without affecting the material's texture by duplicating the color ramp. The creator offers the material for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon and promotes their procedural material packs.","In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural rusty painted metal material in Blender. Now if you'd like to help support me and this YouTube channel and purchase the procedural material, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon. I'll have the links in the description. And also before we start, this video was brought to you by my procedural material packs. So if you like using procedural nodes in your artwork, then definitely check out these procedural material packs. So I create packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. And purchasing those material packs is also a really great way to help support me and this YouTube channel. And also if you'd like to learn how to create all of these procedural materials yourself, then I have a playlist on my YouTube channel where I show you how to create all of the different procedural materials. Links will be in the description. So here's the procedural material that we're going to be creating, and then also at the end of the video, I will show you how to change the color of the paint. Although I do think yellow paint definitely looks the best. So what I did over here in the 3D view is I just pressed shift A and I just added an icosphere, or you could also add a regular sphere. And then when I added the icosphere right behind me, if you click on the add icosphere settings, I turned these subdivisions up to six. So it's very subdivided. And then I also shaded this object smooth. And then I also added in a Suzanne head and I added a subsurf modifier on it. And then I also shaded that smooth as well, just so that we have a really interesting object with lots of cool shapes to preview the material. And then also to help get very realistic lighting right over here on the world. I added in this machine shop, zero to one K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com. So it's a free HTRI. And I will leave a link in the description. If you'd like to use the same HTRI that I'm using to help us get very realistic lighting and reflections in the material. And then also, if you don't have the node Wrangler add-on enabled, you can just click on edit and then open up the preferences. And then right over here on the add-ons, you can just start to type in node and then just check mark the node Wrangler add-on. So it's built in a blender and I'll show you how to use it in the video. All right, let's just click on new here to make a new material. Now I also want the same material to be on the Suzanne head. So I'm going to click and drag and drop the color right here. And that way the material will be on both of these objects. All right. So to start off, I'm going to press shift day and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Let's just drop it down here. And then using the feature from the node Wrangler with the selected, I can press control T and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I'm just going to take the object and plug that into the vector and then we don't actually need the mapping. So I'm going to select it and press X to delete it. So we're just going to use the object coordinates into the noise texture. And that way the noise texture will be placed around the object more evenly. And then also to preview what the noise texture looks like, I can hold down the control and shift key and click to preview the noise texture. Now on the scale here, I'm going to change the scale to four, and then I will turn the detail all the way up to 16. So it has lots of detail. And then let's also turn this roughness up here to 0.7. And you can see that gives even more detail and roughness in there. So now I want to change the colors. So it looks like painted metal with some rust. So to do that, I'll press shift day and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. Let's just drop the color of node right here. And then you can control shift and click on it to preview it. So now we can change the colors in here and we can make the rust and also the painted metal. So I'll take this first color tab and I will drag it kind of over here. And then I'm going to make this color a very dark brownish reddish color. And this is going to be the main color for the rust. So just something like that, very, very dark and kind of a reddish brownish. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value and you can type in 3e1c14. So that is the hex value that I will be using. Now let's also hold down the ctrl key and click. And we're going to put another tab kind of right here. And this one is also going to be a color for the rust. So this one is going to be a little bit brighter and then also a little bit more towards the brown and a little bit less red. And I will make it quite a bit brighter. So something like that. So you can see this is really starting to look like rust. And again, if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using over here on the hex, you can type in 843d2b. Alright, so there is our rust and that is looking really good. But now I want to add the painted metal. So I'm going to click on the black tab and I will drag it over kind of about here. And then I want to change this color to the paint color. So I'm going to make it kind of a bright color and somewhat yellow. And then also at the end of the video, I will show you how to change this to any paint color that you want. Now I have found that if you make it a super bright yellow, it actually looks a bit unrealistic. So I'm going to make it kind of a darker yellow and a little bit less saturated. And it will also make it look like it's a bit more worn. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can type in a hex value of c19b4d. So that's the color that I'll use for the paint. Now I want the paint to have a little bit more variation and I also want it to look like it's a bit worn. So I'm going to hold down the control key and click to add another tab. And I'll just bring this tab somewhere over here. And then this one, I am going to have a yellow color, but it's going to be a little bit more towards the orange. And the hex value that I'll be using for this one is a6692b. And you can see when I zoom in here, it makes the paint look a little bit more worn and adds a little bit more variation to it. All right. And then I do want to add one more color. I want to add one more color right in here. So I'm going to hold down the control key and click. And I'm adding this color because I want to make it look like the rust is kind of seeping out and almost staining around the edge of where it's rusty. So I'll make this one kind of an orangey dark color, kind of similar to this one. And the hex value that I'm using for this one is a25f22. And then I think I'll also drag these a little bit closer together. So they're kind of right next to each other. All right. So that is it for the color. So I'm just going to take this color here and put it into the base color. And then I can control shift and click on this to preview it. So that is starting to look pretty cool, but I do want to use this data to tell it where it's going to be metallic, where it's going to be rough and also where it's going to be bumpy. So what I'll do is I'll press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. Let's drop the color ramp node right down here. And then I want to take the color and put that first into the metallic. And then I want to control where it's going to be metal and where it's not. So I'll take this color ramp and just drop it right down here. So where the metal is painted, that is not a metallic material, but then where it's rusty, that is going to be metal. So what I'm going to do is actually flip these two values and then I can also control shift and click on it to preview it. And then I want to bring the black tab really close. So something like that. And I'll also bring the white tab out to make the white a little bit more strong. So we're basically creating a mask to tell it where it's going to be metal. So if I control shift and click on the final material, I can kind of look over here where the reflections are and you can see where the paint is on the metal. That doesn't really look very metallic, but then right over here where the rust is, that does look very metallic. All right, so that is good. So let's take this color and put it also into the roughness and then these wires are kind of going on top of each other. So I'm going to hold down the shift key and right click and drag and that will add a little tab here and then I'll bring this tab up here and then I can just box select these nodes and just kind of bring them down so that they aren't all overlapping. So the wires are not overlapping. All right, so let's press shift a and again I'm going to add another color ramp node and I want to drop this color ramp right down here. So this one is going to the metallic and then this one up here is going into the color and then this one will go into the roughness. So again, I want to switch these values and then I can control shift and click on this color after preview it and I want to kind of drag this over here and then I'll also drag the white tab over here. So I want to drag the black tab out a little bit and then I will drag the white tab out just a little and then I also want to make this white tab just a little bit darker. So just something like this. So I can now control shift and click on the final material and you can see that where it's painted it's more shiny, but then where the rust is it's very rough. So that is looking very good. So let's now take the color and plug that into the normal and then we need to convert this to normal data. So I'll press shift a and I'm going to search for a bump node. I'll just drop the bump node right down here and then this is color data and this is normal data. So to convert it, I need to plug the color into the height on the bump and that way it'll convert it to normal data. Now I want to control where it's going to be bumpy, so I'll press shift a and I'm going to search for another color ramp node. I'll just drop the color ramp right down here. So the color is going to go through the color ramp and then go through the bump. So I can now just control where I want the bumpiness to be and I want it to be really bumpy only where the rust is. So to do this I'm going to click on the white tab and drag it way over and you can see that now it's just being bumpy where the rust is. Now it is a little bit strong right now, so on the bump here I'm going to turn the strength to a 0.5 so it's a little less bumpy. So the material is almost done, but I also want to add a little bit of roughness and kind of some scratches on the painted metal just to make it look a bit more worn and old. So to do this I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for another noise texture. We'll drop it down here and then I want to plug this object here up to the vector on this noise texture and then I can control shift and click on it to preview it. Now the scale, I want to change this to a 4 and then I want to take this noise texture and I want to press shift d to duplicate it and drop it right down here. And then I don't want the factor to be going into the vector, so I'll unplug this. I want the color to be going into the vector. So what this is doing is this noise texture is going through the vector and so it's distorting how this noise texture is going to be placed on the object. Now for the second noise texture I'm going to change the detail to an 8.5 and then I'll also turn the roughness up to 1 so it has a bunch of roughness. So now if I control shift and click on it to preview the factor, if I zoom in here you can see it has a bunch of little swirls and tons of detail. So I now want to plug this into the bump. So I'll click on the bump and I'll press shift d to duplicate it and I'll just drop it right down here. Let me just move this over and then I want to take the factor of this noise texture and plug it into the height of our second bump. So this way we can add two bump maps together so the normal is going to go through the normal this one and then the noise texture can go into the height. Now if I control shift and click on the principled bsdf you can see this is very very detailed and it's almost like too rough. So I want to have more control over where the scratches are. So again I'll press shift a and we're going to search for one more color ramp. I'll drop the color ramp right down here and just kind of pull it over so the noise texture will be going through the color ramp and then go into the bump. So I can now use this color ramp to control where those scratches are. So I can just control shift and click on it to preview it and I want to drag the black tab out and then also drag the white tab out so this color ramp is now making those scratches very very contrasty. So I can now control shift and click on the principled and you're able to see those scratches a lot better. Now just a couple last things I want to do. I do want to invert this bump and that way the scratches will be going in instead of out and then also I do think they're a little bit strong so I'll change the strength value to a 0.3. But now if you kind of look around there especially in those reflections you can really see all those little scratches in there and that does look really cool and add a lot more detail to our final material. So let's say you want to change the color of the paint. I'm going to click on this yellow tab right here and I'm going to make it like a dark blue color or some sort of dark color. Now if you zoom in here you can see it's not just changing the paint color but it's actually kind of messing up the material and that is because we're making this a dark color and this color ramp is affecting the bump and the roughness and everything like that and so because this is now a dark color it's changing these masks and kind of messing them up so now where the paint is it's super rough. So I'm just going to press ctrl z to undo that. So this is really easy to fix. I'm just going to take this color ramp and I'll press shift d and just drop it right up here and then I want to take the factor and plug that into the base color and then I want to take this color and plug it right up here or plug it into the base color of the principled. So now this is a separate color ramp and so it's not going to actually affect these color ramps right here. So we can now change the color and it will just affect the color of our material. So if you want to make it like a blue paint I can just change this now to kind of like a dark blue color something like this maybe a little bit more blue and then I can also change this color right here as well to kind of a blue color something like that and now it is a blue paint. Also I think red does look kind of cool so if you want to change it to a red color and then right over here as well change this to kind of a darker red color maybe make this a little bit more saturated something like that. But I do like yellow best I think yellow does look really cool for instance construction equipment is usually painted yellow and also at a playground at a park they usually have like painted metal beams on the structure of the playground so I do think yellow looks pretty nice but you could change it to other colors if you want to just by duplicating the color ramp and then changing those colors. All right so I'll now render this out and we can take a look at the final thing. All right and that is it so that is the procedural rusty painted metal material. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and thank you so much for watching and again if you'd like to help support me and this channel I am trying to make blender content for a living so if you'd like to purchase this procedural material you can get that on my gumroad and my patreon I'll have the links in the description and I do really appreciate your support and I'll also have a link to my procedural material packs if you'd like to check those out. So thank you for watching and I hope to see you in a future video."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7BzYs91CI,Procedural Pool Tiles (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural pool tiles material using Blender's procedural nodes. The tutorial covers steps such as using a brick texture, adjusting the material properties, and applying bump mapping for a realistic effect. The video also highlights the use of the Node Wrangler add-on for efficient workflow and provides instructions for UV unwrapping when applying the material to different objects like a cube. Additionally, the tutorial promotes the creator's procedural material packs available on Gumroad and Patreon, which help support the channel.","In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural pool tiles material in Blender. If you'd like to purchase the project files and also help to support this channel, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have the link in the description. And also, this video is brought to you by my procedural material packs. So I create packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. So if you like using procedural materials in your artwork, then definitely check out these procedural material packs. And purchasing the packs is also a really great way to help support me and this YouTube channel. So here's the procedural material that we're going to be creating in the video. And then at the end of the video, I'm also going to show you how I would put this material on something like a cube. So what I did is I pressed shift A and I just added in an icosphere. And then on the add icosphere settings right down here, I just turned the subdivisions up to six so that it's very smooth. And then I also shaded this object smooth. Then I also added a cube and I just kind of rotated the cube over. And then over here on the modifier properties, I just added in a bevel modifier so that it has a little bit of a bevel and that'll make it look a little bit more realistic. And then I also added a plane and just added a subdivision surface modifier on it, and then added an emission material on it to get some nice lighting. And then also to help me get very realistic lighting, over here on the world, I added in this machine shop 021k HDR. And this is from polyhaven.com. So the link will be in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. And then just one last thing before we start, I am going to be using the node wrangler add-on. So if you don't have that enabled, just click on edit and open up the preferences. And then over here on the add-ons, you can just go to the search and you can type in node and then just turn on the node wrangler add-on. I'll show you how to use it in the video. All right, so I'm just going to select this sphere here and then we can click on new and I can just call this pool tiles. So I'm first going to start by pressing shift A and I'm going to search for a brick texture. I'll just drop the brick texture right down here. And then using the feature from the node wrangler, if I select the brick texture, I can press ctrl T and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I actually don't need the mapping, so I will press X to delete it and then I can just plug the object up to the vector. And then also using the other feature from the node wrangler, I can hold down the ctrl and shift key and click on the node to preview it. Now let's also click right up here and we're going to drag and drop the pool tiles material on this object as well. Now you can see that there are some issues with the placement of the brick texture, but I'll show you how to fix that after we create the material. All right, so the first thing that I want to do is I want to turn this offset to 1 and that way there isn't going to be any offset between the tiles. Now on the brick texture, the mortar size, I'm going to change this to a 0.07. And you can see that now the mortar is quite a bit thicker. And then I'm going to turn the mortar smooth to 1. And now if you zoom in, you can see that that's much smoother. Now you can see that the row height is different from the brick width. So to make it look much more like tiles, I'm going to change the row height to a 0.5 and that is the same as the brick width. So now they look much more like tiles. Now on the color here, I'm going to make the mortar fully white and then color 2, I'm going to make that a light blue color. So I'll make it very light and then just make it a light blue color, something like that. And then color 1 is going to be a dark blue color. So I'll just make it a lot more blue, more saturated, and a bit darker. All right. So just something like that. Those are the colors that I'm going to use. So now what I want to do is I want to put this into the bump because I want to make the tiles look like they're bumping out. So I'm going to take the color here and put that into the normal. And then we need to convert this to normal data. So I'll press shift A and I'm going to add a bump node. Let's just drop the bump node right down here. And then I want to put the color into the height on the bump here. And that way we'll convert it to normal data. So now if I control shift and click on the principled BSDF, you can see it looks like the mortar is popping out. Now there's a few things that I want to change with this because I don't want the mortar to look like it's popping out. I want the tiles to look like they're popping out and also they're popping out a little too much. So I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp node and I'll just drop the color ramp node right down here. Now I actually want to switch these two values and that way it's going to invert it. So now you can see that it looks like the tiles are popping out instead. And then I also want to drag this white tab over a lot. And you can see that now the tiles are a bit bigger and they're not popping out quite as much. And then I think I will bring the black tab out just a little. So if I control shift and click on this, you can see we're making it more contrasty. So it's more clear where it's going to pop out and where it'll be back in. And that might be a little bit too strong. So I think I'll pull this back a little bit, something like that. And then I also want to take the color on the brick texture and put that into the base color of the principled BSDF. So that's starting to look like a tile material. One thing that I want to do is I want to make it more shiny because pool tiles are pretty smooth and shiny and they also might be a little bit wet. So on the roughness here on the principled, I'm going to change the roughness to a 0.25. So it's much more shiny. Now I also want to give a lot more detail and variation in the color. So to do this, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a noise texture. We'll just drop it down here and then I can plug the object up to the vector. So we're going to use this noise texture to add a bunch of little colors in the base color. So let's now press shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp node, drop it down here. And then I'll take the factor and plug that into the factor of the color ramp. And then I can control shift and click on the color ramp to preview it. So there are a few things I want to do the noise texture. I want to change the scale to 150 and that way there's a lot more detail. And then I'll also turn this detail all the way up to 16. So it has even more detail. So now we can change the colors of the color ramp and that's going to change the colors of the noise texture. So I'm going to take the black tab and I'm going to make this a blue color. And this is going to be a little bit of a darker blue, somewhat saturated, something like this. And then also I can hold down the control key and click, and that is going to add a new tab. And then this one, I'm going to make a light blue instead. So just something like that, a nice light blue. And then I will also pull it over just a little. And then this one, I'm just going to leave this as white. All right. So we have this nice texture here. So now I want to add it in with the color. So to do this, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a mix RGB. Let's just drop the mix RGB right here. And then I'm going to take this color from the brick texture and put that into color two. Now on the mix here, I actually want to change it to multiply, and then I want to turn the factor all the way up to one. So now you can see it's adding these both together. We do have most of the brick texture, but then it's adding the little speckles and all the detail from the noise texture. So that is looking pretty cool, but I want the mortar to be fully white because I don't want the mortar to have any of those little blue speckles or anything. So what I'm going to do is click on this multiply and I'll press shift to duplicate it and drop it down here. And then I want to change it from multiply to add right down here. Just change it to add. Now, if I control shift and click on this color amp right here, we already have a mask for where the mortar is. So I can take the color and put that into the factor on the ad, and then I can control shift and click on this and then color two. I want to make that the mortar color, which is going to be all the way white. Now it is working, but it's flipped. So we need to flip it around. So I'm going to press shift day and I'm going to search for an invert node and I'll drop the invert node right in here between the color ramp and the ad. So that way it's going to flip the values. And now you can see that the mortar is white and then the tiles are those blue colors. So now I can plug the color into the base color and then control shift and click on the principal. So that is looking pretty cool. And we're almost done with the material, but I want to give it just a little bit more bump all over the place. So I'm going to take this bump and I'll press shift to duplicate it and drop it right down here. So I can now take this color from the color ramp and I can plug that into the height. Now you can see that it's going to be way too strong. It's going to add tons of detail right there. So on the strength here, I just want to turn this way down to a 0.1. And now you can still see that subtle bump in the reflections, but it's not too bumpy. And that is it. That is the finished material. Now, if you look right over here on a cube, if you're trying to add it on some sort of cube object or something like that, you can see that the mapping isn't really working very well. And that's because this brick texture on default doesn't really work the best, especially with using the object coordinates. It doesn't really work very well on objects like a cube. So what I'll do is I will duplicate the pool tiles material, and then I will change the texture coordinates for this object. So what I'm going to do is click right here and that is going to duplicate the material. I can now rename it to pool tiles cube or just rename it to whatever you want. Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to change this from object to UV. So instead of using the object coordinates, I'm going to use the UVs of this object. So I'll plug the UV into the vector of the noise texture and the brick texture. So now I just want to UV unwrap this cube, so I'm just going to tab into edit mode. And because this is a cube object, it works really well if I just press U and do the smart UV project and then click on OK. The smart UV project works really well for cubic objects kind of like this. So now I'm just going to hop over right here to the UV editing tab. And then we just need to play with the UVs to get it to the size that I want. So I will press Z and move my mouse down to go into the material preview. And then I can tab into edit mode. And because we're in the UV editing, you can see the UVs right here. So now I can just scale the UVs up to something that I like. And you can see if I keep scaling it, eventually it's going to align up. So the mortar is kind of on the edge there. And if for some reason they aren't aligning up, you can just press G to grab. And then I'm going to hold down the shift key to make my movements more sensitive. And you can just align the corners up. And that way the mortar is going to be on the corners. So just something like that. All right. So I'll just render this out now and we'll take a look at the final material. All right. And there we have it. So that is the procedural pool tiles material. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I hope it was helpful. And thank you so much for watching.

Now if you'd like to help support me and this channel and purchase the project files, then you can do that on my Gumroad and Patreon. Links will be in the description. So here is the procedural setup that we're going to be creating. It's actually not that complicated and I'll show you step by step how to create it. Real quick though before we continue, I wanted to thank this video's sponsor, Sketchfab. On Sketchfab, you can upload your own 3D models and preview them in your browser. You can even view them in AR, VR, or on a phone or tablet. You can also purchase 3D models and assets from Sketchfab's model store. You can even apply to sell your own models on the platform. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. Alright, now I will be doing this tutorial in the Cycles render engine because we are going to be using this displacement in the node editor. And also Cycles is just more realistic than AV. Now you can do this tutorial in EV, the displacement isn't going to work. As you can see, here's the sponge material in EV. You can see the displacement is doing something, but it kind of just acts like a bump. So you could use EV if you want, but I will be using Cycles for this tutorial. Alright, so let me just show you the setup that I have in the 3D view before we get started. So what I did is I pressed Shift-A and I just added an icosphere. And then right behind me on the Add Icosphere settings, I set the subdivisions to 6 so that it's very detailed. And then I also shaded it smooth. Now I'm also going to press Shift-A and I'm going to add a cube because it does make sense that you would add a sponge material to kind of a cube object or maybe a rectangle object because a sponge is usually a rectangle shape. Now for the lighting, I did just a few different things. So what I did is I added a plane and I just scaled the plane up and then I added an emission material to it and then I pointed it at the objects to light up the scene. And then also to help me get very realistic lighting, I went right over here to the world settings and I added in this Abandoned Hall 011k HDR and this is from polyhaven.com. So the link will be in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. And then there also are a few different settings that you need to turn on to use the displacements in the node editor. So what you need to do is you need to go right up here to the render properties and then you need to use the Cycles render engine if you want to use the displacement in the node editor. Then on the feature set here, I'm going to change this to Experimental because I'm going to be using the Adaptive Subdivision. Now if you don't want to use the Adaptive Subdivision, you don't need to turn this to Experimental. You can leave it to Supported, but I will be changing it to Experimental. So now we just need to click on New to add a new material and I can just call this Sponge. So now that we've added this material, I'm also going to click right here and drag and drop the material down on this object as well so they both have the same material. So now we need to tell the material to actually use the displacement. So to do this, I'm going to click right down here on the material properties and then I'm going to scroll down and right here under the settings tab, there is this surface and on the displacement right here, I want to change this to Displacement and Bump. And that way when we plug values into the displacement right here, it's actually going to displace the mesh. Now I also want to give more geometry to these objects because you can see this object does have a lot of geometry, but I want to add even more so that it has even more detail to work with. And then also this cube wouldn't work very well with the displacement because it doesn't have very much geometry. So what I'm going to do is click right over here on the modifier properties. Then on both of these objects, I want to click on Add Modifier and I'm going to add the Subdivision Surface Modifier. So this is going to subdivide the mesh, but what I want to do is I want to change this to Adaptive Subdivision. And what the Adaptive Subdivision will do is it'll add more detail where you're looking at the object. So if there's a lot of displacement detail kind of right here and you're looking really close up, it's going to add more detail closer up, but then farther away where you can't see it as closely, it'll be less detailed. Now you can see that this cube kind of turned into a sphere because of the subdivision. So from Catmull Clark, I'm going to change this to Simple and now it keeps its original shape, but it will still subdivide it. And then also the Dicing Scale here is going to control how much detail you allow it to use. So because this object has so little detail, I'm going to turn the Dicing Scale to 0.5 and that way it'll have more detail when it's using the displacement. So let's do the same thing for this object. So I'm going to click on Add Modifier and I'm going to add the Subdivision Surface. If it is being a bit laggy for you, then you might want to add an icosphere with less detail because this is pretty subdivided. So you could add an icosphere with less subdivisions. So I'm going to turn on the Adaptive Subdivision. And then again, because this is already pretty detailed, I'll just leave the Dicing Scale at 1. That works fine for me. And then just one final thing before we get started with the materials, I will be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you don't have that add-on turned on, you can just click on Edit and then click on the Preferences. And then to enable the Node Wrangler add-on, just click on the Add-ons tab. And then over here on the search, you can start to type in Node and then just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. And then we can just close the User Preferences. So to start off this material, I'm going to press Shift-A and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. And now because we turned on the Node Wrangler add-on, I can select this node and then I can press Ctrl-T and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I don't need the mapping, so I'm going to select it and then I'm going to press X to delete. Now I want to plug the object up to the vector so that it's using the object coordinates. And then using another feature from the Node Wrangler add-on, I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on this Voronoi texture to preview it. So I'm going to set the scale to 8 so it has a bit more detail. Now what I want to do is I want to press Shift-A and I want to search for a noise texture and I'm going to plug the noise texture right in here. So this noise texture is going to affect the vector and so it's actually going to warp this Voronoi texture. And then also I want to turn this detail all the way up to 16, which is the max, so that it is very detailed. So now I want to plug this distance here into the normal on the principled BSDF. Now if I hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on the principled, you can see that something is wrong here and that's because we need to convert this to normal data. So to convert it, I'm going to press Shift-A and I'm going to search for a bump node. We'll just drop the bump node right down here. So the distance value needs to be going into the height on the bump and then that'll convert it to normal data and then it can go through the normal. Now I also want to plug the distance here up to the base color, but that doesn't really look like a sponge material, so I want to change the colors in between here. So I'm going to press Shift-A and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. Let's just drop the color ramp right here and now we can change the different colors for our sponge. So I'll click on the black tab and then this one I'm going to make a bright yellow color. Of course you could make it any sponge color that you want, but yellow is a pretty classic color for a sponge. And if you'd like to use the exact same color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex and you can type in FFCA45. So that is the first color that I'm going to be using. Now the second color is going to be a very similar color, so it's going to be a bright yellow, but I'm going to make this one a little bit more saturated and a little bit darker. And again the hex value that I'm using for this second color, if you click over on the hex value you can type in FFC325. But I do want to make this sponge look like it's kind of dry. If you want to make it look more like a wet sponge, you could turn this roughness value down so it's more shiny, but I want it to be a little bit more on the dry side. So I'm going to turn this roughness value to a 0.6 so it's a bit more rough. Now also to make this look a lot more realistic, I'm going to turn up this subsurface. So the subsurface here, I'm going to turn this up to a 0.3 and what this will do is it will allow light to go through the material. Now what's also really important is to change the subsurface color. So I'm going to click on this white color right here, that is the subsurface, and I'm going to change this to a orangish color. And by changing it to an orange color, you can see that if I zoom in here the light that is passing through is kind of making an orangey reddish color. And again if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using for the subsurface color, if you click right over on the hex value you can type in E79500. So that is the color that I found to work best. So you can see that this kind of looks like a spongy material, but it doesn't really have all those little holes and little details. So that is where the displacement will come in. So first I'm going to take this noise texture and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and drop it right down here. And then I'll bring the texture coordinate down and I want to plug the object up to the vector. And then to preview the noise texture, I can hold down the ctrl and shift key and click on it to preview it. So I'm going to use this first noise texture to make some small little holes in the displacement. So I'm going to turn the scale value to 20 and then I'll also turn the detail to 1 because I don't want very much detail. And then I'll also turn the roughness to a 0.6 so it has a little bit more roughness. So now I want to make this more contrasty. So I'll press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp node and I'll drop the color ramp node right down here. So the factor is going through the factor of the color ramp and then just ctrl shift and click on the color ramp to preview it. So you can now start to drag these tabs together and it's going to make it much more contrasty. So I'll bring the black tab out to about here and the white tab kind of over here and you can see now there's just some little bits here and there. So that is the first layer of our detail but what I want to do now is take this voronoi texture and I'll press shift d to duplicate it and just drop it down here. Now again I want to take the object and plug that into the vector. So for this one I want to click on the f1 and I want to change it to smooth f1 and then also you can ctrl shift and click on it to preview it. And then the scale here I want to change that to 10 so it's a bit smaller. Now I also want to make it more contrasty just like this one so I'm going to click on this color ramp and I'll press shift d to duplicate it and just drop it right down here. And then I think that looks pretty good you could change these values if you want to but I'll just leave that how it is. So when we put this through the displacement it's going to use these black values to push into the mesh and make those little holes that you can see in the final render. So now let's make a third layer of detail. So I'm going to click on the noise texture and then hold down the shift key and click on the color ramp. I'll now press shift d to duplicate drop them down here and then I'll bring this texture coordinate down a little bit and again I want to plug the object into the vector and then I can ctrl shift and click on this color ramp to preview it. Now for this third one I want to add even more detail so I'll turn the scale value to 30 and then I'll also turn this roughness value back to a 0.5 because I don't want that much roughness. So I do want this noise texture to be a little bit more subtle I don't want to be able to see it as well so I'll drag the black tab back a little bit so it's harder to see and because I'm dragging this black tab back it's going to make the values more gray and if they're more gray then they're not going to be quite as strong in the displacement. Alright so let's create one more layer of detail so I'm going to click on this voronoi and then shift and click on the color ramp and I'll press shift d to duplicate it and just drop it right down here and then again I want to plug the object up to the vector on the voronoi texture and then I can ctrl shift and click on the color ramp to preview it. Now just like this noise texture I want this one to be very very small fine detail so I'm going to set the scale for this one to 20 so that the holes are much smaller and then I want to change the smooth f1 back to f1 and then I think I'll actually change the scale up to like a 25 because I do want those holes to be even smaller and then also this black tab I want to drag it back a little bit just like this one so that it's a little bit more subtle and that way it'll be a bit more gray and less strong. Alright so we now have these four layers of detail so I want to combine all of them and then put them into the displacement so to do that I'll press shift a and I'm going to search for a mix rgb I'll just drop the mix rgb right down here and then I can take this color and plug it into color 2 and then this one right here I can plug this one into color 1 so we can now ctrl shift and click on the mix to preview it. Now because this is a mix rgb right now it's just evenly blending between them so you can see this one is just the bottom one and then this one is just the top one but instead of just evenly blending between them I want to add the dark values so I'm going to click on this mix right here and I'm going to change it to darken that way it's just going to add the dark values and now when you turn this up it's just going to add those dark values but the white values won't be added. Now I want to actually change this factor to 0.5 because I don't want it to be super strong I want this to be a bit more gray so it's a little bit less strong you can see if I turn this up to 1 it's very dark and I don't want that so I'll just change this 2.5. All right so we have these two combined but I want to combine this one and then this one as well so I'm going to take the darken and I'll press shift d to duplicate it and just drop it right down here so now this darken can go into color 2 and then we can plug the next layer of detail the color into color 1 so then you can just ctrl shift and click on this now for this one I want to change the factor all the way up to 1 so it's adding all of those values so I just want to add the last one so to do that we're going to do the same exact thing so I'm going to take this darken value and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it and drop it right down here and then this color ramp from the top one I'll plug it into color 1 and then this darken here is going to go into color 2. All right so there we go we now have our color data for our displacement so now we need to press shift a and we're going to search for a displacement node so just drop the displacement right here because we need to convert this color data to displacement data so I'm going to take the color here and plug that into the height and then I'll take the displacement output and plug that into the displacement on the material output so I can now ctrl shift and click on this to preview it now it's way too strong right now you can see that's very strong so I'm going to turn this mid-level to 0 and then I'm going to turn this scale value to a 0.05 so the scale value if you turn that down it's going to be less strong so I like 0.05 I think that looks pretty good and there we go that is the finished material all right so I'll just give this a render and we'll take a look at the final thing and it finished after 11 minutes of rendering now my GPU actually ran out of memory the first time I rendered this and that's probably because my screen recording software is also going but what I did is I changed the dicing scale just to 1 on the cube and then on the sphere I changed the dicing scale to 5 so you might want to make the dicing scale a little bit less detailed so turn the values up and then they'll be less detailed but as you can see here the result looks pretty good now also I did want this image to look really nice so I rendered it with 300 samples of course you don't have to render it with that many samples and then also I wanted the resolution to be very high quality so over here on the output properties I changed the resolution scale to 200 now also to help get rid of a little bit of the grain that was on the image I went over here to the compositing tab and I clicked on use nodes and then I just added a denoise node and that way it just denoises the image and kind of smooths it out so that you can't see the noise but there we go that is it so that is the procedural sponge material so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and thank you so much for watching and again if you'd like to help support me and this youtube channel and also purchase the tutorial files then you can get that over on my gumroad and patreon with the links in the description but thank you for watching and I hope to see you in a future video"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0as60voirQ,Procedural Gravel Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural gravel material using Blender's procedural nodes. The tutorial covers setting up the initial scene with an icosphere, camera, and lighting, and then guides viewers through creating two different gravel materials using Voronoi and noise textures. These materials are mixed with a mask to create varied textures. Additionally, the video promotes the creator's Gumroad store, Patreon, and procedural material packs as ways to support the channel and offers links to related resources and other tutorials.","In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural gravel material in Blender. Now if you'd like to purchase the project files and also help to support this channel, then you can do that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page. I'll have links in the video description. And also real quick before we start, this video is brought to you by my procedural material packs. So if you like using procedural materials in your artwork, then definitely check out these procedural packs. So I create packs of 10 realistic procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes. I'll have the links in the description if you'd like to check out the procedural material packs. And purchasing the packs is a really great way to help support this YouTube channel. And if you'd like to learn how to create all of these procedural materials yourself, then I have a tutorial playlist on my YouTube channel where I show you how to create all of the different procedural materials. Alright, now I just wanted to show you my setup in Blender before we get started. So I just pressed Shift A and I just went right here and added an icosphere. And then right behind me, if you click on the add icosphere settings, I turn the subdivisions up to six so that it's very detailed. And then I shaded it smooth with the object context menu. Then I added a camera and pointed the camera right at the sphere. And then also I added in some plane lights. So I just added these planes here. And then in the cycles render engine, I added an emission material and just pointed them right at the sphere so that we get some very nice lighting. And then also just to help to get very realistic lighting. I also went over here to the world and I added in this abandoned hopper terminal 1k HDR. And this is from polyhaven.com. So if you'd like to use the same HDRI that I'm using to help light your scene, I'll have the link in the description. And then to help us create this procedural setup, I will be using the node wrangler add on. If you don't have that turned on, just click right up here and edit and then open up the preferences. And then right over here under add ons under the search, you can just type in node and then just turn on the node wrangler add on. Let's just close the user preferences. Alright, so to get started, I'm just going to click on new. And then I can just call this procedural gravel. So I actually want to create two different materials. So we're going to be using two different principled BSDF. And then we are going to be mixing them together. So let's create the first one. So I'll press shift a and I'm going to start by adding a voronoi texture. And then using the feature from the node wrangler, I'm just going to make sure this is selected. And then I'm going to press Ctrl T. And that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now I don't need the mapping node. So I'm just going to press x to delete it. And then I want to plug the object up to the vector. And that way, it's going to place the voronoi texture around the object more evenly. And then also using the other feature from the node wrangler add on, I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on nodes. And that will preview the node on our object. So I'm going to use this voronoi texture to make it look like there's some little pebbles and little rocks and the pieces of gravel. So what I'm going to do is turn the scale up to a 65 so that it's very detailed. And if I zoom in there, that looks really good. Now it right now it looks kind of like circles or little dots. And I don't really want that I want it to look like little chunks of rocks and little pebbles and things. So on the F1 here, I'm going to change this to distance to edge. And now you can see that looks a lot more like little pebbles and rocks, but I want to play around with how many of those rocks I can see. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. And I'll just drop the color ramp node right here. Now I want these little pieces of rocks to be a bit smaller. So I'm going to drag the black tab out. And when I drag the black tab towards the white tab, you can see it now there's more black. And so those little white pieces are a bit smaller. And then this white tab, I'm also going to drag it closer so that it's sharper. And then I also want to change this from white to gray, I don't want it to be super bright. So I'm going to make it a gray color. And then I will drag these a little bit closer to each other. So it's a little bit more contrasty. Alright, so that is very good. So we have some little chunks of pebbles and rocks. But now I want to add something else in the background to kind of look like dirt and rock as well. So I'm going to press shift day and I'm going to add a noise texture. And I'm just going to drop the noise texture right down here. And then I want to plug the object up to the vector. And then let's control shift and click on the noise texture to preview it. Now I want to make it more detailed. So I'll turn the scale up to 15. So it has more detail. And then we can also turn the detail all the way up to 16. So it's very detailed. And then I will turn the roughness up to a point six, so it has a bit more roughness. Alright, now this doesn't really look like rock and dirt. So I want to press shift a and I want to search for a color ramp node. And I'm just going to drop the color ramp node right in here so that we can play around with the colors. And then just control shift and click on the color ramp to preview it. So I first want to drag this tab out and then I want to change it to a brown color. So I'm going to make it a bit lighter and they'll turn it to a brown color. And I don't want it to be very saturated. So it's just going to be a little bit brown, something like this. And if you want to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value. And you can change the hex value to 4f43 3d. And then this white tab right here, I'm going to change it to a gray color. So it looks a bit more like rock and gravel. So now I want to mix these both together. Because if I control shift and click on this, I have this one here. And this is the little pieces of rock. And then this is also just like the rocky ground. So to mix them together, I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a mix RGB. And I'll drop the mix RGB right down here. And then I need to move this over. So I have a little bit more space. Alright, so I'm going to plug this top color ramp into color two. And then this bottom color ramp, I'm going to plug into color one, then on the mix here, I want to set this to add, so I'm going to change it to add. And now when I turn the factor up, it's going to start to add the pieces of rocks. So you can see if I turn the factor all the way to one, it's adding it a lot. But then if I turn it down, you can only see it a little bit. So on the factor here, I actually want to change this to a point three. And that way you can start to see those rocks coming through, but it's not super strong. So now I can plug the color up to the base color so that we can see that and then I'm just going to control shift and click on a principle to preview that. So that is looking pretty cool. But it's not very bumpy, it's actually really smooth. So I want to take this color here and I want to plug it into the roughness to give it a lot more bump. Now we need to convert this to normal data because you can see there's a shading issue. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a bump node. And I'm just going to drop the bump node right in here. So this bump node is going to convert our color data into normal data, because this color here is yellow. So we're going to plug this one into the height value. And then that is going to convert it to the purple here, which is normal data. So the normal will go right down here into the normal on the principle BSDF. And then also gravel is pretty rough. So on the roughness value here, I'm going to change it up to like a point six. So it's a bit more rough. Alright, so that is the first part of our gravel material. Now I want to select this principle BSDF, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate. And I'll just drop it down here, because I want to make a second gravel material and then we'll mix the two together. So this material output, I'll just kind of put it in the middle. And then I can control shift and click on the principle BSDF down here to preview that. So for the second material, I can actually use this same noise texture as our base. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color amp node. And let's just drop the color node right here. And then this noise texture right here, I can plug the factor up to the factor on the color ramp. And then I'm just going to control shift and click on the color ramp to preview it. So this first tab here, I'm going to drag it out a little bit. So there's a bit more black. And then I'm going to hold down the control key and click and that will add a new tab. You can also just click on the plus button right there. So then this color in the middle, I want to make it a dark gray color. And then I want to make it very, very slightly brown. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click right over here on the hex value and you can type in 5F5C58. And then this tab right over here, I'm going to make this one just a gray color, kind of a lighter gray, just something like that. Alright, so now I can plug the color into the base color and I can control shift and click on a principle to preview that. So that's kind of starting to look like a rocky gravel, but again, it's very smooth. So I'm going to take the color here and plug that into the normal. And then we need to convert this to normal data because the yellow is going into the purple. So I'm going to press shift day. And again, I'm going to search for a bump node. Let's just drop the bump node right down here. And then again, we want the color to be going into the height and that will, it'll convert this color data to normal data. And then if you zoom in here, you can see that it is pretty strong. So I'm going to change the strength value to a 0.2 on the bump node. So it's less strong. Alright, so now I want to add some sort of texture to make it look like there's little rocks in this one as well. So I'm actually going to go right up here and I'm going to take this Voronoi texture and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and drop it right down here. And then I can also take the object and plug that into the vector on the Voronoi. So then I can control shift and click on the Voronoi texture to preview it. Now this one, I want the pieces of rocks to be even smaller and even more detailed. So on the scale here, I'm going to change this to 80 so that those pieces are even smaller. And then again, I want to control how sharp they are. So I'll press shift day and I'll search for another color ramp node and I'll drop the color ramp right down here. And I want to plug the distance into the factor, and then I can just control shift and click on the color ramp to preview it. So I want to make this very sharp. So I'm going to take the black tab and pull it out a little bit. And then I'll pull the white tab really close so that it's very sharp and maybe just bring them both over a little bit. So there's not quite as many of them. So something like that is pretty good. So now I want to take this color right here and I want to plug it into the bump so that it looks like there's some little bits of rock bumping out. So this bump node, I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and drop it right down here. So I can now take this color and I can plug it into the height and that way it'll convert it to normal data. And then you can see that we have this extra normal right in here. So I can take this normal and plug it into this normal. And now it's going to add both of these bumps together. So I control shift and click on this, you can see there's this one, and then I can control shift and click on this one. And you can see that it's adding them both together. Now the rocks from the first bump are a little bit hard to see. And that is because the strength is so low. So I'm going to turn the strength all the way up to one. And now those little rocks are really popping out of that first bump. So I can now control shift and click on this principle to preview that. And you can see that's very detailed. Alright, so we now have this first gravel material and this second gravel material. But I want to mix these together to make a really cool gravel material. So to do this, I am going to take this noise texture, and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate. And I'll just drop it right down here. And then I want to plug the object into the vector. And then I think I will just pull this down and drag this noise texture a little bit closer, kind of over here in between the two materials. And I'll just give a little more space. So I'm just going to open these up so there's a little bit of space in between. So I'm going to use this noise texture right here as a mask to tell it where it's going to be the first gravel and where it's going to be the second gravel. Now the scale is a bit too big. So on the scale value, I'm going to change this to an eight. So it's a bit smaller. Now I need to make this much more sharp because it is kind of gray right now. So I'll press shift day and I'm going to again search for another color ramp node and I'll just drop it right down there. Now I can start to drag these tabs out and I'm going to make them closer together so that it's much more contrasty. Alright, so now I just want to mix these two together. So I'll press shift day and I'm going to search for a mix shader so that we can mix two different shaders together. So I'm just going to control shift and click on this mix shader. And then I'm going to plug the first one into the top shader and then this bottom one into the bottom shader. Now right now it's just evenly blending between them. And if you change the factor, it's going to be the first one and the second one, but I don't want it to evenly blend between them. I want to be some little patchy areas to be one gravel material and then some other areas to be the other. So that is where this mask comes in. So I can take this color data and I can plug it into the factor and then that'll tell it that some parts will be one gravel and then some parts will be the other. So now you can just play around with this color ramp. So if you want more of it to be one material, you can kind of drag these over a bit and you can see it's a bit more of the top material or you can drag them both over a little bit over here and you can see that's going to be more of the bottom material. So really you can just play around with these values and get it to how you like. So what I found to work best is to put the black tab kind of right here and then the white tab kind of over here. So I'm just going to give this a render and we can take a look at the final thing. And there we go. So that is the procedural gravel material. So thank you so much for watching this tutorial. I hope you learned a lot and I hope you enjoyed it. And if you'd like to help support this channel and also get the project files, then you can check that out with the links in the description.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHPHAwiqIpQ,Procedural Asteroid Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural asteroid material in Blender, using various Blender tools and add-ons like Node Wrangler and Mesh Extra Objects. The tutorial includes steps for creating an asteroid model with a rock generator, setting up lighting, and using noise and Voronoi textures to add detail and bump to the material. The creator also discusses setting up displacement using the Cycles render engine and provides tips on adjusting the material's appearance. The video is sponsored by Sketchfab, and the creator encourages viewers to support the channel through Gumroad or Patreon, where tutorial files can be purchased.","In this tutorial, we're going to be creating this procedural asteroid material in Blender. Now, if you'd like to help support this channel and also get the tutorial files, then you can do that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon. I'll have links in the video description. And also, if you like using procedural materials, then you might want to check out my procedural material packs. So I create packs of 10 procedural materials created with Blender's procedural nodes, and purchasing those procedural material packs is a great way to help support the channel. I also have a playlist on my YouTube channel where I show you how to create all of the different procedural materials. And then just one last thing before we start, I wanted to give a huge thanks to Sketchfab for sponsoring this video. Sketchfab has a huge 3D model store where you can purchase models and assets. You can even upload your own 3D models on the platform. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can preview 3D models in your browser. You can also preview 3D models on a phone or tablet. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. All right, now, before we start, we're going to be enabling two different Blender add-ons. So just click right over here on edit and then open up the preferences. And then right over here on the add-ons, just go over here to the search. And I'm going to start to type in node. And then I'm just going to turn on this node wrangler add-on. I'll show you how to use it later on in the video. Now, also, I'm going to show you a super quick and easy way to create an asteroid model. Right over here on the add-ons, again, on the search, you're going to start to type in extra. And then you're going to turn on the add mesh extra objects. So just checkmark this. And then I will show you how to use it in a moment. All right, so now you can just close the user preferences. All right, so I am going to be adding this procedural asteroid material on this sphere right here. But I thought it would be cool to also add it on an asteroid object. So let me show you how to create this asteroid object. I'm going to press shift A. And then I'm going to go to mesh. Now, because we turned on that cool add-on, the add mesh extra objects, you can see that there are a bunch of different options here to add extra objects. So right up here, you can see that there is this rock generator. So I'm just going to click on the rock generator to add in a rock. So then right down here behind me, you can see that there is that add rocks button. You can just open this up. And it's going to open up this panel here. Now, don't move the rock. Because if you move the rock or scale it or anything like that, it's going to get rid of these settings. So you can see that there is a number of rocks. There's also like the scale and all these things like that. So you can actually create rocks. But what I want to do is I want to make an asteroid. So right down here, you can see that there is this presets. So on default, it's set to default. But what I want to do is I want to click on this and then change it to asteroid. And check that out. You can see that Blender is procedurally creating this asteroid object. And then also you can click on the use a random seed and turn that off. And then you can just start to play around with the seeds. So just change the seed value. I actually like the seed value set to three. That looks pretty good. I really like that asteroid. So I can just click on this now to close that. And if you tab into edit mode, you can see that this is actually a very, very simple object. But if you click right over here on the modifiers, you can see that Blender has automatically added in some modifiers. So it's added in some subsurf modifiers to give it more detail. And then it's using all of these displacement modifiers to create the asteroid. So now I can just move this into place. So I'm just going to go into the camera view. And I'm just going to kind of move these over here. Maybe scale them down a little bit. And then also for this sphere here, I just pressed shift A. And I added an icosphere. And then again, right behind me, if you click on the add icosphere settings, I just turned the subdivisions up so that it was very smooth. And then I also shaded this object smooth using the object context menu. And then also to help me with the lighting, I went right over here onto the world properties. And I added in this Machineshop 02 1K HDR. And this is from polyhaven.com. So if you'd like to use the same HDRI that I'm using, I'll have the link in the description. And then I didn't want the strength to be super, super bright. So I turned the strength to 0.8. So it was a little bit less strong. And then I did want a very bright light shining on these asteroids. So what I did is I pressed shift A and I added a plane. And then on this plane here, I added a subdivision surface modifier so that it's circular. And then right over here on the materials, I just added a material and I changed it to an emission so that it is emitting light. All right. So I am going to be using displacements within the material in Blender. If you don't want to use displacements, you don't have to. It's totally optional. But I'm going to be using displacements. So let me just show you what we need to do to set up the displacement. So first, I'm just going to click on new here to add a new material. And I'm just going to rename it to asteroid. Now to get the displacements to work, we're going to click right over here on the render properties. So if you want the displacement in the material to work, you need to set it to cycles because Eevee doesn't support the displacement in the materials. So just set this to cycles if you want to use the displacement. And then also on the feature set here, this needs to be set to experimental. So now what we need to do is we need to go right down here to the material properties and I'm going to scroll all the way down. And then right down here under the settings tab, if you open this up, you can see that there is a surface tab. And if you open this up, you can see that there are some displacement settings. So I'm going to click on this and I want to change it to displacement and bump. And that's telling the material that you can use the displacement. And then just one last thing I want to do, I want to click right over here on the modifier properties and I want to add a subdivision surface modifier. So I'm adding the subdivision surface modifier because I want to use this adaptive subdivision. So because we've turned on those other settings, we now have this adaptive subdivision setting. And then what this will do is it'll add more detail to the displacement where we need it. So where it's closer up to the camera, it's going to add more detail and then where it's farther away, it'll add less detail. All right, so now that's all out of the way, let's get started with the procedural material. So I'll press shift A and I'm going to start by adding a noise texture and I'll just drop the noise texture right down here. Now using the feature from the node wrangler, I can hold down the control and shift key and then click on this node and that is going to preview the node. So now we can see it on the model. And then also using another feature from the node wrangler with this noise texture selected, I'm going to press control T and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I don't need the mapping node, so I'm going to press X to delete it. And then I actually want to use the object and I'm going to plug the object up to the vector and that way it'll place the noise texture on the object more evenly. So on this noise texture here, I'm going to set the scale to six that it has a bit more scale and then I'm going to set the detail all the way up to 16. So it's very detailed. So there's a lot more detail in there. Now what I want to do is I want to have this noise texture with this detail, but then I also just want to have some big lumps of color, some darker colors and some lighter colors. So what I'm going to do is select this noise texture and I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and I'll drop it right down here. And then I can hold down the control and shift key and click on the noise texture to preview it. And then I also want to set the object up to the vector. Now on this noise texture, I want to set the scale to two and you can see that now there's just a bunch of big bumps of color. And then the detail, I'm going to set that to one and you can see now there's just these little lumps of color and that is what I want. So now what I want to do is I want to combine these two together so that there are some darker areas and some lighter areas, but then we still have all this detail right here. So I'm going to press shift A and to combine them, I'm going to add a mix RGB and I'll just drop it right down here. And then I want to plug the factor of the first one into color two. And then I want to plug the factor of the bottom one into color one. So I can now control shift and click on this to preview it. So now I want to click on this mix here and I want to change it to multiply. And so now when I turn this factor up, you can see that it just starts off with the big lumps of color, but then when I turn the factor up, you can see it's adding in all the detail from the first noise texture. Now I also want to add some little holes in the asteroid to make it look like maybe there are some craters and just add some more detail. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a voronoi texture and I'll just drop the voronoi texture right down here. So I can now plug the object into the vector right there and then I can control shift and click on it to preview that. And then the scale here, I want to set that to 10 so that there are a lot more holes. So now we can just add this to the color. So right here on this multiply, I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and drop it right down here. I can now plug the voronoi texture into color two and then I can plug this multiply this color right here into color one. So if I control shift and click on this now, you can see that it's adding the little dots there on top, but I want the dots to be a lot smaller and I want them to be very contrasty. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a ColorRamp node and I'll just drop the ColorRamp node right down here. So if I start to drag these two tabs out, if I control shift and click on the ColorRamp, you can see that when I drag the tabs out and when I drag them together, they're going to be more contrasty. So I want to drag them both pretty close, so I'm going to drag them both like that so it's very contrasty. So now if I control shift and click on the multiply, you can see that it's just adding those dots on top of our original texture. And then the factor right here, you can turn this down if you want to make it more subtle. And I do want to make it more subtle because I don't want it to be super, super dark like this. So the factor here, I'm going to turn that to like a 0.3 so it is darker, but you can still see it. All right, so let's now take this multiply and I'm going to plug the color into the base color and I can control shift and click on this to preview it. Now I want to change the colors a little bit more because I don't quite like how they are. So I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for another color ramp. Let's just drop the color ramp right down here. So I'm going to click on the white tab and then I will make this a very light color. It's kind of going to be like a light gray and then I'm going to drag it out so it's more contrasty. And then we can also control shift and click on it to preview it. And then I also want to add some more gray into this material. So I'm going to click on the plus right here and that's going to add a new tab. And I want this tab to be a lot darker so it's still going to be a gray color but it is going to be quite a bit darker and then I want to drag it out so that it adds a lot more darkness. You can see it's adding those little dark bits but it's not all over the place. All right, so let's control shift and click back on the principled BSDF and that looks a lot better. Now if you zoom in here you can see that it's actually not very detailed and I do want to make it very detailed. So to add even more detail to this material I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for another noise texture and I'll just drop this noise texture right up here. And then I can plug this object right here up to the vector again and then I want to control shift and click on the noise texture to preview it. So the scale here I'm going to set that to like a 30 so there's tons more detail and then I'll also turn the detail up to 16 so it's very detailed. And then the roughness here I'm also going to turn that to a 0.6 so it has a little bit more roughness. So now I just want to add all this detail here into the color. So I'm going to take this multiply and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and I'm just going to drop it right down here right next to it. So I can now take the factor and I'm going to plug that into color 2 and then color 1 is going to be this multiply right here. So I can now control shift and click on it to preview it. So when we turn up this factor it's going to add more and more of that detail. So I want to turn it all the way up to 1 so now you can see if I control shift and click on this there is it before and then if I control shift and click on this it's adding all that detail from the noise texture and then again I can control shift and click on the principled and you can see that has a lot more detail. Now you can see that this asteroid material is actually a little bit shiny but asteroids aren't very shiny because they are just kind of like rocks floating in space and so they are very dry so they're not very shiny and also rocks aren't very shiny. So I want to take this color here and plug it into the roughness so that we can control the roughness values. Now you can see that right now it's making it very shiny so I want to control the roughness so again I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for another color ramp and I'll just drop the color ramp right down here. So if you click on the black tab and change the color I'm going to make the color a lot brighter so it's very bright just something like that so you can see that the brighter you get it the more rough it's going to be so if you turn it down it is very shiny but if you turn it up it's going to be very rough. So now I want to put this data into the normal to give it some bump so I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for a bump node because we need to convert it to normal data so I'll just add the bump node right here and then I'm going to take the color from this multiply and I'm going to plug this into the height and then I can plug the normal into the normal. Now it is a little bit strong right now so I'm going to turn the strength down to like a 0.6 so it's not quite as strong. Now I do want to give it even more bump using this noise texture right here but I don't want it to be super strong because it is very noisy so this bump right here I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and I'm just going to drop it right down here so I just want the normal to be going into the normal so now we have this extra height value that we can add more data to. So I'm just going to take the factor from this noise texture the very detailed noise texture and I'm going to take the factor and plug that into the height and then you can see the final material has a lot more detail. Now it is too strong right now because it is very detailed so this bump node right here this second one I'm going to turn the strength down to like a 0.3 so we still have that detail in there if you click on this bump and press M to mute it you can see that there's not quite as much detail and then if you press M that will unmute it so you can definitely see that adds more detail but not too much. All right so that is pretty much it for the procedural asteroid material you can see that's really starting to look like an asteroid but now I want to add the displacement to make it all bumpy because right now this is just a circular object and so that doesn't really look like an asteroid it looks more like a moon right now. So to add the displacement I am going to press shift A and we first need to add the displacement node so I'm going to search for the displacement node and drop it right down here and then we can plug the displacement into the displacement on the material output. So now I want to go right back over here to the second multiply and I want to plug this color right over here into the height value on the displacement. Now the mid-level right here I'm going to turn that to zero on the displacement because I don't want any mid-level and then it is way too strong right now so I'm going to turn the scale way down to like a 0.15 just hit enter. All right and that looks really good so you can see that it definitely has some bumps there but it's not too strong. Now you could turn this up if you wanted to like you could maybe turn this to like a 0.3 or maybe even like turn this to a 0.5 so that looks very bumpy but I just want to change it to a 0.15 I do like that a little bit better for this circular material. All right and that is it that is the procedural asteroid material. Now I want to add it to this one as well so I can just click right here and then I can just click on this little button right here and this is the drop down and I'm just going to drag and I'm just going to drop it on this asteroid right here. Now if you zoom in here over to this asteroid you can see that we didn't really set this up to work with the displacement and so the displacement isn't really working properly and I believe that's mainly because the geometry isn't really best for a displacement but because this is already a really cool asteroid model I actually don't want to use the displacement. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to click right over here over here on the asteroid material I'm going to click on this button it kind of looks like two pieces of paper and that's going to duplicate it and now it's asteroid.001 So because I duplicated it it has the same exact data but it's a separate material. So I can now just click on the displacement right here and I can click on X to delete it and there we go now it's not using the displacement but because we've added this to an asteroid object it looks really cool it looks like an asteroid we don't really need that displacement and it does look really cool. All right and there we go so there is the finished procedural asteroid material. So that's going to be it for this video thank you so much for watching and I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and I hope it was helpful and again if you'd like to help support this channel and also purchase this procedural material then you can get that over on my Gumroad store in my Patreon page I'll have links down in the video description and that's a great way to help support this channel but thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope to see you in a future tutorial."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k3Q4o0gh4Y,Procedural Copper Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator guides viewers on how to create a procedural rusty copper material. The video details the step-by-step process, starting with setting up the 3D environment, including adding an Icosphere, a Suzanne monkey head, and appropriate lighting using a plane light and HDRI. The tutorial then delves into using Blender's node system, demonstrating how to utilize noise textures, color ramps, and mix RGB nodes to achieve the desired rusty, oxidized copper effect. The creator also highlights the use of the Node Wrangler add-on for easier node manipulation, explains the importance of bump mapping for texture details, and provides tips on adjusting color properties for a realistic appearance. Furthermore, viewers are encouraged to support the creator via Gumroad and Patreon, where project files are available, and are informed about additional procedural material packs and tutorials on the creator's YouTube channel.","In this Blender tutorial, we're going to be creating this procedural rusty copper material. Now if you'd like to help support me and this channel and also get the tutorial files, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store, and also my patrons on my Patreon page will be getting the project files. Now before we get started, I wanted to let you know about my procedural material packs. So if you're into procedural nodes, or if you like using procedural shading for your artwork, then these procedural packs would be great for you. And by purchasing the procedural material packs, this is also a great way to help support me and this channel. And also if you'd like to create these procedural materials yourself, then I have tutorials on my YouTube channel on how to create all of the different procedural materials. I'll have a link in the description to the playlist if you'd like to learn how to create them yourself. All right, now before we start creating this procedural rusty copper material, I wanted to show you the setup that I have. So what I did is I pressed Shift A and then I added an Icosphere. And then right behind me on the add Icosphere settings, I turned the subdivisions up so that it's very smooth. And then also I thought it would look nice to add on a Suzanne monkey head. So I pressed Shift A and I went over here to mesh and added a Suzanne monkey head. And then I added a subdivision surface modifier and shaded it smooth. And then also to get some nice lighting, I added in this plane light, and I added in a mission material to it so that it's shining a very nice bright light at the objects. And then also to help get some even more realistic lighting right over here on the world, I added in this HDRI and this is from polyhaven.com. So I'll leave a link in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. So I just downloaded the 1K version and then to add it in, I just clicked right here on this color on the world settings and I changed it to environment texture. And then I clicked on open and opened up the HDRI. And then also this HDRI is a little bit dark, so I did turn the strength up to three, so it's a little bit brighter. So let's get started now. So I'm going to click on new right here, and then you can just name this whatever you want. I'm going to name it copper. I'm going to be using the node wrangler add-on. So if you don't have that add-on enabled, you can just click right over here on edit and then open up the preferences. And then right over here on the add-ons, you can just go to the search and you can start to type in node. And then you can just turn on the node wrangler add-on and I'll show you how to use it in the video. Let's just close the user preferences. All right, so let's now press shift A and I'm going to start by adding a noise texture because I want to add a nice texture for our copper. Now I'm also going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a texture coordinate. I'm just going to drop the texture coordinate node right down here. And then I want to plug the object up to the vector and that way the noise texture will be placed around the objects more evenly. And then I can also hold down the control and shift key and click on the noise texture and that is going to preview it. And that is using the feature from the node wrangler. So you can hold down the control and shift key and click on nodes to preview them. Now also I need to click right up here and drag and drop this material onto the circle as well. So on the noise texture, I'm going to turn the detail all the way up to 16. So it's very detailed. And now I could plug the factor into the base color and then I can control shift and click on the principle BSDF to preview it. Now that doesn't really look like a copper material. So I want to add a color ramp in here to make the different colors for the copper. So I'll press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. And let's just drop it right down here in between the noise texture and the principal. I'm now going to click on the white tab and I'm going to make this white tab kind of a brownish color, but a little bit on the red side. And I do want it to be a little bit brighter. So something like that. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value and you can type in a hex value of 8E6F50. So that is the color that I'm going to be using. And also I'm going to click on the plus here to add a new color and I'm just going to leave it in the middle. And this one I'll make much more red and a bit darker. And again, if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can go over to the hex and you can type in 6B3E2E. So that's the color that I'm going to be using. And you can see now that definitely looks a lot more like copper. Now, because this is old, rusty copper, I do want to add some green bits into the copper. And yes, copper actually does turn green when copper is oxidized. When it's exposed to the oxygen after a long time, it can kind of start to rust and it can kind of start to turn that green color. You can look it up online if you'd like to learn more about how that happens. But basically copper does slowly start to turn green when it's oxidized and when it starts to rust. So what I want to do is I want to create a mask and then I want to use that mask to add some green bits onto our copper. So to do this, I'm going to click on this noise texture and I'm going to press shift D and just drop it right up here. Then I can plug the object up to the vector. So on the scale here, I'm going to turn the scale to like a 7. And then I want to turn the roughness here to a 0.7. And then you can control shift and click on it if you want to preview it. So you can see it has a lot of nice detail in there. Now I want to use this to make a mask. So I want to make it a lot more contrasty. To do this, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for another ColorRamp node and then I'll just drop the ColorRamp node right in here after the noise texture. So now I can start to drag these together and it's going to be more and more contrasty. Now I actually want to flip these because I want it to be inverted and then I'll just make that pretty contrasty, something like that. So now I want to mix these both together and then we can add the green rusty part of the copper. So I'll press shift A and to mix these together, I'm going to add a MixRGB and I'll just drop it right down here. Let me just move this out of the way and then I can control shift and click on the mix to preview it. So because this is the mask, I'm going to plug this color into the factor and now you can see that it's adding the white parts of the ColorRamp into the mix and it's adding it on top of the main copper. So now color two, I can make that a green copper color and you can see that now it's being added on top of this color. But after looking at reference images, I have found that it's not a very bright green. It usually is a little bit more blue and a little bit more shallow and kind of dark. So I'm going to make it a color like this. It's almost kind of like a grayish bluish color and if you'd like to use the same exact value that I'm using, you can click over here on the hex and you can type in 4B5A53. So that's the color that I found to work best. So I can now control shift and click on this and you can see that does look like little bits of rust on the copper. Now also because this is a copper material, it's metal, so I want to turn this metallic all the way up to one so it acts like a metallic material. Now I also want to add a texture in here to change the roughness because I don't just want to have one roughness value, I want a texture to do that. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this ColorRamp and I'll take the color and plug that into the roughness. So what this is going to do is it's going to make the copper more shiny but then where the rust is, it's going to be more rough. And that makes sense because rust usually is pretty rough but then metal usually is a bit more shiny. Now that is way too strong right now, so I want to control how rough I want it to be. So to control that, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for another ColorRamp node. Let's just drop the ColorRamp node right in there. So now I can change both of these colors. So the white tab, I'm going to make this a bit darker because I do want the rust to be a bit more shiny. And then this black tab, I'm going to make it a bit more gray because I do want the copper material to be a bit more rough. So just something like this, you can see that they're actually not that different. This one's just a little bit lighter and then this one is just a little bit darker. But if you look closely here, you can see that the rust is a lot more rough than the copper. All right, now this isn't very bumpy right now and I do want to make it bumpy, especially because it's old rusty copper. So to make it more bumpy, I'm going to take this noise texture right here. I'm going to take the factor and I'm going to plug that into the normal. Now we need to convert this to normal data. So I'm going to press shift A and to convert it, I'm going to add a bump node. We'll just click right here and then drag it down. So this noise texture, the factor needs to be going into the height and then that'll convert it to normal data. Now it is really bumpy right now and that's way too strong. So I'm going to change the strength to a value of 0.08. So it's much more subtle. If you zoom in there, you can see there's still some bump, but it is much more smooth. Now I also want to add some bump to the rust because the rust is going to be a little bit different of a bump. So this color ramp right up here, this is the mask for where the rust is. So I want to select this bump node and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and I'll drop it right down here. So now the normal is going through the normal. So then I want to take the color here of this color ramp and plug that into the factor. And now you can see that where there's that rust, it's popping out. And also if you want to, you could turn on the invert and then that way you can see that where the rust is, that's going to be going back in. All right. So that is looking pretty cool, but I do just want to add one more layer of bump to make it very detailed. So I'm going to press shift day and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. I'm just going to drop the Voronoi right down here. And then what I want to do is I want to use a noise texture to distort the vector. So this noise texture, I'm going to press shift D and I'm going to duplicate it and just drop it right down here. So now we can plug the object up to the vector right here. And then I want to take the color of this noise texture and plug that into the vector of the Voronoi texture. And then I can control shift and click on it to preview it. So you can see this noise texture is distorting the Voronoi. Now the Voronoi here, I want to change the F1 to distance to edge. And you can see now we have that really cool detail in there. And then this roughness here on the noise texture, I want to change that to a 0.6. So there's even more detail. So to add this to the bump, I'm going to take this bump and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and I'll drop it right down here. So I can now take this normal and plug it into the normal of this bump. So that way we can add multiple bump maps together. And then we need to convert this to normal data. So I'll plug the distance up to the height of this bump. So I can now control shift and click on the principled BSDF to preview the final material. The only thing I'm not sure about is if I prefer the rust to be inverted or not, because if it's not inverted, you can see that it looks like the rust is popping out a little bit. And I do like that look. But also if I turn on the inverted, it looks like the rust is going in slightly. So this is really just personal preference. You can change it to whatever you want. All right. And there we go. So that is the procedural rusty copper material. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and thank you so much for watching it. And also if you'd like to help support this channel and also get the tutorial files, then you can get that on my Gumroad and Patreon. I'll have links in the video description, but thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I hope it was helpful and I hope to see you in a future video."

The video is sponsored by Sketchfab, a platform for buying and selling 3D models. The tutorial covers setting up a 3D scene with lighting and HDRI for realistic effects and using Blender's Node Editor to create a lava rock texture with displacement for added realism. The tutorial concludes with compositing tips to enhance the final render, and viewers are thanked for their support.","In this tutorial, we're going to be creating this procedural lava rock material in Blender. Now, if you'd like to help support me and this channel and also get the project files for this tutorial, then you can purchase the project files over on my Gumroad store, a link will be in the description, and also my Patreons over on my Patreon page will be getting the procedural material as well. Links will be in the description. And also, real quick before we start, I wanted to give a huge thanks to Sketchfab for sponsoring this video. On Sketchfab's 3D model store, you can purchase models and assets. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can upload and preview your own 3D models in your browser. You can even view your 3D models on a phone or tablet. You can also apply to become a seller on the platform. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. Alright, so this is the procedural material that we're going to be creating. As you can see, it's actually not that complicated, but I will be walking you through the entire process in real time. And also, you don't have to do this if you don't want to, but I'm going to be using the displacement in the node editor to actually displace the rocks. So the rocks are actually going to pop out of the mesh. You can see here's without the displacement. It still looks like a pretty cool material, but if you add the displacement, it really pops out those lava rocks, it pops them out of the lava, and I think it gives a really cool result. Alright, so let me just show you the setup that I have in the 3D viewport. So what I did is I pressed Shift-A, and I added an icosphere, and then when you add the icosphere, right down here on the icosphere settings, you can turn the subdivisions up, and that way the sphere is going to be very subdivided and detailed. And then I also shaded it smooth. And then I also added a camera, and I pointed the camera right at the sphere. Now also, to get a very nice, bright light on the side here, I added in this plane light. So I just pressed Shift-A and added a plane, and then I subdivided it so it's kind of round. And then right over here on the materials, I added an emission material to it, and then I set the color to a yellowish-reddish color, and I turned the strength up to 60. And you can see that now we have that nice, bright light on the side of the object. And then also, to get even more realistic lighting, what I did is I added in this Abandoned Workshop 1K HDR, and this is from polyhaven.com, so I'll leave a link in the description if you'd like to download this same HDRI. So right over here on the world settings, I just changed this to environment texture, and then I opened up the HDRI. And then also, because the lava is going to be glowing, I turned the strength down to 0.5, and that way, the world lighting is a bit darker, so the light from the lava can really pop out. And then also, before we start, I am going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on, so if you don't have that add-on enabled, you can just click right here on Edit, and then click on the Preferences. And then right over here on the Add-ons tab, you can just start to search for Node right on the search here, and you can see that there is this Node Wrangler add-on. So you can just checkmark it, and then we'll be using it later in the video. Alright, so let's get started. So I'm just going to click on New right here, and then I can just call this material Lava Rock, or whatever you want to call it. Now, before I continue setting up more of the nodes, I want to set up the displacement. Now, you don't need to use the displacement if you don't want to, but if you want to use the displacement, let me just show you what you need to do to set it up. So the render engine needs to be Cycles, so make sure it's set to Cycles, and then the feature set here needs to be set to Experimental. And then make sure you've already added in a new material. So once you've added in that material, we're going to click right over here on the Material Properties, and I'm going to scroll down. Now, right over here on the Settings tab right here, you can see that there is this Surface tab in the Settings tab, and then there is the Displacement. So the displacement, it's set to Bump only right now. I want to set it to Displacement and Bump, and that way it's going to use the bump. Now, also I want to use the Adaptive Subdivision, and that way it's going to add more detail where we need it. So I'm going to click right over here on the Modifiers, and I'm going to click on Add Modifier, and I'm going to add the Subdivision Surface Modifier. And we'll just wait for that to load up. All right, so I added it in. So now just make sure that the Adaptive Subdivision is turned on, and then that way when we go into Rendered Mode, wherever we render the image, it's going to make sure that there is more detail where we can see it closer up. And then the Dicing Scale, I'm just going to leave that at 5 for now. That works pretty well. All right, so let's go into Rendered Mode, and then I'll just make this a little bit smaller, and we can set up the procedural material. So we need to make two different materials. We need to make a Lava Rock material and a Lava material. And then we're going to use a Mix Shader to combine them together. So I'm first going to start by making the Lava Rock material. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a Noise Texture. We'll just drop that right there. And then also, because we turned on the Node Wrangler add-on, I can select this node, and I can press Ctrl-T, and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now, I don't really need the mapping, so I'm just going to select it and then press X to delete it. And then I want to plug the object up to the vector. And then I can just Ctrl-Shift and click on the Noise Texture. So on default, the textures use the generated coordinates, but if you change it to Object, then that way the texture is going to be placed around the object more evenly. And then I'm going to leave the scale at 5. I think that looks pretty good. But I'm going to turn the Detail all the way up to 16, so it's nice and detailed. All right, so now I can take the Factor and plug that into the Base Color of the Principled, and then I can hold down the Ctrl-Shift key and click on the Principled BSDF, and that is going to preview different nodes. So that's using the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you hold down the Ctrl-Shift key and click on Nodes, then that will preview them. Now, this doesn't really look like rock right now, so to change the colors, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a ColorRamp node, and we'll just drop it right in here. So now we can change the tabs, and that's going to change the color of the rocks. So this first black tab, I'm going to drag it way out so there's a lot more black. And then this white tab here, I'm going to click on it, and I'm going to change it to a reddish-brownish color. So I'm going to make it a bit darker and kind of a reddish-brownish. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click right over here on the hex value, and you can type in 6D392C. All right, so you can see that's looking a little bit more like rock, but it is a bit shiny. So what I want to do is I want to take the Factor of the Noise Texture and plug that into the Roughness. And then I want to control how rough it is. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for another ColorRamp node, and we can just drop it right in here between the Noise Texture and the Roughness. So if you take the black tab and turn it up, it's going to make it more and more rough. So you can see if I turn it way up, it's going to be super chalky and rough, but then if I turn it down, it'll be more shiny. So you can see now it is a little bit shiny, but it still is pretty rough because it is rock. And of course, you can change this later if you'd like to. And then also, I want this to be contributing to the normal because rocks are very bumpy. So I'll take the Factor and plug that into the normal, and then we need to convert this to normal data because this is black and white data. You can see that it's the gray, but then this needs to be normal data because it's purple. So I need to convert it. So to convert it, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a Bump node, and we'll drop the Bump node right in here. And then what we want to do is we want to take the Factor and put that through the Height. It'll convert it to normal data, and now you can see that it's actually bumping that out, and that looks a lot more like rock. And then, of course, you can change the Strength if you'd like to. I want it to be very bumpy, so I'm going to keep the Strength at 1. All right, so that is looking pretty cool, but lava rocks usually have some little holes in the rock. So to add those, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture. I'll just drop the Voronoi right down here. And then I want to plug the object up to the vector on the Voronoi. And then I can also Control-Shift and click on it to preview it. So the scale right here, I'm going to turn this up to 60, and now you can see that there's a bunch of little dots. So now I want this Voronoi texture to be contributing to the bump. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift-D, and I'm going to drop this right down here. And then, actually, I want the Normal to be going into the Normal, and then I want to unplug this, and then I want the Noise Texture to be going back up to the Height. So this way, the Normal is going to the Normal, so we can add multiple bump maps together, and then this Noise Texture is going into the Height. So I can now take this distance value and plug it into our new bump. Now, if I Control-Shift and click on this, you can see what it's doing. So it's very bumpy, but the problem with this is that it's super, super bumpy all over the place, and I just want there to be some little bumps here and there, some little holes. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Let's just drop the color ramp right here. And then if I take this white tab and start to drag it out, you can see that now it's making those bumps smaller. So if I Control-Shift and click on this, you can see that it's making the bumps smaller and more contrasty. So now if I Control-Shift and click on both of these bumps, you can see this just adding in little bumps right in there. And if I Control-Shift and click on it, you can see now that has a lot more detail. All right, so that is it for the finished lava rock material. So I want to just join these together into a frame so that it's just organized a little bit better. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a frame. This is totally optional, but I like to do it to organize my nodes. So now that I've added the frame, I'm going to box select all these nodes. So press B and then drag around, but I don't want to box select the material output. Now I'm going to drag and drop all of these into the frame. And now if I drag the frame around, it's going to move all the nodes around. Now you can actually rename this frame if you want. So to rename it, I'm going to press N, and that's going to open up the side panel. Now the label right here, you can just change this to rock or lava rock or whatever you want. And then if I press N to close this, you can now see that it says rock. All right, so that is the first material. Let's now make the lava material. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for another principled BSDF, drop it down here. And then I can Control-Shift and click on this, and we can preview it. You can also move the material output kind of right down here in the center. So now I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for another noise texture. Let's just drop it down there. And then again, I want to use the object coordinates. So if you just select the noise texture, you can press Control-T, and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I don't want the mapping, so I'm just going to select it and press X to delete. And then I can plug the object up to the vector. And then I can Control-Shift and click on this to preview it. Now I want to turn the scale down to 4, and then I also want to turn the detail all the way up to 16 so it's very detailed. And then the roughness here, I'm going to turn this up a little bit to like a 0.6 so there's a little bit more roughness. And then I'm also going to turn the distortion up to 7. And when I turn the distortion up to 7, you can see that's looking a lot more like lava or some sort of liquid. Now I want to play around with the colors. Let's first plug the factor in to the base color. But then if I Control-Shift and click on this, you can see that doesn't look at all like lava. So let's press Shift-A, and I'm going to add a color ramp. Let's just drop the color ramp right in here. And now we can make all the different colors that we want for the lava. So I'm going to drag this black tab out to about here. And then this one, I'm going to make a orange color. So I'm going to turn it all the way up to white, and then I'll make it a very strong orange color. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value and you can type in FF8000. And then this one, this white tab, I'm going to drag it out as well to make it very contrasty. And then I'm going to make this one a very bright red color. And again, if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click on the hex and type in FF000F. So that is sort of looking like lava, but it isn't emitting light, and I want it to emit light. So as well as this being plugged into the base color, I also want to plug it up to the emission value. And then the emission strength, let's turn that up higher to something like a 20, so it's a lot brighter. Now I also want to plug this into the normal to give it some bump. So I'm going to plug the color into the normal. And then again, I need to convert it. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a bump node, and we'll drop the bump node right here, and then we can plug the color up to the height. And then also, I want to turn the roughness down to like a 0.1, just so that the lava is a lot more shiny. And that is it for the lava material. So it's actually pretty simple. Now I want to add this into a frame as well, just to organize it really well. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a frame. And then again, just box select all of these, and I'm going to drop them into the frame. Just like that, just drop them into the frame. And then you can click on the frame, and you can press N to open up the side panel. And on the label here, I'm just going to call it lava, and then press N to close that. And now you can see it says lava. Alright, so if I Control-Shift and click on both of these, you can see we have both of our two materials. And now I want to combine them together. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a mix shader. I'll just drop the mix shader right here. And then I actually want to plug the rock up to the bottom one, and then I want to plug the lava up to the top one. So then once I have these plugged up, I can just Control-Shift and click on the mix shader. So right now, we have this factor. So if I drag the factor, you can see it's just going to evenly blend it in between the lava and the rock. What I want to do though, is I want to tell it that some parts are going to be the rock, and some parts are going to be lava. So to do that, we're going to need to make a mask or a factor, and then we can plug that into the factor value. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. We'll just drop that right down there. And then again, I want to press Control-T to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And then I don't need the mapping node, so I'll press X to delete it. And then I can plug the object up to the vector. So let's Control-Shift and click on the noise texture now to preview it. Now the scale, I'm going to turn that down to like a 4, and then I'll turn the detail all the way up to 16, so it's very detailed. And then also, I'll turn this roughness value up to like a 0.7, so there's a bit more roughness. So we can now take this factor, and we can plug the factor into the factor on the mix shader. So I can now Control-Shift and click on this, and you can see that right now it's not really doing anything, and that's because I need to make it more contrasty, so that it's very clear where it's going to be the rock and where it's going to be the lava. So to do that, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. Let's just drop that right there. And then I actually want to switch these values. So I'm going to drag this black one all the way over here, and the white one over here. So now that I've switched these, you can see that when I drag the white closer to the black, it's going to be only the rock. And then when I drag it all the way over here, it's going to be only the lava. So now I just need to find somewhere in between that looks nice. Now if you zoom in really close, you can see that it's very, very sharp where it's lava and where it's rock, and I want to make that a little bit more smooth. So this black tab right here, I'm going to change this color to a very light color. And you can see that as I turn it up, if it's fully white, it's going to be all the rock. But then as I turn the color down, you can see that slowly the lava is starting to kind of seep through. So if you want to be very, very contrasty, you could just turn it down. But I want to turn it up so that the edges are a little bit more smooth and kind of blending together. And then you can also drag this light brown tab out a bit. And you can see that when I drag it closer and closer, it's going to make the lava even more contrasty. So you can see when I drag it really, really close, the yellow is really bright. So I don't want it to be super, super bright, but I do want to drag it out a bit. So that is looking really cool, but you can see that there's kind of too much red, and also the lava isn't glowing very much. So what I want to do is right over here on the lava material, I want to turn the emission strength up to like 100. And now that I've turned it up to 100, you can see that the lava is very, very bright. So if that's too bright for you, you could turn it down, but I want it to be very, very bright, especially because in the compositor, I want to add a glare node to make the lava glowing. Alright, so there's just one last thing that we need to do to make this material look really nice. We need to add the displacement. So to add the displacement, I'm going to drag the lava down a bit so there's a bit more space. And then what I want to do is actually shift select the texture coordinate and this noise texture. Then I'm going to press shift D to duplicate it and just drop it right down here. Now for this one, I want to turn the roughness down to like a 0.5 back to the default because I don't want quite that much roughness because that's going to be too noisy and it's not going to look very good for our displacement. So now what I can do is I can press shift A and I can search for the displacement node and I'm just going to drop it right down here underneath the mix shader. Then I can plug the displacement up to the displacement and then I want to plug this noise texture up to the height value on the displacement. Now the mid-level, I'm going to turn that to 0 because I don't want any mid-level and then the scale here, it's way too strong. You can see that's really, really strong. So I'm going to turn the scale down to a 0.02. I find that that is the best value. You could of course turn it up more if you want. Now it's not really doing too much right now and that is because I want to make the noise texture more contrasty because right now you can see it's not very contrasty. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search again for another color ramp node to make it more contrasty. Now again, I want to flip these values and now that I've flipped these values, you can see that the lava is kind of just flat but then the lava rock is actually popping out of the mesh. So I can control, shift and click on this and let's just change this value. So you can see that where it's white, that's going to be coming more up. So where it's fully bright, that's going to be popping out the most and then where it's black, it's not going to be bumping out at all. So you're really just going to have to play around with this and get it to how you like. So where it's going to be white, that's going to be more of the rock popping out. Alright, and then you can control, shift and click on the mix shader to preview the final material. Now there is just one thing that I want to change. I want there to be a little bit less lava because there's a little bit too much lava right now. So to make there be less lava right here on this color ramp, I'm going to take the white tab and drag it more towards the gray tab. And when I do that, you can see that now there's less lava. Alright, there we go. And then of course, if you want to change this scale right here on the displacement, if you want to make the rock popping out even more, you could turn it up to like a 0.03 or maybe even like a 0.05 if you want the rocks to really be popping out. That's too strong for me. I'm going to turn it down to a 0.02. I think that looks pretty good. Alright, so we will render this out and then we'll just do a little bit of compositing to make the lava glowing. So you can set up any render settings that you want. I'm just going to click on render and then click on render image or you can press F12. Alright, and it just finished rendering. So now let's set up that compositing. So I'm going to click right over here on the compositing tab and then I'm going to click on the use nodes. So now what I want to do is I want to press shift A and I'm going to search for the denoise node just to denoise the image to kind of smooth it out. So I'm just going to drop the denoise right there and then I can control shift and click on it and that's going to add the viewer node and then also make sure the backdrop is enabled and that's going to preview it. Now also, I want there to be like a dark black background. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for an alpha over node and I'll just drop the alpha over node right here. Now this image, I want to plug it into the bottom one and then this image right here, I'm going to make it fully dark or you can just make it a dark blue color or whatever you want. Alright, that is looking really good. Now there's just one more thing that I want to do to make the image look really nice. I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a glare. We're going to drop the glare right down here after the denoise and then just make sure the compositing in viewer is plugged up to that. So then right here on streaks, I'm going to change this to a fog glow and then right here on the low, medium or high, if you change it to high, then the glow is going to be a little bit smaller. You can see if I change it to low and then let that load up, you can see now the glow is a lot bigger. So you can really change this to whichever one you want. I think I'm going to change it to medium and that way it's going to be kind of in the middle. Alright, there we go. So if we just press F11, that's going to go back to the render result and then I can just click on this and change it to the viewer node and that's going to preview the final image. Now to save this image, you can just click on image and then you can just click on save as. So that's it for this tutorial.

Now real quick before we start, if you'd like to help support me and this channel and also get the project files for this tutorial, then you can get that over on my Gumroad store, the link will be in the description. And also if you join my Patreon over on my Patreon page, then you can get the project files as well. And one last thing before we start, I wanted to give a huge thanks to Sketchfab for sponsoring this video. Sketchfab is an awesome 3D model site where you can preview 3D models in your browser. You can even view them on a phone, tablet, or in AR and VR. They also have a huge 3D model store where you can purchase models and assets. You can even apply to sell your own models on the platform. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. Alright, so this is the procedural material that we're going to be creating for the procedural dry cracked ground. Now while we're creating the material setup, I am going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on, so if you don't have that enabled, you can just click right here on edit, and then go to the preferences. And then just click right over here on the add-ons, and over on the search here you can just start to type in Node, and then just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on, it's a really useful add-on, it's built into Blender, and I'll show you how to use it in the video. Alright, and then I'll also show you the setup that I have if you want to do the same thing that I'm doing. So I just pressed Shift-A and I added an icosphere, and then right behind me, those add icosphere settings, I just turned the subdivisions up so that it was very detailed, and then I shaded the object smooth. So this is my subdivided icosphere. And then I just added a camera and pointed it right at the sphere. And then also, to help me get very realistic lighting, I added in this BrickFactory 01 1K HDRI, and this is from polyhaven.com, so the link will be in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. And it just helps to get some very realistic lighting for our procedural material. Alright, so let's actually get started. So I just have the 3D view over here, and then I have the shader nodes right here. So I'm just going to click on New. So here is our principled BSDF. This is going to be the base for our material. Let's first start by adding a noise texture. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and then I'm going to search for a noise texture, and this is going to be the base for our color. Now I also want to press Shift-A, and I want to search for a texture coordinate. So here is the texture coordinate node. I'm just going to drop this right down here, and then I'm going to plug the object up to the vector on the texture coordinate. And then also using the feature from the Node Wrangler, we turn the Node Wrangler add-on on. So I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and then click on the node, and that's going to preview the node. So the Node Wrangler is a really useful add-on for previewing the nodes. So back to the texture coordinate, I use the object mapping because that places the noise texture around the object more evenly, and it's also great for putting the material on different objects. All right, so let's configure the noise texture. So let's turn the scale up to 6 so that it's a little bit more detailed, and then I'll turn this detail all the way up to 16 so it has a lot more detail. And then I'll also turn the roughness up to a 0.65 so it has a little bit more roughness and more detail as well. All right, and then we can plug the factor up to the base color, and then again using the Node Wrangler, I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on the principal BSDF to preview it. Now, that doesn't look anything like dirt because it's just white and black, so I'm going to press Shift-A and search for a ColorRamp node, and we're going to drop the ColorRamp node right in here. So now we can change the tabs in between this, and it's going to change the color so that when it goes into the base color, it'll actually look like dirt. So I'm going to leave the black one right where it is, and then the white one, I'm going to make this a light brown color. And if you'd like to use the same exact color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value, and you can punch in CCB180. So that is the light brown that I'm going to be using. And then let's also click on the plus here, and that's going to add a new tab. And then this one, I'm going to make a darker brown color. And again, if you'd like to use the exact same color that I'm using, over here on the hex value, you can type in 955E2F. And then also I'm just going to bring it back just a little bit so you can see a little bit more of the light brown. Now I also want to add some little dots, and I want to add that into the color as well as the normal to make it look like there's some pebbles and things like that. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a voronoi texture. I'm just going to drop the voronoi texture right underneath the noise texture, and then I want to plug the object up to the vector. And then we can Control-Shift and click on the voronoi texture to preview it. Now the scale, I'm going to turn this up to like a 50 so that there are a lot of dots. And then also on the F1 here, I'm going to change this to smooth F1 so that the dots look a bit better. Now I want to make the dots more contrasty, so to do that I'm going to press Shift-A, and we can just search for a color ramp node. I'll just drop the color ramp node right here. And then if we start to drag these out, it's going to make the dots more contrasty. So I'm just going to bring the black one out a little bit, and then also bring the white one in a lot. And now if you zoom in here, you can see that those dots are very contrasty. So now I want to add these dots in with the base color. To do that, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a mix RGB so that we can mix these in with the color. And then I can also Control-Shift and click on the mix RGB. Alright, so I'm going to put the bottom color ramp into the factor, and then I'm going to take the base color and put that into color 2. And then if you Control-Shift and click on the mix, you can see that now it's adding those dots on top, and they are white. Now color 1, if you change that, that's going to be the color of the dots. So I'm going to make the dots a little bit darker brown color, and if you want to use the same hex value that I'm using, I'm going to be using a hex value of 855126, so just a little bit darker brown. And then I can Control-Shift and click on the principled, and we can see that. Alright, now I also want those dots to be contributing to the normal to make it look like they're bumping out a little bit. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for the bump node, and I'm just going to drop it right down here. And then I'm going to plug the normal up to the normal on the principled. So now I can plug the color from this color ramp up to the height, and then I can Control-Shift and click on this, and you can preview it, or just click on the principled BSDF, and you can see that it's bumping in those dots. Now I actually don't want it to be going in, I want the dots to be popping out, so I'm going to click on the invert button, and now the dots are going to be popping out. And then they are a little bit strong right now, so I'm going to change the strength down to like a 0.31, and then they're still there, but they're a bit less strong. And then I also want the noise texture to be contributing to the bump as well. So I'm going to press Shift-D and duplicate the bump and just drop the bump right down here. Now I need to switch these around because I want this bump to be going through the normal, and that way we can add multiple bumps together, and then I'm going to plug the color ramp up to the second one here, so on the height. So the height is going to just convert any data into normal data. So now we have this second bump here, and I'm going to take the color ramp up here, this color ramp, and I'm going to plug that up to the height. And now you can see that it's adding in all that detail from the noise texture. And then I do want it to be a little bit more strong, so on the strength here, I'm going to turn this one up to like a 0.57, so it's quite a bit stronger. And then I'm also going to turn off the invert on this first one, the one that the noise texture is going through because I don't want it to be inverted. All right, so there we go. You can see it's already starting to look pretty cool. It's looking like some dry ground, and it is pretty detailed. But I want to add another small layer of detail. So I'm going to press shift A, and again, I'm going to search for a voronoi texture. I'm just going to drop the voronoi texture right down there. And then the object, again, I'm going to plug that up to the vector. So I can now control shift and click on it to preview it. Now again, this one, I want to change to smooth F1 so that it has a bunch of dots. And then I'm going to turn the scale up really high to like a 250. So now if you zoom in here, you can see there's all these super tiny little dots. And then again, I want to make them contrasty, kind of like this one. So this color ramp here, I'm going to press shift D and duplicate it and just drop it right down here. But then I do want to be able to see the dots a little bit better. So I'm going to pull the white out a bit and then pull the black in a bit, just so that they're a little bit more in the center. So something like that is pretty good. And you can now see if you zoom way in, there's just a bunch of tiny little dots. So I'm going to use this to add even more detail to our bump. So I'm going to click on this bump and then I'll press shift D to duplicate it and just drop it down here. And then we just want the normal to be going through the normal. So now we have this extra height value. So what we can do is we can plug the color up to the height. And then also the invert, I'm going to turn that off again. So I can now control shift and click on this to preview the entire thing and also control shift and click on the final thing. And you can see if you zoom way in here, it's just giving a tiny little bit more detail. And then I think I'll turn the strength down to like a 0.28 just so that it's slightly less strong. So it is very subtle, but you can especially see it if you control shift and click on the bump. There's just a bunch of tiny little dots right there. All right, so now I want to add some little chunks and things around the dirt. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for another Voronoi texture and just drop it right down here. And then again, the object is going to go into the vector. And then I can control shift and click on this. Now, I actually want to distort this texture. So I'm going to press shift A and search for a noise texture. And I'll drop the noise texture right here, right in front of this one. And so you can see that the noise texture is going through the vector. And so it's actually going to distort how the Voronoi texture is placed on the object. And you can see that it's clearly taking effect. So I'm going to turn the scale on the noise texture to like a 3.6. And I'll turn the detail all the way up to 16 so it's very detailed. And I'll turn the roughness down just a little bit to like a 0.48. Now, on the Voronoi texture, I want to click on the F1 and I want to change that to distance to edge. And now you can see we have those little cracks and things. Now, I don't want this to be everywhere. I just want it to be some places. So I'm going to control the contrast with a color ramp. So I'll press shift D on this color ramp, just drop the color ramp right down here. And you can see it's already kind of doing what I want. But I want to switch these values so that it's mostly white. And then I'll just drag the black tab way out here so that it's pretty subtle. And then I'll drag the white out a little bit as well. So if you look around here, you can see there's just some little gray areas in little patches. And I'm going to use that to kind of look like chunks coming out of the ground. So I'm going to select this bump node right here, the one in the middle. And I'll press shift D to duplicate it and drop it right in here. So now there are four of them. And then again, I will turn off the invert. So now we can just add this one in. So I'm going to take the color and plug that into the height. And then I can control shift and click on all these to preview them. And then I do want this one to be a bit stronger. So on the strength here, I'm going to turn this up to like a 0.68. So it's quite a bit stronger. And now you can really start to see those. So if I control shift and click on the final material, you can see there's all these little chunks and things coming out of the ground. All right, so let's just do the last layer of detail. I want to add those cracks in the texture. So on this Voronoi texture and this noise texture, I'm just going to shift select both of them. And then I'll press shift D to duplicate them and drop them down here. And then again, the object, I'm going to plug that into the vector. And then I can control shift and click on the Voronoi. Now this one, I want to be a bit smaller because I don't want there to be quite as much cracks. So I'm going to turn the scale down to like a 2.3. And then the scale here on the Voronoi, I'm going to change that to like a 2. Now if we added these into the bump right now, those cracks would be really, really thick. So to make those thinner, I'm going to press shift A and search for another color ramp. We'll just drop the color ramp right here. And then I can just take the white tab and drag that really, really close to the black tab. And you can see that it's going to make it much more contrasty. And it's going to also sharpen up those cracks. So the cracks are just really, really small. All right, now I don't want these cracks to be everywhere. I just want them to be places here and there. So I'm going to make a mask and then use that mask to tell it that it's only going to be some spots here and there. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for another noise texture. Just drop it here. And then once again, I'm going to plug the object up to the vector on the noise texture. And then I think I'll turn the roughness up to like a 0.52 just so that it has a little bit more roughness. And then because this is a mask, we need it to be very contrasty. So once again, I'm going to press shift A and search for a color ramp. We'll just drop the color ramp right here. And then if it wasn't plugged up already, just plug the noise texture factor up to the color ramp. And then you can control shift and click on the color ramp. So now let's actually flip these because I want to flip the values and then just bring them up really, really close. And you can see now we have a nice mask. So just like that, something like that is really good. So now I want to merge these together, kind of mix them together. And we're going to tell it that where the black values are, that's where the cracks are going to be. So I'm going to press shift A and we're going to search for another mix RGB, drop it down here. And then because this is a mask, we're going to plug the color up to the factor and then just unplug it from color 1. And then this one, this one up here with the cracks, we're going to plug that into color 1. And then I can control shift and click on the mix RGB. So color 2 now, that can be fully white. And now you can see that wherever these black areas are, that's where the cracks are going to be. So now we can take this and we can add it into the final material. So where the cracks are, I want to make that darker. So we're going to plug that into the base color. And then also we're going to plug that into the normal. So let's take the bump node and we'll press shift D and add one more bump node right here. And then we can plug the mix right here all the way up to the height. So then I can control shift and click on the final material. And you can see that it's starting to add those cracks in there. Now it's not really strong enough. So I'm going to turn the strength up to like 8.5. So it's halfway. And now you can really start to see those cracks in there. Now to be able to see them even better, we can make the cracks darker. So to do that, I'm going to click on this mix here and I'll press shift D and drop it right down here. And then we can take this mix down here, the mix with the cracks, and we can plug that into the factor of our new mix. And then this mix right here, this is just the normal color. We can take this and plug this into color 2. And then I can control shift and click on this. So now color 1, that's going to be the color of the cracks. So I'm just going to make it a dark brown color. And the hex value that I'm going to use for the cracks is going to be 7C4E2E. So now if you look at this, you can see the cracks are just a little bit darker colored. And then if I control shift and click on the final material, you're able to see those cracks just a little bit better because they are darker. All right, so this is looking really nice. There's just one more thing that I want to do. And that is I want to plug the final color up to the roughness to give it some roughness value. Now you can see that when I just plug that up, it looks really, really shiny. It kind of looks wet and that's not what I want. I want a very dry cracked ground material. So I'm going to press shift A and again, let's add one more color ramp and I'll just drop the color ramp right down here going through the roughness. So now if I take the black tab, if I turn the color up more and more white, it's going to be more and more rough. So you can see when it's fully white, it looks super, super rough. It almost looks like chalky. But when I turn it way down, you can see it's looking more shiny and reflective. So I do want it to be pretty white. I do want it to be a light gray, not fully white, but pretty white because it is a dry dirt ground. All right, and that is it. So that is the finished material. Let's just look at the final thing. That looks really cool. We have a lot of nice detail in there and we also have some little bumps and things that look like pebbles and things like that and some nice little cracks and chunks. So I'll just render this out and we'll take a look. All right, there we go. So there is the finished material. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and thank you so much for watching.

Now, if you'd like to help support this channel as well as purchase the project files, then you can get that over on my Gumroad and my Patreon. The links are in the description. Also, real quick before we start, I wanted to thank Sketchfab for sponsoring this video. On Sketchfab's 3D Model Store, you can purchase models and assets. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can upload and preview your own 3D models in your browser. You can even view your 3D models on a phone or tablet. You can also apply to become a seller on the platform. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. All right, so here is the procedural setup that we're going to be creating. Now, it might look a little bit complicated, but I will walk you through the entire process. And what's really cool about this material is the rocks are actually going to be displaced. So we're going to be using Blender's Adaptive Subdivision to actually displace the rocks and have them bump out of the mesh. So before we actually get started with the procedural setup, I'm just going to show you the setup that I have. So I just pressed Shift-A and I added an Icosphere. And then right behind me on the Add Icosphere settings, I just turned the subdivisions up and then I shaded the object smooth. And then I also wanted to add a plane just so that I could see the material on the plane. So I added a plane and then I subdivided it a bunch of times just so that it has a little bit more detail. And then I'm using the Cycles render engine. So for the lighting, I just added these plane lights. So you can see they're just basic circles. And then I just added an emission material to them. And then also to help us get very realistic lighting, I used an HDRI from polyhaven.com. So if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using, I'll leave the link in the description. And then also the strength, I just set that to 0.8. And then let's also set up the displacement before we get started with the material. So right over here on the Render Properties, you need to make sure that you're in the Cycles render engine. Now you could use Eevee if you want to, but the displacement in the materials isn't going to work. So if you want to use the displacement, then you need to change it to Cycles. And then also on the Feature Set here, make sure this is set to Experimental. All right, and then let's click on New to add a new material. And then once we've added the new material, I'm going to go down here to the Material Properties. And then right down here, if we scroll down, you can see that there are these settings. The displacement, we're going to change this to Displacement and Bump. All right, so now that we have that set up, let's set up the subdivision surface modifier. So I'm going to click right over here on the Modifier Properties, and then just click on the plane here or whatever object you're using. I'm going to click on Add Modifier, and I'm going to add the subdivision surface. Now I want to use the adaptive subdivision, so make sure you checkmark the Adaptive Subdivision. And then the Dicing Scale, this is going to change the amount of detail that it's subdivided. I'm just going to leave it at one for now. And then also, you can see that it kind of smooths out the edges a little bit. Now it is subdivided, but that edge is a bit smoothed out. So from Catmull-Clark, I'm going to change it to Simple, and now you can see the edge is very sharp. So let's click on the sphere now. And again, I'm going to do the same thing, but I'm going to add the subdivision surface modifier with the Adaptive, and then I can just leave that how it is. And then one more thing before we actually set up the materials, I'm going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler add-on turned on, then you can just click right here on Edit, and then click on the Preferences. And then just click right over here on the add-ons, and up on the search here, just start to type in Node, and then you can just checkmark the Node Wrangler add-on. All right, so we're going to be creating three basic materials. We're going to be creating a dirt material, a rock material, and a moss material, and then we'll all be adding them together. So first, let's start by making the dirt material. So I'm actually just going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a frame. And a frame is just a very nice way to organize your nodes. So I'm going to drop the Principled BSDF into the frame. Now, if you click on the frame and press N, that's going to open up the side panel, and you can actually label the frame. So I'm going to change the label to dirt, and then I can just press N to close this panel. So let's press Shift-A, and I'm going to start by adding a noise texture. We'll just drop it into the dirt frame, and then just pull it out. And then I'm also going to press Shift-A, and we're going to search for a texture coordinate. So just add the texture coordinate. We're just going to drop it out here. Now, I want the texture coordinate to be plugging into all of the different materials, so I'm going to leave it out of the dirt frame. So I'm going to plug the object up to the vector, and then using the feature from the Node Wrangler, I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on the node, and that's going to preview it. All right, so we're going to use this noise texture as the color for our dirt. So I'm going to turn the scale down to like a 3, and then I'll turn the detail all the way up to 16, so it's very detailed. So that doesn't really look like dirt right now, because it's just black and white. So let's press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a ColorRamp node. We're going to drop the ColorRamp node right in here, and then we can just tell it what colors we want it to use. So I'm first going to drag the black tab out, and then I'll also drag the white tab closer. And then the white tab, I actually want to make this a gray color, and then right here on the plus, we're going to click on this to add a new tab, and this tab is going to be a brown dirt color. And then this is a little bit contrasty, so I'm going to drag that back a little bit. And then I'll bring this over a bit as well, so there's more brown. All right, so now we can take the color of the ColorRamp and plug that into the Principled BSDF, and then Ctrl-Shift and click on it. And why I'm adding some gray as well is because I want it to look like there are some rocks coming out of the dirt. All right, so I do want to add a lot more detail to that ground, so I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for another noise texture. And then I'm going to plug the object up to the vector, and let's Ctrl-Shift and click on it. And then I'll press Shift-A again, and I'm going to search this time for a Voronoi texture. So I'm just going to drop the Voronoi texture right here, and I'm dropping it in front of the noise texture, and that way the noise texture is going to displace the vector. So it's going to change how the Voronoi texture looks. So if I just Ctrl-Shift and click on the Voronoi texture, you can see now it looks all distorted. Now I want to set this F1 to Smooth F1, and then I'll turn the scale up quite a bit to like 18. And then right back here on the noise texture, let's turn the scale down to like a 4, and then I want to turn up the detail to like a 3. And then the roughness, I'm going to turn this to like a 0.23. And then instead of using the factor on the noise texture, I want to use the color. So I'm going to take the color here and plug that into the vector instead, and now you can see we have a completely different result. So I just want to use some of this texture, but not all of it. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a ColorRamp node. We're just going to drop the ColorRamp node right here, and then we are going to drag these out to make them very contrasty. Now I actually want to flip the white and the black, and that way there's going to be mostly black. And you can see now this is the result that we're getting. So we're just getting these little dots and specks and things like that. All right, so now I'm going to take this voronoi texture, and I'm going to press Shift-D to duplicate it, and we're just going to drop it down here. And then I want the object to be plugging up into the vector. And then let's Control-Shift and click on it to preview the distance. So this is going to be some more details in our texture. This one, I'm going to change the F1 to F2, and you can see now we have a totally different look. And then also I just want to use some parts, but not all of it. So I'm going to take this ColorRamp and I'll press Shift-D, and I'm just going to drop it down here so that we can preview it. And then also it's way too contrasty right now, so let's pull the white tabs and the black tabs out a bit so that we can see more of that texture. And there we go. Once we pull the black tab out, you can really start to see those little bits there. So I want to now mix these two textures together. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a MixRGB node. And then I'm just going to drop the ColorRamp into Color1, and then also this bottom ColorRamp, I'm going to drop that into Color2. So now I can Control-Shift and click on the mix. And then I want to add both of these textures together, so I'm going to change this Mix to Add, and then the Factor here, I'm going to turn that all the way up to 1, and now it's just adding them both together. So let's Control-Shift and click on the Principled BSDF, and then just drag that out so there's a little bit more space. Alright, so I want to use this texture here for the normal, but then I also want to use it in the color. So first, I'm just going to plug the color into the normal, and then if I Control-Shift and click on the Principled BSDF, we need to convert this to normal data. So let's press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a Bump node. Let's just drop the Bump node right here, and then I don't want this to be going into the normal, I want it to be going into height, and then it will convert that to normal data. And now if you zoom in, you can see we're getting a lot of details in that dirt. And then I also want this texture right here to contribute to the color. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a Mix RGB. We're just going to drop the Mix RGB right here, and then this Add, I'm going to plug that as the Factor. So we're going to be using this as a mask for the Factor, and then this Color Ramp here is going to be going into Color 1. So if I Control-Shift and click on it, you can see what's happening. So Color 2 is now going to be the new color. So I'm going to make it a dark brown color, not super saturated, but just a little bit saturated, and now you can see we have some nice details in there. So if I Control-Shift and click on it, there we go. Now I also want this first noise texture to also be contributing to the normal. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for another bump node, and we're just going to drop the second bump node before the first one. So now we can just take the Factor of this noise texture and plug that into the Height, and then this one is just going to be going through here, through the Normal. So now you can see that we have both of those combined. So we have this first one, and then that second one. Now the bump map is a little bit strong right now, so I'm going to turn the Strength down to like a 0.6, so it's not quite as strong, and then also now you're able to see more of those details in the first bump. Alright, so we're almost done with the first dirt material, but I just want to have the color contribute to the roughness. So I'm going to plug the color here up to the roughness on this mix here, and then you can see that when I plug it up, it is pretty shiny. So to control the roughness, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to add a Color Ramp node. We'll just drop the Color Ramp node right in here, and then this black tab, we can turn this color up, and if we turn it up, you can see now it's very, very rough, but then if we turn it down to a darker color, it's going to be more shiny. So really just change it to whatever you want. I'm just going to make it kind of a lighter color, so it's a little bit shiny, but not super shiny. Alright, so just press Ctrl-S to save your project. So this is it for the first dirt material. Now let's do the moss. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and we're going to search for another principled BSDF. Just drop it up here, and then I'll press Shift-A, and again, I'm going to search for a frame, and then let's just drop the principled BSDF into that frame. Now if you click on the frame and press T to open up the properties right here, you can change the label to moss, and then you can just press N to close that panel. So again, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for another noise texture. I'll just drop it into the moss, and then drag it over, and then also on the texture coordinate node, I'm going to plug the object up to the vector, and then I will just Ctrl-Shift and click on it to preview it. Now the detail here, I'm going to turn that all the way up to 16, so it's very detailed, and then I'll turn the roughness value all the way up to 1, so it's very detailed as well. So now let's press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp, because we want to tell it what colors we want in the moss. So I'm going to add the color ramp node, and then we will make all the different colors for the moss. So the first one, I'm just going to leave that as black. Then this second one right here, I'm going to drag this over, and then I'm going to make this one a very dark green, and I'll make it even darker so it's pretty dark. Alright, so I'll click on the plus here to add a new tab. I'm going to drag this one over, and then this one I'm going to make a light green, and not super saturated, not quite that saturated, and a bit brighter. Alright, and then I'll click on the plus again to add a new tab. This one I'm going to drag over here, and then this one I'm going to make a yellowish color. Still a bit green, but much more towards the yellow. And then I do need to make this middle one here a little bit darker, and a little bit less saturated. So that is the look that I'm going for. So let's plug the color into the base color, and then I'll Control-Shift and click on the principled. Alright, so now let's make the normal for the moss. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a musgrave texture. Just drop it down here, and then I want to plug the object into the vector on the musgrave texture. So let's Control-Shift and click on the musgrave texture. Now I want to distort this using a noise texture, so I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a noise texture, and we'll drop it right down here through the vector so that it distorts the musgrave texture. And then we want the color to be going into the vector. So then on the scale here on the noise texture, let's turn that down to like a 3, and I'll turn the detail all the way up to 16 so it's very detailed. And then right over here on the musgrave texture, I'm going to turn the scale up to like a 25 so that there's a lot more scale, and that way you can see a lot more of the musgrave texture, and we're starting to get a cool texture. Let's turn the detail all the way up to 16 again so it's very detailed, and then let's plug the height here up to the normal. So if I Control-Shift and click on this, we need to convert this to normal data. So I'll press Shift-A, and we are going to add another bump node, and we'll just drop the bump node right here, and then again we want to convert this to a normal map. So we're going to plug this into the height, and then that will convert it to normal data, and then it can go into the principal. All right, so I'm just going to press Control-S again, so that is it for our moss material. Now I will go and make the rock material in a moment, but I thought we might as well merge these two materials together, and then after that we'll add the rocks on top. So to join these two shaders together, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a mix shader. We'll just drop it here, and then we can plug the moss onto the top one, and then the dirt we can plug that up to the bottom one. Now you can see that it's kind of just evenly mixing them together, so we need to make a mask to tell it where it's going to be moss, and where it's going to be the dirt. So I'll press Shift-A, and I'm going to add another noise texture, and we can just drag this up and just stick the noise texture right in here, in between the moss and the dirt. And then again, let's take the object coordinates and plug that into the vector, and then we can Control-Shift and click on the noise texture to preview it. So the scale, I want to turn that down to like a 1, so it's not quite as big, and then I'll turn the detail up to like a 5.5. And then the roughness, I'll turn that up to like a 0.59, so there's just a little bit more roughness. So now we need to make this a lot more contrasty, and then use this as the factor. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and we're going to add another color ramp. We'll just drop that right in there, and then if we drag these two values together, it's going to be more and more contrasty. So I'm just going to go with something like that. I think that looks pretty good. So now let's take the color and plug that into the factor on the mix shader, and then I can Control-Shift and click on that to preview it. So you can see now most of it is dirt, but then there's just a little bit of that moss here and there. And you can of course adjust the scale of this if you want there to be more little patches, and you can adjust this so if you want their moss to be more all over the place, you can drag that out. Or if you want to be a bit more subtle, then you can kind of drag that down. All right, so there we go. We have the moss and the dirt. So now up here we're going to make the rocks, and then we're going to add those to the final material, and then we'll also add the displacement. So I'm going to press Shift-A. Let's add another principled BSDF, and then I'll also press Shift-A, and we're also going to add another frame. And then on the principled here, I'll drop this into the frame, and then let's click on the frame, and again I'll press N to open the side panel. And on the label here, I'm going to call it rocks, just like that, and then press N to close that panel. All right, so now let's create our rock material. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and then once again I'm going to add the noise texture. We'll just drop the noise texture right here and bring it out, and then right here on the texture coordinate, the object, I'm going to plug that into the vector on the noise texture. And then let's Control-Shift and click on it to preview it. So I'm going to turn the scale down to like a 1, so it's a lot bigger, and then the detail, I'm going to turn that to 0, and the roughness, I'm going to turn this to 0 as well, because I don't want very many details, because this is going to be telling it where the rocks are going to be. Now let's also press Shift-A, and I'm going to add a Voronoi texture again, and I'll drop this right in here so that the noise texture distorts the Voronoi. And then also I'll plug the color up to the vector. And then let's turn the scale down to something like a 3, and then I need to Control-Shift and click on it so that we can preview the distance value. Now the scale, I'm going to turn that down to like a 3, and then the randomness, I'm going to actually turn that all the way to 0, so that it's not quite as wobbly, and that will be better for our rocks. So now I want to use a color ramp to just make it more contrasty, so that there are only rocks certain places. So I'll press Shift-A, let's add another color ramp, and drop that in there. And then I do want to switch these, so I'll bring the black tab out a bit, and then the white tab, and then I want to drag these very close together, and you can see this is going to be the mask for where the rocks are. So that's looking really good, just looks like some random rocks, but I want to have more rocks, and I also want to have some of the rocks be a bit smaller, and a little bit different variation. So to do that, I'm going to click on the noise texture, and then Shift-click on the Voronoi, and the color ramp. I'm now going to press Shift-D to duplicate this, and just drop this right up here. And then also again, I want to plug the object of the texture coordinate up to the noise texture, just like that. So now this one and this one are the exact same thing, so to make this a little bit different, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a mapping node, and I'll drop the mapping node right here. And then what we can do is we can just play around with the scale value, and that's going to make the rock smaller, and then also change the position. So on the scale here, I'm going to click, drag down, and then let go, and that way we can change all the values at the same time. So I'm going to change this to a 1.5, and now you can see, if you Control-Shift and click on this, that these rocks are smaller, and they're placed at a different spot. So you can see these are bigger, and then these are smaller. So now we have a bunch more rocks, and I want to mix these two types of rocks together. So to mix them together, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a MixRGB, and we'll just drop this right down here. And then let's just change it to Add, so that we can add both of them together. And then the bottom color ramp, let's plug the color up to color 2, and then the top color ramp is going to be going into color 1. So now we can just turn the factor all the way up to 1, and you can see now it's merging both of those two rock masks together. So we have a lot more rocks now. All right, so we can now use this for a few different things. We can use it for the color, and we can also use it for the normal. So first, I'm going to plug the color into the normal, and then we need to convert it to normal data again. So I'm going to press Shift-A and search again for a bump node. We'll just drop that right in there, and then we need to plug this up to the height. And then if I Control-Shift and click on the principled, you can see now it looks like those rocks are popping out. And then let's also plug the color up to the base color, but you can see that doesn't look very good. That's not really what we want. So let's press Shift-A and search for another color ramp. We'll drop the color ramp right here, and now we can make it the different rock colors that we want. So this is actually going to be pretty simple. Most rocks are just pretty gray colored, so I'm going to make this one a gray color, and this one's going to be a little bit more of a lighter gray. So if I Control-Shift and click on it, you can see what that looks like. And then this black one here, that's going to be a gray color as well, but this one's going to be slightly darker. So if I Control-Shift and click on this, now you can see that the rocks are a little bit lighter, and then the rest of it is a little bit darker. All right, now this really doesn't look like a rock material, and that's because we need to add a lot more bump to it. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for another noise texture. We can just drop it right down here, put it inside the frame, and then just put it underneath the other textures. And then again, we want to take the object from the texture coordinate and plug that into the vector. So I can now Control-Shift and click on this one to preview it. So for this one, I'm going to change the scale to like a 0.4, so that it's pretty big, and then I'll turn the detail all the way up to 16, so it's very detailed. And then the roughness, I think I'll turn that up to like a 0.6, just that it has, again, a little bit more roughness. All right, so now we can use this data as our bump. So I'm going to take the bump node right here and press Shift-D and drop it over here, and then this bump node can just be going through the normal. And now we have this height here to plug the noise texture into. So the factor, I'm going to plug that into the height on this second bump here. And now if I Control-Shift and click on it, you can see we have all that bump there from that noise. So if I now Control-Shift and click on this, you can see now that looks a lot more like a rock material. And then the last thing that I need to do to complete this material is I need to plug the color up to the roughness, because I want to play around with the roughness value. Now on default, it's actually kind of shiny, and rocks usually aren't that shiny unless they're kind of wet. I'm going to press Shift-A and search again for a color ramp node. Just drop it right down here before it goes into the roughness input. And then we can just take the black tab, take that color, and turn it up. So if you turn it up really high, it's going to be very, very rough. But then if you turn it down, it's going to be more shiny. So just something like that is pretty good. All right, so now we have our rocks. And then if I Control-Shift and click on the mix shader, we also have our dirt with our moss. So now we can mix these all together, and then also add the displacement. So first I'm going to mix this together. So I'm going to take the mix shader right here, and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it, and drop it right up here. And then I can also bring the material output right up here and Control-Shift and click on this. So we're going to take this mix shader, and we're going to put that in the bottom one. And then the rocks right here, we're going to put that into the top one. So now you can see it's just evenly blending them together, but I only want the rock material to appear where the rocks are. So to fix that, if I Control-Shift and click on this add, you can see that we already have a mask made for us. So I'm just going to take the color of that and plug it all the way down here into the factor. So now if I Control-Shift and click on this, you can see it's working, but it's actually flipped the opposite direction. And to fix this, I'm just going to press Shift-A and add a color ramp. We'll just drop the color ramp right in here, and then I want to flip these, and that way it's going to kind of invert it. So I'm just going to flip these, and now you can see most of the material is actually that dirt and moss, and then the rocks are just where the rocks are popping out. So now we can also make this sharper. So if I Control-Shift and click on this, you can see that this mask is a little bit smooth on the edges, and I don't want that. I want to make it very, very sharp. So I'm going to drag the black tab way out, and then also bring the white tab out a little bit as well, and that way now you can see it's really, really sharp. So if I Control-Shift and click on this, you can see we're clearly telling it where it's going to be rock and where it's going to be dirt. All right, so that is good. So now we just need to make the rocks actually be displaced out of the mesh. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a displacement node. I'm just going to drop the displacement node right down here, and then we can plug the displacement value up to the displacement on the material output. So now we just need a mask to tell it where it's going to be displaced. Now we already have this color ramp, but if we use this one, it's going to be way too contrasty, and so it's not going to be like a smooth rock. It's going to be super sharp. So I'm actually going to use the add here on these rocks. So this one right here, it's the same thing, but it's just a little bit more smooth. So I'm going to plug the color all the way down over here onto the height of the displacement. So now that we've plugged that up, you can see it's starting to do something. Let's Control-Shift and click on the final material, and you can see what it looks like. So it definitely is popping the rocks out, but the mid-level, I'm going to turn that to zero. And then also the scale here, it's way too strong, so I'll turn the scale down to like a 0.1. And that might be just a little bit too strong still, so I'm going to turn that down to like a 0.08. And there we go. So now if I just zoom over to this, you can see that it's actually displacing the mesh and popping out those rocks. And because we turned on the adaptive subdivision, it's going to add more detail to where we are. So if we zoom up here, you can see this rock might look a little bit low quality. If you just double tap the tab key, that's going to update it, and you can see now that rock is a lot more detailed. And there we go. So you can just look around, and you can see that all those different rocks are actually being displaced and popping out of the mesh. All right, and that is it. So that is the finished material. So I'll just render this out, and we'll take a look. All right, so that is it. That is the finished result for this procedural rocky ground material.

Now if you'd like to help support the channel and also purchase the project files for this tutorial then you can do that over on my Gumroad store and also my Patreons over on my Patreon page will be getting the project files. So links in the description if you'd like to check that out. So here's the procedural setup that we're going to be creating. As you can see it's actually not that complicated but it has a great result. Now real quick before we continue I want to thank this video's sponsor Sketchfab. On Sketchfab's 3D model store you can purchase models and assets. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can upload and preview your own 3D models in your browser. You can even view your 3D models on a phone or tablet. You can also apply to become a seller on the platform. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. Alright so I just wanted to show you the setup that I have before we start the tutorial. So I just added an icosphere and then I added the subdivision surface modifier on it so that it's very smooth and then I also shaded it smooth. And then I also added a camera and I pointed the camera right at the sphere. And then I am using the Cycles render engine so I just added this plane right here and then I added an emission material for our light. If you're using the Eevee render engine you could also just press shift A and just add a regular area light. And then also to get some very realistic lighting in the world right here I added this empty warehouse 01 1k HDR and this is from polyhaven.com so I'll leave a link in the description if you'd like to use the same HDRI that I'm using. So right here on the world I just clicked on the color right here and changed it to environment texture and then I opened up the HDRI. And then I'm also going to be using the node wrangler addon to preview our shader nodes so if you don't have that enabled you can click on edit and then click on the preferences. And then right over here on the addons you're just going to type in node right here on the search and you can see that there's this node wrangler addon so just check mark that addon and I will show you how to use it in the tutorial. All right we can just close the user preferences. All right so I have the shader editor pulled up right here so I'm just going to click on new to add a new material and we can just call this procedural wood. All right so I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to start off by adding a Verona texture. We're just going to drop it down here and then I can use the feature from the node wrangler by holding down the control and shift key and clicking on the node that's going to add the viewer node and it's going to preview the Verona texture. Now the scale right here I'm going to turn this up to a six so that it has a little bit more detail and then also using another feature from the node wrangler I'm going to with the Verona texture selected press ctrl T and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping and then I want to use the object mapping so I'm going to place the object into the mapping and that way it'll just place the Verona texture around the object more evenly. All right so this really doesn't look anything like wood and so what I want to do is actually add another texture in here through the vector to distort the Verona texture because the vector right here this is telling the texture how it's going to be placed on the object so I can press shift A and I can search for a noise texture and I'm just going to drop the noise texture right in here and that way the noise texture is going to affect the vector and so it's going to distort the Verona texture and then also something that's very important make sure you plug the factor into the vector because later on when we work with the colors that is really going to affect what it looks like. All right so on the noise texture I'm going to change the scale to 2 and then the detail I'm going to turn that all the way up to 16 so it's very detailed then on the roughness here I'm going to change this to 0.8 so it has even more detail and then the distortion here I'm going to turn this up to 4 and the distortion really helps to make it look like the grain of wood. Now this is a pretty good black and white texture of the grains of wood but it isn't very stretched and with wood usually the grains of wood look a bit stretched so to stretch it I'm going to use the mapping right here to do that so right down here on the scale the y value of the scale I'm going to turn this up to like a 10 and you can see now that looks a lot like wood you can see that nice texture there it's all being stretched and it looks a lot like wood so now we can go ahead and add the colors that we want for the wood so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp and I'll just drop the color ramp right in here and then we can make all the different colors that we want so first I'm going to drag the black tab out and then also this white tab I'm going to drag this out as well I'm just going to drag it out to about here and then on the color of the white I don't want it to be white I'm going to make it a dark brown color and if you want to use the same dark brown color that I'm using I'm going to be using a hex value of 704024 so you can punch that in if you want to use the exact same color that I'm using then I will click on the plus here to make a new one I'm going to drag this one over here and then this one I'm going to change it to a very light brown and again if you want to use the same hex value that I'm using for the light brown the hex value is bf915b then I'm going to click on the plus here to add another one I'm going to drag this one over pretty close to the light brown one and this one I'm going to make very very light brown so it's going to be almost a pure white but it is going to be going a little bit towards the orange colors and again the hex value that I'm using is ffe4cf so now you can see that really is starting to look like wood it has some parts that are darker and some parts that are lighter and then here and there it also has some little white patches all right so now we can plug the color into the base color and then I can control shift and click on the principle to preview it all right so that is it for the color but I also want to give it some roughness and I also want to give it some bump so first let's just take the color and put that into the roughness value now I'm going to press shift a and search for another color ramp because I want to control how shiny it is because you can see this looks like a super polished wood and if you want that you could leave it like that I do want it to be a shiny wood but not quite that shiny so this black tab right here I'm going to turn it up and you can see when I make it more and more light colored it's going to be more and more rough so this is a very rough wood but then if I turn it down it's very bright so I'm just going to change it to something about in the middle kind of just a gray color in the middle I think that looks pretty good all right so now we want this to affect the normal so what we can do is we can take the distance and just plug that into the normal and then I'm going to press shift a and just search for a bump node because we need to convert this to normal data because this is a gray value so we want to plug the distance into the height and then the normal into the normal now that kind of works but if I control shift and click on this you can see that this value right here this distance value on the texture it has so much detail that when you zoom in here you can see it's super super rough and even with the strength turned up to one you can see it's not popping out that much it's almost like there's too much detail and if I control shift and click on this you can see it's very very fine detail and it kind of gets rid of our shininess as well because it's so rough so what I want to do is use this same texture but not have as much detail so to do that I'm going to click on the Voronoi and then shift click on the noise texture I'll press shift d to duplicate them and drop them down here and then I also want to plug the vector of the mapping right here up to the vector of the noise texture so now the Voronoi texture right here and the Voronoi texture right here are exactly the same but now we can just turn down the amount of detail so right here on the noise texture the roughness value I'm going to turn this down to like a 0.4 and now if I zoom way in you can see that's way less detailed you can see how much detail there is right there now if I control shift and click on this you can see that has tons more detail whereas this has a lot less so now I'm going to use that for our bump instead of the super detailed one so I'm just going to take the distance plug that into the height of the bump and then I can control shift and click on this and you can see now that normal that bump there is popping out a lot more and you can see it's actually really really strong so if I control shift and click on this you can see that's like bumping out a lot and that's almost too much so I'm going to turn the strength value right here down to like a 0.1 so you can see now if I zoom in you can really see those grains of wood they're kind of popping out but if you use this distance it has too much detail so it's really really small but this distance it has less detail and you can see that those grains of wood really pop out so that looks a lot better and of course you can change the strength so if you want to make it bump out a bit more you can I'm just going to set it to 0.1 I think that looks pretty good all right and that is it that is the procedural wood texture so I'm just going to render this out and we'll take a look all right there we go so that is it that is the procedural wood material so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial I hope it was helpful

And also my Patreons on my Patreon page will be getting the project files, so if you'd like to check out my Patreon, the link will be in the description.

You can even view them in AR, VR, or on a phone or tablet. You can also purchase 3D models and assets from Sketchfab's model store. You can even apply to sell your own models on the platform. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. Alright so here is the procedural material that we're going to be creating. Now it may look a little bit complex, but I will walk you through the entire process. Now I did want to show you the setup that I have before we start. So I just pressed shift A and I added an icosphere right here. And then right behind me when you add the icosphere, there's those icosphere settings. I just turned these subdivisions up pretty high to like a 6, and then I shaded the object smooth. Then I also added a camera and I pointed the camera right at the sphere. And then also because this is a wood flooring, I thought it would be cool to kind of see it flat, like if it would be on the ground. So I just added a plane right here in the background, just so that we can see it flat. And then I'm using the cycles render engine. So I just added these two plane lights. So they're just basic planes. And then I added an emission material to them. If you're using Eevee, you could just use like an area light or something like that. And then also to help us get very realistic lighting, I added in this empty warehouse 011k HDR. And this is from polyhaven.com. So I'll leave a link in the description if you'd like to download the same one that I'm using. And I just added this in as an environment texture and opened it up. And then the strength here, I just set it to 0.7 because we do have these plane lights. And they help to give kind of a little bit of a rim light on the sphere. So I want to turn the strength down just a little bit. And then right over here on the render properties, I did go over here to the color management and I set this to filmic. And then I turned the look to high contrast, just so that we get a little more realistic lighting. And then one last thing before we start, I am going to be using the node wrangler add-on. So if you don't have that enabled, you can go right here to edit and then go to the preferences. And then right over here on the add-ons, just type in node here on the search. And then just turn on the node wrangler add-on. I'll show you how to use this. It's a very useful add-on when using the procedural nodes. All right, so with that all out of the way, let's get started. So I'm going to go into a rendered mode right here. And then right over here, I am in the shader editor. So I'm going to click on new and I can just call this like wood flooring. And then I've added this to the plane. I also want it to be on here. So I'm going to click on this one, click on the dropdown and I'm going to add the wood flooring. All right, so to begin, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for the brick texture. And then also with the brick texture selected, I'm going to press control T. And that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And that's using a feature from the node wrangler. And then I want to plug the object into the vector. And the object mapping does a better job of placing the texture on the object. And then using another feature from the node wrangler, I can hold down the control and shift key and click on the node to preview it. And then this might be happening for you. And because we added in ecosphere, it's kind of like rotated it over so you can see it up here. Now you probably would just be using this on a plane, but just for the tutorial sake, I want to use a sphere as well. So what I did for this is I just pressed R to rotate X on the X axis. And then I typed in nine zero and enter just to rotate it over. All right, let's zoom into the brick texture. And I'm going to turn the scale up to like a seven. And then the mortar size, that's like a little bit in between. I'm going to turn this way down to like a point zero zero five. And you can see now the mortar, the stuff in between there is very small. And then the mortar smooth. This is how smooth that's going to be that transition. Right now it's at point one. I want to change it to one. And you can see now it's very smooth. Now let's go right up here to the color one and color two. So color one, I actually want to be a little bit more gray. And then color two, I actually want to make that a little bit lighter. And then we can also change this bias if that's how you pronounce it. But when you change this, you can see that it's going to change between color one and color two. So you can see when I turn it up, it's going to all become color two. But when I turn it all down, it's going to become color one. I want there to be a lot of contrast. So I'm just going to turn it to a value where I can kind of see both of them. So I think maybe like a point zero two does look pretty good. And then let's also change the brick width. So I'm going to turn the brick width to like a four. And then I'll turn the height to like a point six. And there we go. That looks a lot better. All right. Now I want this to be contributing to the normal or the bump because I want the edges here, like the little black parts to just be going in a little bit. So I'm going to take the color and plug that into the normal. And then I need to convert this to a normal data because if I go into rendered mode, that is not working. And that's because this is color, which is yellow. And this is purple, which is normal. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to add a bump node. And that way it'll convert it over. So we're going to drop the bump node right in here. So the color actually needs to go into the height. And then the bump normal will go into the normal. And if I zoom close in there, you can see that now there's that little bump there. And that looks really great. All right. So now I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a noise texture. We're going to use the noise texture to start to get the texture for our wood. And then we'll combine these together. So I'm just going to add the noise texture right here. And then also press control T to add the texture coordinate and mapping. And right here, I want to plug the object into the vector. Now, why I'm not using these ones is because I actually want to stretch it a bit to make it look more like wood. So I'm using a different mapping for the noise texture. So let's control shift and click on this to preview it. And I'm going to turn the scale up to maybe like a 6. And then I'll turn the detail here all the way up to 16. So it's very detailed. And then I'll turn the roughness up to like a 0.8. So it has even more detail in there. And then the distortion value, I'm going to turn this up to something like a 4. And you can see it sort of looks like wood. Not really. The colors need to be changed. But one thing that we can do to make it look a lot more like wood is we can actually stretch it out. So to do that, right here on the scale, the Y value, I'm going to set this to a 10. And you can see that it's going to stretch it out back and forth. And if I zoom in here, that is starting to look a lot more like wood. So now I want to combine the brick texture and the noise texture. And then we can also change the colors. So I'm going to press shift A. I'm going to search for a mix RGB so that we can bind these two together. So I'm going to plug the color of the brick texture up to color 2. And then I will plug the factor of the noise texture up to color 1. And then let's control shift and click on the mix so that we can actually see what it's doing. So right now, it's just evenly mixing them together. But I don't want to do that. I want to multiply it so that we can just add on top of it. And then the factor, I'm going to turn that all the way to 1. And now you can see that it's basically just taking the brick texture and adding it to the noise texture. So it's just combining them together. And that is what we want. So that is really starting to look like wood flooring. But it's just black and white. And so we want to change the colors. So to change the colors, I'm going to press shift A. And I'm going to search for a color ramp. I'll just drop it right down here. And now we can make all the colors that we want right in here. So this white tab, I'm going to bring it really, really close. And then I'm going to make it a dark brown color. And you could also make it slightly on the red side. I do think that looks nice. So I do want it to be brown. But it could just be slightly more of a reddish brown. And then let's click on this plus right here to add a new tab. I'm going to bring this tab over. And then this one, I want it to be kind of like a light brown, a little bit less saturated, and a lot brighter. And it's almost going to be kind of a pinky, slightly pinky, kind of a tannish color. And then I'm going to click on the plus again, move this one over. And this one, I want to be a very, very light color. So it is going to be kind of tannish, kind of pinkish. But it's going to be very, very light. All right. So now let's take the color of this. And we're going to put it into the base color. And then I'm going to control shift and click on the principled BSDF. And you can see that is starting to look really nice. Let's turn the roughness down a little bit. We will be playing around with the roughness value later. But I thought I'd just make it a bit more shiny. And that is already starting to look a lot like wood flooring. Now, I want to add some darker areas. Because I found with wood flooring, there usually is some wood that's a bit darker. So to create these little dark patches, I'm going to press shift A. And I'm going to search for a Verona texture. And I'll just drop it right here. And then the scale, I'm going to turn this up to like a six. And then I'm also going to control shift and click to preview it. Now, again, I want this to be stretched out kind of sideways. So I'm going to take the vector and plug it up to the vector on the Verona texture. And you can see that is now stretched. Kind of looks like wood a little bit. But I want to add a lot more detail to it and make it look more like the grain of wood. So what I'm going to do is actually click on this noise texture. And I'm going to press shift D. And I'm going to drop it right down here. So it's going to actually affect the vector. So the vector is basically how the texture is going to be placed on the object. And so I can use the randomness of this noise texture to actually affect the vector of the Verona. And now you can see that is really, really looking like wood. If I zoom in here, you can see that looks a lot like wood. So now what I want to do is use this to make a mask so that some areas are darker. And then we'll add it to the color. So I'm going to press shift A. And we'll add another color ramp node. I'm just going to drop it right down here. And then just control shift and click on it. So what I want to do is just drag these out and make it very, very contrasty. But I don't want this to be all over the place. Because this is like very, very dark. And there's lots of different areas. I just want it to be in some small areas. So what I'm going to do is use another texture to just tell it that it's going to be in some smaller areas. So I'm going to press shift A. And I'm going to add another noise texture. Drop it right here. And then again, I want this stretched mapping, kind of stretching to the side, to be plugged into the vector. Now let's control shift and click on this noise texture. And I want to turn the scale up to like a 15. And then the detail, I'll turn that all the way up to 16. So it's very detailed. I'm also going to turn the roughness up to like a 0.65. And then I need to make this more contrasty as well, just to tell it where this part is going to be. So I'm going to press shift A. And I'm going to search for another color ramp. I'll just drop it down here. And then again, I'm going to make these very, very contrasty. Although what I'm going to do is pop it over so that the white is actually on this side. And that is the look that I'm going for. So you can see that there's just some little patches where it's black, but then most of it is white. So now I'm going to combine these together by using a mix RGB. So I'm going to press shift A, search for a mix RGB. We'll just drop it right down here. And then because I only want this to show where this is, I'm going to use this as the factor. So I'm going to plug the color ramp up to the factor. And then this color ramp here, I'm going to put it into color one. And then I can control shift and click on it. So you can see now something is weird because it's kind of like black, white, and gray. So what we need to do is just take color two and make that fully white. And now you can see that those black areas are there, but they're a lot less. So now we can combine this with this color right here. So I'm going to press shift A. We're going to search for another mix RGB, and we'll just drop it right here. So now we're going to use this as the mask into this mix right here. So I'm going to put it right in here. And then this color ramp is going to be into color one. So let's control shift and click on this. So what we're going to do is use this mix as the factor. So we're going to plug the color, put that into the factor. And then this color ramp here, that's going to be going into color two. So I can now control shift and click on it. And you can see now it's using this basically as a mask to just add those little dark patches in. Now color one, that is what the darker patches is going to be. So color one, I don't want it to be white. I want it to be like a very, very dark brown color. And if you want to use the same hex value that I'm using, you can just pause the video and just type that into your hex value. And there we go. So if I zoom out now, you can see there's all these little dark patches. Now I think this might be scaled a little bit too small. So right over here on the noise texture, I could scale this down to maybe like a four. Also, you could scale this one down, maybe scale this to like a 10. Now I do think I want these dark patches to be a little bit more subtle. So right up here on this top color ramp here, we can just take the black value and pull it a little bit away, not the white value, but the black value. And if I just start to pull it a little bit away, you can see now it's getting more and more subtle. All right, so we are almost done with this material. But I do want the color to affect the normal a little bit, just so that there's a little bit of bumps where the grain of the wood is. And then I also want it to affect the roughness. So first, I'm going to plug the mix here into the roughness value. And then I want to be able to control it, because right now it's like super, super shiny. So I'm going to press shift A, we're going to search for a color ramp. I'm just going to drop the color ramp right here. Now to change the roughness, I can just click on the black value and I can turn it up. And you can see if I turn it all the way to white, it's very, very rough. But then if I turn it down, it's going to get more and more shiny. So just turn it to something that looks good. I do want it to be pretty shiny. So I'm just going to turn it to like a gray color, something like this. But wood flooring usually is pretty shiny. All right, and then the last thing that I'm going to do is mix this with the normal. So the bump here, I'm going to press shift D and drop it right down here. And then let's plug the color. And we're going to put that into the height. So the normal of this bump is just going through. And then we can plug the mix here of this color up to the height. And that way we can add two bump maps together. Then if I control shift and click on this, you can see now it's adding that wood there. But if I zoom in here, you can see this is way too rough. I want to do two things. I want to make it so that only some areas are kind of bumpy. And then I also want to turn the strength down. So I'm going to press shift A. And I'm going to search for another color ramp. And I'm just going to drop it here. Maybe just move this one out of the way here so we have a little bit more room. So now what I'm going to do is pull this black tab out a little bit. And then this white tab, I can drag it really, really close. And you can now see what it's doing. So basically what it's doing, because we're dragging this really close, you can see some pieces are a bit more smooth, whereas others are a bit more rough. And you can also play around with this. I think I'll bring the black value out a little bit. So you can see that looks a lot better. So some parts are more smooth, where some of them are more rough. But there's not like a ton of roughness everywhere. So I think that looks quite a bit better. Something like that, especially you can see right there, that is kind of the look that I'm going for. So that is good. But if I control shift and click on the final thing, you can see it is still pretty rough. So on the strength here, I'm going to turn this way down to like a 0.05 and enter. So now it's very, very subtle, but it's still there. So if you kind of zoom into where the reflections are, you can see it a bit better. And you can also play around with the color ramp now that it's more subtle. You can change this if you want to be able to see it a little bit better. You could also turn the strength up. I might turn this up to like a 0.1, just so that you can see it a little bit better. All right. And that is it. So that is the procedural wood flooring material. So I'm just going to render this out. And we'll check out the final thing. All right. So that is it. That is the procedural wood flooring material. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial. And thank you for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4zValFjW_Q,Procedural Ore Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor demonstrates how to create a procedural ore material with two main features: mesh displacement and customizable ore types. Using the displacement modifier, they show how to make chunks of ore, like gold, diamond, emerald, ruby, and iron, appear to protrude from a rock surface. The tutorial covers setting up the 3D scene, using various Blender nodes to develop the ore material, and creating a custom node for easy ore type selection. The instructor also mentions that project files are available for purchase on Gumroad or via Patreon, and thanks the video sponsor, Sketchfab.","Hey everyone, welcome to another Blender tutorial. In this tutorial we're going to be creating this procedural ore material in Blender. And there's two really cool features about this procedural ore. The first thing is that we're actually going to be displacing the mesh. So you can see right here there's like these gold chunks coming out of the rock in the ore and you can see that we're going to be using the displacement modifier to actually displace the mesh so that those chunks of gold or the chunks of ore actually come out of the mesh. So you can see in solid view this is just a simple sphere and then these are just some basic rocks and I will show you how I made these rocks if you'd like to create your own ore chunks. But you can see they're actually kind of smooth they don't have that much detail but then when you go into a rendered mode you can see that they actually pop out of the mesh. The other really cool thing about this procedural ore is that you can actually change the type of ore. So you can see right here I created my own custom node and you can see it says ore type. You can see here's gold you can also do a diamond I'll show you how to make all these. So there's diamond there's emerald that's pretty cool and there's also ruby there we go nice and bright red and then there's also iron ore. So I think the iron one actually looks really cool like these big chunks of iron coming out of the rock and you can create any color of ore that you want. I just created these ones here so gold diamond emerald ruby and iron and this is really cool as well especially for all the Minecraft fans out there. You know diamond ore and iron ore things like that so I really like how this looks. This is almost like one of those super realistic Minecraft texture packs you know. And if you'd like to purchase these project files you can purchase them on my Gumroad store the link will be in the description and also if you join my Patreon then you can get the project files as well and by purchasing the project files either on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page you'll be helping to support the channel. And then one last thing before we get started I wanted to thank this video's sponsor Sketchfab. On Sketchfab you can upload your own 3D models and preview them in your browser. You can even view them in AR, VR, or on a phone or tablet. You can also purchase 3D models and assets from Sketchfab's model store. You can even apply to sell your own models on the platform. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. Alright now before we get started with the procedural setup I wanted to show you the setup that I have here in the 3D space. So what I did is I just pressed shift A and I added an icosphere and then right down here on the icosphere settings I just clicked on the subdivisions and I turned that up to like a 6 and then I scaled it up and then I also shaded the object smooth and then I just added a camera and I just pointed the camera right at the sphere. Then to get some very realistic lighting over here in the world I added in the Machineshop 021K HDRI and this is on polyhaven.com so I'll leave the link in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. So right over here on the world I just clicked on this and then chose an environment texture and then I just opened up the HDRI and then I also set the strength to 0.8. And then I also added this plane light right here and I just set it to an emission material with a white color and then the strength to 30. And that way we just have some nice lighting for our procedural material. And then I'm going to go right over here to edit and then open up the preferences. And then just click over here on the add-ons and there's two add-ons that I want to turn on. I want to turn on the Node Wrangler add-on because the Node Wrangler add-on is very useful for working with our procedural nodes so if you don't have that enabled already you can just click right over here on the search and then start to type in node and then you can add the Node Wrangler add-on so just check mark it right there. And then also if you want to create some rock shaped ore like I showed you at the beginning of the video you can just click right here and I'm going to start to type in mesh. And you can see right here there is this add mesh extra objects. I'm just going to turn this on and within this add mesh extra objects there is a rock generator and we're going to use it to generate some rocks for our ore. So that's totally optional if you want to turn that on you can do that. So we can just close the user preferences now. All right so over here on the camera settings I'm just going to bring this down kind of make it smaller here on the resolution just so that we have a little bit more space. And then I'm just going to use Blender's rock generator which we just turned on to add a rock shaped ore of course this is totally optional you don't need to use it you can use whatever object you want. So I'm just going to press shift a and then right down here on mesh you can see that there are these extra objects and I'm going to click right over here on the rock generator. Now right here behind me there's the add rocks there's a lot of different settings here you can also choose like the number of rocks. What I'm going to do is just turn it up to three so that I have three random rocks and then I'm just going to close this and I'll just leave everything else at the default. So I can just drag these over and then I can just kind of move them over and kind of scale them up. So this is really great Blender just automatically adds some rocks for us and then we can also tab into edit mode and we can like select some faces and kind of scale them around if we don't quite like the shape. So these do seem a little bit stretched so I might want to like push some of these down a little bit but really you can just make whatever rock you want. And then if you click right over here on the modifiers on these rocks we want to apply all the modifiers. So I'm just going to select this and then press ctrl-a and then ctrl-a and ctrl-a and just keep on pressing ctrl-a until all of the modifiers have been applied. So I'm just going to click on this one here and then click on this modifier and then we'll just press ctrl-a a bunch of times to apply it and then this one here just press ctrl-a until they are all applied. All right so now that I have these rocks I'm just going to like scale them up and rotate them. So for the final result of the tutorial I just had like three of them kind of like a bigger chunk maybe just rotate this around. So I just had like two smaller chunks and then one bigger chunk. Again you can do whatever you like but I'm going to do something like this. All right so I'm going to click on the sphere right here and then I'm going to click on new and then right here I can just call this procedural or I'm just going to call it procedural or and then I want these objects to all have the same material. So what I can do is I can just drop the material on by just clicking and dragging and just dropping it onto these objects so they all have the same material. All right so now let's set up the displacement before we really get into this material setup. So to set up the displacement we need to do a few things. First of all right here on the feature set we need to change this to experimental and this is right over here on the render property. So set it to experimental then what we need to do is we need to click down here on the material and because these are all the same material it'll work for all of them. So let's just scroll down here and then right here on the surface right now the displacement says bump only we want to change this to displacement and bump. And then the last thing that we need to do is just add the subdivision surface modifier and then use the displacement. So just click right over here on the modifiers and then I'm going to click on add modifier and we can just add the subdivision surface modifier. And then make sure this adaptive subdivision is turned on because that is really important. What that's going to do is it's going to add more geometry and it's going to add more detail where you're looking at the object. So if I zoom in here it's going to add a lot more geometry here and a lot more detail with the subdivision but then kind of over here where you can't really see it it'll be less topology it'll be less detailed. And then there also is this dicing scale. Now you can play around with the dicing scale later if you want but basically if you make this number smaller there's going to be more detail and more subdivision. At the same time though it will be harder to process the more detail that there is. So if you change it up to like a 10 then it's going to be easier for a computer to process but it also won't be quite as detailed. But if you turn this down to like a 0.1 it's going to be super super detailed. That's probably going to be way too high detail. So for this scene I'm just going to start with like a 5. I think 5 is pretty good. So now I want this subdivision surface modifier to be on the other objects as well. So I'm just going to shift select all of the objects and then lastly shift select this object which has the subdivision. Then I can press ctrl l and what we want to do is we want to copy the modifier. So click on that and now if you click on these you can see that they all have the same modifier. Now for some reason it didn't actually add the adaptive subdivision so just click on it to turn it on and then just click on it and click on it and again for some reason the dicing scale you need to change that. So I'm just going to click on this big one here change it to like a 5. Now these two smaller ones we're not actually going to need that much detail because if you tap in edit mode they are actually pretty high detail already. So for the dicing scale on these ones I'm just going to maybe make them like an 8. All right let's finally get started with the procedural material. So the first thing that I'm going to do is just make a basic rock material. So we'll press shift a and I'm going to start by adding a noise texture and then let's also press ctrl t that's using a feature from the node wrangler and that's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping. Now I don't actually need the mapping so I'm going to press ctrl x and that'll get rid of the mapping but keep it plugged up and then I actually just want to plug the object up to the vector. All right so using another feature from the node wrangler I can hold down the ctrl and shift key and click on the node and that is going to preview it. So I'm going to turn this detail right here all the way up to 16 so it's very detailed and then you could also turn the scale up if you want to I'm actually just going to leave it at 5. I think that looks pretty good. So those aren't really rock colors so I want to make some rock colors so to do that I'm going to press shift a I'm going to click on the search and I'm going to add a color ramp node. We're just going to drop it right here and now we can make different rock colors in between here. So this white one right here I'm actually going to pull this one out a little bit and then I'm going to make it a light gray and I also will just make it slightly brown very subtle but slightly brown. Then I'm also going to pull the black one out and then I'll click on the plus here to add another one and this one I'm going to make a little bit darker and it also will be a slight gray. So now let's take the color we'll plug that into the base color and then ctrl shift and click on the principled and you can see that's starting to look more like a rock. Now the rocks are really smooth and so I want to add some normal to make them look more like rocks. So I'm going to plug this factor up to the normal. Now there's some shading issues and that's because you can't plug the gray one into the normal one which is purple so we need to convert it to normal data so the principled shader can use it. So to convert it I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a bump node. We're just going to drop the bump node right here and then we want to plug the factor up to the height and then the normal from the bump can go into the normal. So now that looks a lot more like rock. You can also play around with the strength so if that's maybe too strong you can just turn it down. I think I'll just turn it to like a 0.5 so it's not quite as strong but there we go there's just a basic rock material. So now we can go ahead and make the ore. So to make the ore I'm going to press shift a we're going to start by searching for a verona texture. Let's just drop this down here and then I can ctrl shift and click on it to preview it. Now right here click on the f1. I want to change this to the distance to edge and you can see now we have that crackly look and that is really cool. And then also the object right here I want to plug this up to the vector and then this is actually a little bit too much ore. I don't really want this much so the scale here I'm going to actually change this to like a three so that it's a bit bigger of pieces. Now you can also see that these are a little bit different like these pieces are a bit bigger than these pieces and this is because we need to apply the scale for all the objects that they all use about the same size of the ore. So I'm going to click and then shift click on all the different objects that they're all selected and then I'm going to press ctrl a and we just want to apply the scale. So now they're all the same size and you can see now it's actually quite small so the scale I think I will make that even smaller. I think a two looks pretty good. Yeah two is pretty good but of course you can change it to whatever looks good and then if you need to change the scale the noise texture you can do that as well. I might just like change that to a four. Let's just look at our final material that looks pretty good. So I can just ctrl shift and click back on the Verona texture. So now what I want to do is I kind of want to make a mask to tell it that we're only going to have some pieces white and then those white pieces are going to be popping out and those are going to be the pieces of ore. So I'm going to press shift a we're going to search for another color ramp and I'm going to drop the color ramp right down here and then what I want to do is take the white value and pull it way up and then the black value also pull that up. So we're basically just making a mask and so where the white bits are that is where the ore is going to be popping out. So I do want this to go into the displacement so it'll actually displace the mesh but I also just want to put it through the normal. So to do this I'm going to take the bump and I'll press shift d and just drop it right behind it and then this noise texture the factor I actually want to put it into the height of the first one and then the normal I want that to go into the normal of the second one. And then the color ramp here from the Verona texture I want to put the color into the height and then I'll just control shift and click on it so you can see what it's doing it's basically popping that out. And then I'll turn the strength all the way up to one and then this factor here on the noise texture I don't want that to go into the normal so I need to unplug that and there we go that is what we're looking for. So now we're using the mask that we made to just bump that out and that's not going to bump it out a ton but it'll bump it out a little bit. And then this normal is going through here so then this noise texture is plugging into the second one so if I control shift and click on it you can see there's the second one and now we have those little pieces that are bumping out. So then we also want these pieces to be going through the displacement so that it really pops out the geometry but I also want some of the rock texture to do that as well because I do like this noise here I want some of it to be contributing to the displacement but mostly I just want the Verona texture to be bumping it out. So to do this I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a mix RGB I'm just going to drop the mix RGB right down here and then we're just going to take the color from the color ramp and we're going to put that into color one then right up here on the noise texture I'm going to take the factor and we're going to plug that into color two of this mix so now I can control shift and click on it and you can see we're mixing them both together. So now we can take this color here and put that into the displacement on the material output and then I'll just control shift and click on the principle so you can see it's doing something but that doesn't look very good and that's because we didn't convert this to the displacement data. So to convert it we're going to press shift a and I'm going to search for the displacement node and we can just drop it in here and then I'm just going to drag it right down here so we have this yellow color and that color data is going to go into here and it's actually going to go into the height value so the mix shader is going to go into the height and then the displacement is going to go into the displacement on the material output. Now right here this mid level I'm going to turn this to zero on the displacement because I don't want that and then this scale is way too strong so I'm going to turn it down to like a 0.1 let's see how that looks that is better and now you can see that it's actually displacing it so if you kind of zoom in here you can see that those chunks there they're kind of popping out and that looks really really cool if you want to turn the scale up maybe to like a 0.3 you could that's maybe a little bit strong maybe a 0.2 you can do whatever looks good I like a 0.1 I think that's pretty good so I'm just going to leave it at 0.1. 0.2 looks pretty good as well all right so that is looking really good but now we need to tell it that those chunks that are popping out need to be a gold material or some kind of ore material so we need to make the ore material and then we're going to need to use a mask to tell it where it's going to be that separate material so I'm going to press shift a and we're going to search for another principal bsdf and I'll just drop it right up here so this is going to be the ore material so the metallic I'm going to turn that all the way up to one so it's metal and then I can also control shift and click on it just so we can preview it and then this base color right here I'm going to make this like a yellowy color although I don't want it to be that saturated and I do want it to be a little bit more orange so something like that maybe something like that and then I also do want it to be fully bright and then the roughness here I'm going to turn this down to maybe like a 0.35 so that is more shiny so that is starting to look like a gold material all right now we also want to take the bump right here and we want to use this bump in the principled bsdf right here of the gold so this normal right here from the bump we want to plug this into the normal and then if I control shift and click on it you can see it just gives it a bit more bump all right so now let's combine these both together because we have the rock and we have the gold but we need to combine them together so I'm going to press shift a I'm going to search for a mix shader we're just going to drop this down here kind of move this out of the way and then we want to plug these both up so both of these principled we want to plug them both into the mix shader and then as I said earlier we need some sort of mask to tell it where it's going to be one shader and where it's going to be the other so I'm going to press shift a to do this we're going to add another color ramp very useful node I'm going to bring this up and then the color ramp I'm just going to put that in the middle and then we're going to take the color and plug that up to the factor and then we've already created our mask if you control shift and click on this you can see we already have a mask to tell it where it's going to be rock and where it's going to be gold so we'll take the color and plug that into the factor here on this color ramp and then we can control shift and click on this now you might think that maybe we could just take the color ramp and plug the color up to the factor right here and you could certainly do that but the problem with this is that it's kind of subtle because you can see that some of the gold and some of the rock is kind of blending together so I'm going to use this color ramp to make it very very contrasty although what we need to do first is we need to switch these two because the gold is on the wrong one so we'll just click drop this down here and then bring that up there all right that is really starting to look pretty cool but as you can see this is kind of blending together so to make it more contrasty we can take the white tab and just drag this way over and then if I control shift and click on it you can see what it's doing so it's taking these kind of gray areas and it's just removing them and making it super super white so that's a very contrasty and now we can control shift and click on it and there we go you can see it's very defined where it's going to be gold and where it's going to be the rock now I think there's actually too many chunks of ore so right here on the scale on the verona texture I can just change that down to maybe like a 1 maybe like a 1.5 you're really going to have to play around with this it really depends that looks a lot better and then of course right here you can play around with this color ramp so if you want to have less ore you can just pull the black value more towards the white and you can see now that's going to be smaller so there's going to be less ore or you could do it the opposite if you want there to be bigger pieces you can pull the white over towards the black and then you may have also noticed that some of these pieces of gold they have like these little flat pieces right here and I do like that that is pretty cool um for some of them but if that's happening too much what you can do right here you can change this white value so if you turn like the white tab farther away you can see now it's much more sharp right there but then if you turn it closer you can see now it's going to have like a flat bit really just get it to your own personal preference I do like it being pretty sharp but then I also like having a little bit of those pieces so really you can just do whatever you want all right and then we just have one last really cool thing to make this material look really nice we can actually change this color here so if you have a specific color in mind you can of course just change it but I want to give myself a lot of options so that I can change the different colors whenever I want really easily so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for the RGB just add the RGB and I'm just going to drop it right here and then I actually want to add five of them so I'm going to press shift d click and drop it shift d shift d and shift d all right and then I'll bring these up so we now have five of them and then I'll just change all the different colors so the first one I want to be the gold color so I can actually drag and drop the color and drop color that over and then the second one I want that to be a diamond color so I'm going to bring it way up so it's really bright and then make it kind of a bright blue color we can just plug this in and see how it looks and then you could also make it just like slightly on the yellowish side or the greenish side if you want to you could also make it a darker blue and then we can also make emerald ore so I'll plug this one in here and then this one we're going to make green so I'm going to make it a green color pretty bright but not super saturated so there we go for emerald ore and then let's also make ruby ore so I'm going to plug this into here and then let's just make this like a red color really bright but not super saturated I find that if it's like super saturated it looks a little bit weird you can see that almost looks like velvet or something so I'm just going to make it a little bit less saturated that looks a lot better and there's a lot more reflections as well so there we go and then the last one I'm going to make it fully white and this one is going to be iron ore so I actually really like the iron ore I think it might be my favorite I do really like the diamond ore and the gold ore too of course so now we can actually put these together into one node so to put them together I'm going to box select all of them just make sure they're all selected and then I'm going to press ctrl g and that's going to create our own custom node so I can unplug this from the node group and then I'm going to plug them from top to bottom so here's the gold so just plug them from top to bottom plug it into the extra slot and then if you select this node group and press n for the side panel here you can click right over here on group and you can actually rename these so I'm going to name this one gold or diamond or emerald or and ruby ore and then the last one is iron ore all right there we go so we named all of these now let's press the tab key and that's going to go out of this custom node that we made so you can see this custom node also has a name so we can name it so we can call it or type so there we go or type and then we also need to put that on the label so I'm just going to select this and press ctrl c to copy on the label ctrl v and now it says or type and then also on this node group right here we can click on this and also add the ore type so now this is just super easy to use we can just drag and drop these so we have gold or diamond or emerald or and ruby ore and then iron or very cool so right here this dicing scale make sure you don't turn this down too low and too detailed because if it's too high detail then when you render it it might crash blender so just don't go crazy with the detail for me if I just turn these to five and then turn these ones to eight that works just fine so I'm going to render this out and we'll check out the final thing all right there we go so there is the procedural ore material definitely let me know in the comments what your favorite type of ore is the gold ore is really cool I also really like the diamond ore and the iron ore I think is really cool as well so that's going to be it for this tutorial and thank you so much for watching and I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and if you'd like to purchase the project files you can do that over on my gumroad store or you can join my patreon page and get the project files as well and that'll also help to support me so thanks for watching I hope you have a great day and I hope to see you in a future video"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxQUaMlk3A,Procedural Brick Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, Ryan King demonstrates how to create a procedural brick material using Blender, incorporating adaptive displacement to make the bricks appear as if they are popping out of the mesh. The tutorial covers setting up an icosphere with even geometry, applying a brick texture, using the Node Wrangler add-on for efficient node management, and integrating noise textures for added realism and grunge. Additionally, King discusses using Sketchfab for 3D model previews and sales, and offers project files for supporters on Gumroad and Patreon.","Hey everyone, this is Ryan King and in this Blender tutorial we're going to be creating this procedural brick material in Blender. And we're even going to be using displacements to actually make the bricks pop out of the mesh. So if I just go into rendered mode here I can show you, so if you zoom in here you can see that the bricks are actually being displaced and they're actually popping out of the mesh. Now this displacement is adaptable, you can see that I've turned on the adaptive subdivision and I'll show you how to set this up in the tutorial, but you can see this is a little bit low quality so I just need to update this, so I'll just double tap on the tab key and that'll just kind of update it because we went into edit mode and then we went back into object mode and you can see, there we go. So you can see with this displacement here it's actually displacing the mesh and so we're going to use this procedural brick texture and it's going to go through here and then it's going to actually displace the mesh, so that is super cool. Just a couple quick things before we get started, if you'd like to help support this channel and also get the project files for this procedural material as well as other project files, then you can do that over on my Gumroad store and my Patreon page, the links are in the description. And I'd also like to give a huge thanks to Sketchfab for sponsoring this video. On Sketchfab you can upload your own 3D models and preview them in your browser. You can even view them in AR, VR, or on a phone or tablet. You can also purchase 3D models and assets from Sketchfab's model store. You can even apply to sell your own models on the platform. Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. Alright so real quick before we actually start doing the material setup, I just wanted to show you the setup that I have. So what I did is I pressed shift A and I just added an icosphere. Because this is a part of my procedural series of tutorials on YouTube, I just want to use a sphere, but of course you could just make like a brick wall or whatever object you want to use. The important thing is that the geometry is pretty even, so you can see that all these faces are about the same. And that's because we'll be using the subdivision surface modifier and then we'll be using the adaptive subdivision. And that way it'll add the extra geometry that we need to actually displace the mesh. So it doesn't have to be super detailed, but just make sure it has even topology. And then I added a camera and I just pointed it right at the sphere. And then I also just used this plane light, so it just adds some nice lighting on the sphere. And then also to get some nice lighting, I added this Aerodynamics Workshop 1K. And this is on polyhaven.com, so I'll leave the link in the description if you'd like to download it. It's a free HDRI. And so I just added this in as an environment texture to get some nice lighting. All right, so let's go over to the shading tab and we can get started. So I'm just going to go into rendered mode just so that we can see it right up here. I'll just click on the sphere right here and then we can just click on new. And I can just call this procedural brick, procedural brick, just like that. And then one more thing real quick before we get started, I'm going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on while we're setting this up. So if you don't have the Node Wrangler enabled, you can just click on edit and then go to the preferences. And then right over here on the add-ons, you can just start to type in Node right over here on the search and you can just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on. It's built into Blender, so it will be there. So just check mark it. And then right behind me, there's the save preferences button. You can click on the save preferences button if you want the Node Wrangler add-on to be in all your future Blender projects. It's a really useful add-on and I'll show you how we're going to use it. So we can just close the user preferences now. All right, so let's get started with this procedural setup. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to go to the search and we are going to start with a brick texture. So the brick texture is going to be the base of our material. Now we just turned on the Node Wrangler add-on. So what you can do is you can hold down the control and shift key and then click on a node. And what that's going to do is it's going to add the viewer node and then you'll be able to preview different nodes. So you can hold down the control and shift key and click on different nodes and it'll preview them. So there's the brick texture, but you can see that it's rotated a little bit weird. You can of course set this up however you like. You probably aren't going to use a sphere. You're probably going to use a brick wall or something like that, but I'm just using a sphere. What I'm going to do is just select this node and then I'm going to press control T and that's using another feature from the Node Wrangler. And what it's going to do is it's going to add this texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Then what I want to do is I just want to use object. I'm going to use object. Of course, if you're making a brick wall, you might want to like UV unwrap it. Really just set that up however you like. I'm just going to use object and then the object shouldn't be in the location. It needs to be right up here on the vector. So on the top one, just like that. All right. And then we can use this mapping node to rotate the texture. So right here on the rotation, we need to rotate the X value by 90 degrees. So I'm just going to click on it, type in nine zero and enter. And there we go. Now it's rotated over by 90 degrees. And then also we can play around with the size because it's a little bit high detail right now. So right here on the brick texture, I'm going to turn the scale down a little bit and that way there'll be less bricks. You can just set this to whatever you like. So now we can go ahead and set up the colors. So color one, I want this to be like a red color, not super saturated. If you bring it way down here, it's going to be extremely saturated. Just kind of like this, a bright red, something like that. And then color two is going to be kind of a darker red, a little bit brown, kind of like a reddish brown, something like that is pretty good. So you can see now the bricks just kind of have random colors and then the mortar, that is the stuff in between. I just want to make this actually a little bit of a lighter brown, not super light, but just kind of like a brown color and probably a little bit less saturated. All right. Something like that is pretty good. And we can change these later if we need to. So that is looking pretty good. Now let's take the color and we're going to put it into the color of the base color on the principled BSDF and I can now hold down the control and shift key and click on the principled and we can see it starting to look like bricks. We need to add a lot more realism though. So let's do that. So first, I just want to add some basic bump with this normal here. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the factor and plug that into the normal. Now, this doesn't work because this is gray and this is purple. So we need to convert it to normal data. So to convert it, we're going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a bump node. We're just going to drop the bump node right here. And then we just want to put the factor up to the height and then the normal into the normal. So now if you kind of go on side view here and look at it, you can see it's kind of popping out, but it's actually the wrong way. So you can just click on the invert button and it's going to flip that. And then we might as well set up the displacement now. So the displacement is optional. If you don't want to use the displacement, you don't have to, but I think it does make the bricks look a lot more realistic because these bricks are actually going to pop out of the mesh. So let's set that up. So the first thing that I'm going to do is click right up here, bring this out. What I need to do is on the feature set right here, I need to set this to experimental. So we'll change it to experimental. Then what we need to do is we need to click right over here on the material properties and let's just go right down here to the settings. And then right here under surface, you can see that there is a displacement. So on default, it's set to bump only. I want to use displacement and bumps. We're going to turn that on. So it's telling it to actually use the displacement. So now we just need to do two more things. We need to give it more detail, so more geometry. And then we also need to give it data to actually displace it. So let's click right over here on the modifiers. We're going to click on add modifier and we want to add the subdivision surface. And it might be a little bit laggy at first when we're adding it. All right. And there we go. It added the subsurf. Now we want to turn on the adaptive subdivision because this is really helpful. And this way it's only going to add geometry where we're actually looking at it. So if we zoom close up here, like if you're doing an animation or something like that and you zoom the camera up, it's going to subdivide it and make it higher detail where you're looking at it. But then on a part that's farther away or a part that you can't see, it'll make that lower detail. So that is going to be really helpful for performance and making it higher detail where you actually see it. And then I thought I'd just add this in the video because it might be helpful to some people. So if you want to make like a brick wall, what I did is I just made this simple object And then I added the finished brick material, but you can see because we have this adaptive subdivision, it is a subdivision surface. And so it smooths it out. And so it almost looks like kind of like a pillow shape. And for a brick wall, you want it to be sharp on the edges. Now you could add bevels, but that's going to add a lot more geometry to your mesh and you already have this subdivision. So what you can do instead to fix this issue right now, it's set to catmull-clark. If you just change it to simple, now it's still going to subdivide the mesh, but it's going to keep the edges sharp. Just thought I'd throw that in the video for anyone who wants to make a brick wall. And then you can see here that there is a dicing scale. What you do if you want more detail is you turn it down. So you could just leave it at one. You could also turn it down to like 0.1. That's going to be really high detail. Or if you want to be less detailed, you could turn it up to like 10. So the smaller it is, the more detailed it is. So I'm just going to set it to one. I think one is pretty good. Just note that the higher detail it is, so the smaller you make this, the more processing power it's going to take and the longer it's going to take to actually process it. So you may not want to turn this down super low because it might get laggy or maybe crash blender depending on how powerful your computer is. So I'm just going to leave it at one. That works pretty well for me. All right. So now we just need to actually give it data to displace. So if I go back into rendered mode, I can control shift and click twice on the brick texture. And you can see that the brick texture has a factor value. And this is exactly what we want it to displace because the bricks, we want it to be popping out and then the rest of it, we want to be going back in. So let's take this factor right here and we're going to plug it into the displacement on the material output. Now it doesn't actually really work well right now. You can see it has a really weird thing happening. That's definitely not what we want. And this is because we didn't convert it to displacement data. So what we need to do is press shift day and we need to search for the displacement node. And then we can just drop the displacement node right here and we can just bring this down. And then we don't actually want the factor to be going into the normal because that's gray to purple. So we want to actually put this into the height. So the factor from the brick texture needs to be going into the height and then the displacement on the displacement needs to be going over to the material output here on the displacement value. So there we go. Now, if you look around, you can see it's definitely doing something, although it's popping out the mortar and it's not popping out the bricks. So what we need to do, first of all, is this mid level. We need to turn this to zero because we don't want any of that. And then also we need to turn this scale way down. So I'm going to change it down to like a point one. And that's definitely better, but it's still way too strong. So I'm going to change it down to like a point zero zero eight. And you can see there that is a lot better. That scale is much more realistic, but you can see it's still reversed. So the mortar is going out instead of the bricks. So to switch this, we need to press shift day and we can just search for an invert node. So we're just going to drop the invert node right before the displacement and that'll flip the values. And then if we control shift and click on the principled, it does take a moment to load up because it's doing that displacement. But now you can see if you look on the side here, this is actually real bump. Now you can see that this is pretty low quality. You can see how glitchy that is. And that's because we zoomed really close up to it. So when you render this with the camera, it's always going to reset. So depending on where the camera is, it will displace it correctly using the adaptive subdivision, but it'll actually do this in our view as well. So we just need to update it and then it's going to update from where our view is. So a really easy way to update it is to just tap twice on the tab key and that'll go into edit mode and it will go back into object mode and that'll kind of update it. So you can see it is taking a moment to update. It is taking a little while. We'll just wait for this to finish. There we go. It finished. You can see that is way higher detail. So that is much better. So I can just move to a different area. Actually, I can just go into the camera and then I can just double tap the tab key just to reset it. And of course, if you do anything in here, like if you change the nodes or anything, that'll update it as well and it'll re-render. All right. And then just to make this look a little bit nicer, what I'm going to do is hold down the shift key and then right click and drag, and it's going to add this little reroute right here so I can just drag this up and then shift, right click and drag, add another reroute just that it looks a little bit nicer. This is totally optional. You don't have to do this if you don't want to, but I do think it makes it just a little bit easier to see. And then also we can reroute both of these. So I'm going to hold down the shift key, right click and drag, and it'll reroute that. So there we go. I can just move this down. All right. That looks a little bit nicer. All right. So that is the displacement done. So now let's go ahead and make this look really nice and make it a much more photorealistic. If I zoom in here, you can see all these bricks are very, very straight and that's not really realistic because bricks are somewhat organic. They're a little bit bumpy and rough. So what I want to do is add a texture and use that texture to make the bricks a little bit bumpy. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search here for a noise texture. We'll just drop it right down here. And then I'm going to move the texture coordinate and mapping back a little bit and then plug the vector into the vector of the noise texture. And then what I can do is I can take this factor here and I can plug it into the mortar smooth. So now if I control shift and click on this, this will be a little bit easier to see. And you can see it kind of took a while for it to load up. So what we can do while we're just playing around with this is we can just go over here to the subdivision and we can click on this little icon right here. It looks like a monitor and that will hide the adaptive subdivision. So it'll process a lot quicker. And then at the end, we can just turn it back on and then it will render that displacement. So let's just zoom in here and you can kind of see what it's doing. I want to turn the scale up on the noise texture. So I'm going to turn it up to maybe like a 40 and you can see there it's just adding little lumps and bumps and that looks much more realistic. I'm also going to turn the detail all the way up to 16. So it's nice and detailed. So there we go. You can play around with the scale. You can play around with the detail, really just get to how you like, because you can see if I turn this down, there's going to be like not as many bumps. I do like this at about 40, I think 40 looks pretty good. All right. So I'm just going to control shift and click back on this. Now I also just want to add a little bit of dirt and grunge and things like that on the bricks. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for another noise texture. And we're just going to drop another noise texture right here. And then we can also plug the vector from the mapping up to this vector. So let's control shift and click on the noise texture to preview it. I'm going to turn the scale up to something like an eight, and then I'll turn the detail all the way up to 16. And then I'll turn the roughness up to like a 0.68. So it has a bit more roughness. So now what I want to do is I want to use this noise texture and mix it together with the brick texture. And then we'll put that into the base color. So it'll look like it has a little bit more grunge and dirt and things like that. So to mix these together, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a mix RGB and we're just going to drop the mix RGB right down here. And then we're going to take the factor of the noise texture and plug it into this factor. And then from mix, we're going to change this to darken. So here it is darken, and then we can control shift and click on it to see what it's doing. So we have this set to darken and then the brick texture is going into color one. So color two, let's just make this a dark brown. So I'm going to make it very dark. You can see that now it's adding that noise there and it just looks a little bit dirty and old and worn. So that looks really great. Now I also want this noise texture to be contributing to the bump so that it just has some little bits of bumps and stuff because bricks are pretty rough and bumpy. So I'm going to click on this bump and I'm going to press shift D and just drop it down here and then I kind of need to move everything over. Okay, that is better. We have more room now. So we have this second bump here and we have the height going into the first one and the normal is just going into the normal. So now we have this extra height input and we can put things into it and add to the bump. So I'm going to take the factor from this noise texture and I'm going to plug it way down here on the height right here. And now you can see, look at that, it's making it all super, super bumpy. And then we can also turn off the invert because we don't really need to use that on this one. And then we can also play around with the strength. So right now it is pretty strong. So I'm going to turn it down because I do want it to be more subtle. So I think I'll turn this to like a 0.25. Just look at that. That looks a lot better. So you can see it is rough, but it's not super, super rough. That looks pretty good. All right. Now I also want to add some more grungy stuff and I also want to make it look like there are some pieces of the brick wall that have kind of been crumbling. So what I'm going to do is press shift A and I'm going to search for another mix RGB and I will just drop this mix RGB right here. So what I want to do is use this noise texture and plug it into the mix, but I only want to use some certain areas and make that the crumbling older parts. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp, just drop the color ramp right here. And then this noise texture right here, it's going to go into the factor of the factor of the noise texture. So I can now control shift and click on the noise texture and we can preview it. So I want to make it a lot more contrasty just that we have some areas, but not all the areas. So I'm going to bring this way over and then I'm also going to bring the white tab way over so you can see that now we just have some bits that are white, but then most of it is black. So I can now use this color ramp as the factor for this mix. So we're going to take the color and put that into the factor and then I can control shift and click on this. So I don't want it to be white. I want it to be kind of like a yellowish kind of tannish brownish color. So I'm going to take color two and I'm going to make that kind of like a brownish or tannish color, something like this, whatever you want to do, kind of like a light brown. And then this other mix RGB, it's set to darken. That's going to be going into color one. So let's control shift and click on that. So that does look pretty good, but it doesn't really make any sense right now because it's not contributing to the bump. So it's not like cutting in where that extra detail is. So I actually want to put this into the bump as well. And that way where these parts are, it's going to be cutting in and it's kind of going to look like that part of the brick wall is kind of crumbling away. So I'm going to take a bump, press shift D, we'll just drop it down here and we'll make a third bump. And then I want to take the color ramp here and take the color and plug it into the height. And there you go. You can see that definitely looks better. I do want to turn on the invert because I want it to look like it's going in instead of out. So we're going to turn on the invert and then I also want to turn the strength up quite a bit. All right. And then let's also put a value into the roughness. So what I'm going to do is just take this mix here and we'll put the color into the roughness value. Now when we do this, it's super, super shiny. You can see how shiny that is. It almost looks like it's wet. I don't want this. I want more control over how shiny I want to be. So I'm going to press shift a, we're going to search for a color ramp and we'll drop the color ramp right here. So now what I can do is I can click on this black tab here, which is going through the roughness and I can just turn this up and make it more and more white. And you can see that as I turn it up, it's going to make the bricks more and more rough. So I don't want them to be that rough because that's super rough. But then if I turn it down, that's definitely too shiny. So just kind of like a light gray, something like that is pretty good. All right. So we are almost done with this material. Let's just go back over here to the modifiers and then we can turn on the subdivision so that it'll actually preview it. And check out that final material. Now I just want to update it again. So I'm just going to select it and then double tap on the tab. So it'll go into edit mode and then go back into object mode and that'll just update it. We'll just wait for that to load up. And there we go. Super nice. And the displacement is super cool as well because the bricks actually pop out of the mesh. So there we go. There it is. There is the finished procedural brick material with actual displacement. You can see here over on the side, it's using real displacement and it's actually popping out those bricks in the material. So that's going to be it for this video. Thank you for watching and I hope you enjoyed the tutorial. And if you'd like to help support this channel, I'm trying to make Blender content for a living.

Check out Sketchfab with the link in the description. Alright, so here's the procedural material that we're going to be creating and you can see that we're even going to be adding some moss there on the bark. Now I'm going to be adding this on a cylinder because I want it to look like a tree trunk, but you could also just add it onto a regular sphere if you wanted to, whatever you'd like to do. Now I wanted to show you the setup that I have before we get started. So I'm using the Cycles render engine and because I'm using the Cycles render engine, I added these plane lights. So I just added these two objects right here and then I added an emission material onto them and that way they'll just light up the procedural material. Now also with the lighting, I added in an HDRI from HDRI Haven, so I'll leave a link in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I added. So in the world settings, I just added an environment texture right here and then I opened up the HDRI that I downloaded. Then I also added a camera and just pointed it into the very center of the scene. Now for the object, what I did is I pressed Shift-A and I went right down here and added a cylinder. So then what I did is I tabbed into edit mode and I just went to the face select and selected the top face. Then I pressed Ctrl-B and that's going to add a bevel and then you can scroll with your mouse wheel and just make the amount of vertices just make it kind of smooth and then just click to place that. So I'm going to do the same thing for the bottom, so I'm just going to click on this, press Ctrl-B and then click to place that. Now back in object mode, I'm just going to press Ctrl-2 and that is the shortcut key for adding a subsurf modifier. So it now has a lot more detail and it's very smooth and then I will just apply this modifier and then I can just also shade the object smooth. So now I'm going to hop over to the shading tab and then we can make the procedural material. Now one more really quick thing before we start, I'm going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on, so if you don't have that enabled you can go right over here to edit and then click on the preferences and then in the user preferences just click on the add-ons right here and then you're going to click on the search and you're going to search for node and then just check mark the Node Wrangler add-on and then we can use it when we're setting up our procedural material and then I'll just close the preferences. All right, so now we can finally set up this material. So I'm just going to go into rendered mode so that we can preview the material right here. So I'm going to click on new and then I can just call this procedural bark. All right and then if I zoom out here, if I can find it, here we go. So it added in a principled BSDF shader on default and that is great. So I'm first going to start by pressing shift a and I'm going to add a wave texture. So I'm adding in this wave texture because we want to make those grooves kind of in the bark it kind of goes up and down but then it's kind of wiggly. So I'm going to add the wave texture and then using the feature from the Node Wrangler I can hold down the ctrl and shift key and click on the node and then that will preview it. And then also using another feature from the Node Wrangler I'm going to press ctrl t with this node selected and it's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping node. And then I just want to set the object into the mapping and that way it'll place the texture around the object more evenly. And the object mapping also works really well when you're placing this material on other objects. All right now let's change the scale. I'm going to change this to maybe like a three because I don't want quite that many lines. And then I'm going to turn the distortion up to maybe somewhere around a seven so it's a little bit distorted. And then I do want there to be quite a bit of detail because bark is pretty rough. So I'm going to turn the detail up to like eight and you can see that if I zoom in here there's all that little bit of detail and that's really great. And then the detail scale I think I'll turn this up to like a 3.5 and now you can see we're really starting to get some nice detail in that bark. All right now I want to put this into the normal so that it can make the bark bumpy. So the color I'm going to put that into the normal but then what we need to do is we need to convert this to normal data because you can see this yellow one right here this is a color but then this is a purple one so we need to convert it. So to convert it I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a bump node. I'm just going to drop the bump node right here and then what we want to do actually is we want the factor to go into the height and then that'll go through the bump node and then it will go into the normal. So now if I control shift and click on this you can see there we go we're already getting some nice bump there. And then if you want to change the strength you can you could turn it down if you want I just want to leave it up at one so it's very bumpy. All right and then I also want this wave texture to be contributing to the color because right now it's white we could just turn this to like a brown color if we wanted like a bark color but I want the wave texture to actually contribute to that. So the color I'm just going to plug that up to the base color. Now that does not look very good that doesn't look like bark and so what we need to do is change the colors in between. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. I'll just drop the color ramp node right here and then we can just take this white value and the dark value and just play around with it to get the colors that we want. So this black tab I'm just going to click on it and then I'm going to change it to a dark brown. I don't want it to be super saturated just kind of like a dark brown I don't want to bring it way to the end of the color wheel because then it'll be too saturated just kind of a light brown something like that. Although I do want it to be darker so I will bring the darkness down quite a bit. All right that is good and then this one I want to be a brown color as well but this one is going to be a lighter brown. So it's still going to be somewhat dark but it'll be a little bit lighter maybe something like that. I want to make this one a little bit less saturated though because it seems like a lot of bark actually looks pretty gray so I'll make it a little less saturated something like that looks pretty good. So you can see there we go that's already looking a lot like bark. Now there's a few more things that I want to do. I want to add in moss so let's go ahead and do that. So to add in the moss I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a noise texture. We'll just drop the noise texture right here above the wave texture and then I also want the mapping and texture coordinate to be plugging into it so let's take the vector and plug that into the vector of the noise texture and then I can ctrl shift and click on the noise texture to preview it. Now I want to turn the scale up quite a bit so I'm going to turn it up to like a 15 so there's a lot more of that noise and then the detail I'll turn that all the way up to 16 so that the noise texture is very detailed and then the roughness I think I'll turn this up to like a 0.62 so you can see adding just a little bit more roughness adds even more detail so I like how that looks. All right now this noise texture is mainly going to be used to add the moss but I think it will add more detail and make it look better if it's also going into the color a little bit as well so I'm just going to mix these two together just so that this wave texture has a little bit of the noise because you can see with how it is now these white parts don't really have much detail so I'm going to mix this noise in with the wave texture so to do that I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a mix rgb we'll just drop that there and then I will just take the factor and plug that into color one and then the wave texture that's going to be going into color two and then because I want to mix them both together I don't want to set it to mix because mix is just going to use one or the other and you can see if I change the factor it's just going to switch between them I want to change this to multiply so you can see now if I turn the factor all the way to zero it's just the noise texture but then if I turn the factor up it's adding the wave texture in with it so now you can see if you just ctrl shift and click on the color ramp or just click right here you can see that it's basically adding those on together so now we have the noise as well as the wave texture and that gives even more detail but then I also want to add the moss on top so let's go ahead and do that so the noise texture I can just ctrl shift and click on it we want to make a mask and then use that mask to tell it where the moss is going to be and where it's not going to be so to make the mask I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to add a another color ramp we'll just drop the color ramp right here so the factor is going to be going into the color ramp and then I'll just ctrl shift and click on the color ramp so we need to make it very clear where the moss is going to be and where the moss isn't going to be so this black value I'm going to drag this way out and then the white value I will drag up as well so they're very close to each other and you can see this is very contrasty and so where it's white that's where the moss is going to be and where it's black there's not going to be any moss so if you want there to be lots of moss you could kind of bring them over here but if you want there to be just a little bit of moss you could bring them both over here so wherever the white parts are that's where the moss is going to be all right so that looks good we can play around with that later if we'd like to so now we just need to add this in and then we'll plug it into the base color so what I'm going to do is press shift a and I'm going to search for a another mix rgb and we'll just drop it down here so color one is going to be the bark color and then color two is going to be the moss color so for the moss I'm just going to make it kind of like a green kind of like a dark green maybe slightly more on the yellow side just make whatever color you like for moss so I can control shift and click on this but now it just adds a green tint and so we want to use this color ramp here as the factor to tell it where the moss is going to be and where it's not going to be so we'll just plug the color of the color ramp right into the factor and then if I control shift and click on the mix you can see that there we go there's just little bits of moss and then if you want a little bit more moss I think I will have a little bit more moss I can just kind of drag that around and there we go looking very good all right so let's just control shift and click on this to preview that and then let's just zoom into the moss so the moss looks pretty good but it's not bumping out at all so I want to also take this color ramp and use it in the bump so the bump here I'm just going to select this and I'll press shift d to duplicate it and just drop it down here and then the normal is just going to go through the normal so now you can see we have this extra height one right here and we can add this in and then we can add both of the bumps together and then that'll go into the principal so what we're going to do is just take the color ramp right here take the color and plug that into the height and now if I control shift and click on this you can see there is the moss so if you just click on the bump and then press m that will mute the node and you can see the moss isn't there and then if I press m to unmute it there we go there's these little bits of moss and it's even more detailed and then if you want to change the strength if you don't want the moss to be very bumpy you can turn that down so I can control shift and click on this now and you can see there we go the moss has little bits of bump and if I press m to mute that you can see that doesn't really look good it just looks like it's in the bark but then if I press m there we go it looks like it pops out a little bit and then also what we can do to just give it a little bit more detail is we can take the noise texture this factor and we can plug it into the roughness and then that's going to tell it where it's going to be more rough and where it's going to be more shiny and then if you want more control over this where it's going to be more rough and where it's going to be more shiny you can press shift a and again search for another color ramp and I'm just going to drop it down here now bark is pretty rough so I don't want it to be that rough so this black value I'm actually going to turn it way up and you can see that right here right over here where it's kind of shiny you can see it's very rough because I turn this up to white but if I turn it down to black you can see it's much more shiny so bark is a little bit shiny everything does have a little bit of reflection but bark is pretty rough so you can just change this to whatever you want you could also take this white value and turn it down if you want everything to be more shiny I'm just going to keep this up and then I'll just make this one kind of a gray color all right and then just ctrl shift and click on the principled bsdf to preview the final material so I'm just going to render this out and we'll take a look all right here we go so here is the procedural bark material you can see it has a lot of detail in there and it's got those little mossy bits so that's it for this tutorial I hope this was

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPI9xq41nOk,Procedural Watermelon Shader (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial video, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural watermelon shader in Blender. The process involves setting up a UV sphere to resemble a watermelon, using Cycles Render with plane lights for realistic lighting, and customizing shader nodes for texture and color. The tutorial covers using a wave texture for stripes, adding a noise texture for realistic details, and adjusting colors with a color ramp to achieve a watermelon appearance. The video also guides on tweaking the shader for shine and bumpiness to mimic real watermelon skin. Additionally, the creator offers project files on Gumroad and Patreon to support the channel.","In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural watermelon shader in Blender. Now, if you'd like to get the project files for this tutorial and also help to support the channel, then you can do that on my Gumroad store and my Patreon with the links in the video description. Before we get started, I wanted to show you the setup that I have. So I just have a camera and I just have this pointed at the center of the scene. And then I just pressed Shift-A, and I went over here to Mesh, and then I just added in a UV sphere. Now, when I added in the UV sphere, I pressed R to rotate, X on the X-axis, and I typed in 90, Enter, and that way it was over sideways like this. And then I also shaded the object smooth, and then I also tabbed into Edit Mode, and I pressed S to scale, and Y on the Y-axis, and I just scaled it out a little bit, just so that it looks like a watermelon. And then, right over here on the modifiers, I also added a new modifier, and I added the Subdivision Surface Modifier just so that it's a little bit smooth. So that's how I created this watermelon object. If you'd like to create it that way, that's how I did it. Now, I also added in these two plane lights. I am using Cycles Render, so I just like to use plane lights. And then over here, I just added in a new material and I set it to an emission. And then to get some even more realistic lighting, I went over here to the world and I added in this AutoShop 01 1K HDR, and this is on HDRI Haven. So I'll leave a link in the video description if you'd like to download the same HDRI. All right, let's get started. Now, I also rotated my watermelon a little bit just because I like that a little bit better. And then I have the 3D view right here so that we can see it as we create it. And then right over here, I have the shader nodes. So I'm just going to click on New, and I'm just going to call this Watermelon. And then right here, you can see that on default, it added in a principled BSDF, so that is what we want. So I'm just going to start by pressing Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a wave texture. I'm just going to drop the wave texture right here. And then I'm also using the Node Wrangler add-on, so if you don't have that enabled, you can go to Edit and then go to the User Preferences. And then right over here under the add-ons, you can just go to the search here and start to type in Node. And then you can see that there's this Node Wrangler add-on. Just checkmark that and then it'll be enabled. All right, I'm going to close the User Preferences. So now that the Node Wrangler is enabled, I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on the wave texture, and that's going to preview it. Now, also using another feature from the Node Wrangler, I can press Ctrl-T when this wave texture is selected, and that's going to automatically add in a texture coordinate and mapping node. And this texture coordinate and mapping, it's going to tell it how the texture is going to be placed on the object. So I don't want to use Generated, I actually want to use UV, because I want to use the UV map of the sphere. And because the UV sphere is automatically unwrapped, it's unwrapped on default in Blender, you can see that that's already starting to look a little bit like a watermelon. It has those little stripes there with that wave texture. Now, if you want to play around with how many stripes there are on the watermelon, what you can do is you can go over to the UV editing. And then let me just escape out of this and then we'll go back into rendered mode. So if I tab into edit mode, you can see right over here, because I'm in the UV editing tab, here is our UV layout. So I can just press A to select everything. And then if you scale this, you can see that it's adding more and more waves or less and less of those waves from the wave texture. So you can play around with this later once the procedural material is done and just scale it to the size that you want, if you'd like to do that. Let's go back over to the shading tab right here and we'll keep working on this. So this is starting to look like a watermelon. Of course, the colors aren't correct, but we will get to that later. But these stripes here, they're very boring and I want to add a lot more interest to the stripes. So what I'm going to do is turn this distortion value up to 4 on the wave texture. You can turn it up more or less if you want. I think 4 looks pretty good. And you can see because we are using the UV mapping, there is a little bit of a seam here, but we're going to have to have a seam somewhere because we're using the UV map. So what I'm going to do is actually just double tap R and rotate this until we can't see the seam. So just something like that, that is pretty good. And then later on, as I said, you can go over to the UV editing and play with the scale and that way you can make it so that the seam is harder to see. All right, now this detail here on the wave texture, I'm also going to turn this up. So I'm going to turn up to something like a 5 and you can see that when I zoom in here, there's a lot more detail. That is great. And then the detail roughness, I'm going to turn this all the way up to 1 and you can see what it's doing. It looks a lot more interesting now. But I still want to add a lot more noise because this is an organic, you know, fruit. So having this whole area here where it's just white and there's no noise or anything and also having these areas where it's just fully black, that's not going to look very good. So what I'm going to do is press Shift A and I'm going to add a noise texture. So just search for a noise texture, here it is. Now we're actually going to drop it right here after the wave texture. So I'll just drop it in and then this color is just going to go into the vector and then I want to Control Shift and click on this until we can see the factor. So the scale, I'm going to turn this down to like a 1 so that the scale is a lot smaller and you can start to see it's looking a little bit better. Now the detail, I actually want to turn this all the way down on the noise texture and you can see now we can start to see those waves again, so that is better. And then the roughness, I think I'm going to turn this down a little bit. You could play around with it. I think I'll just turn it down just a little bit. And then the distortion, I'm actually going to turn this up to like a 0.4 so just a little bit of distortion, you can see it looks a little bit better. Alright, so now we can actually make the colors that we want because this isn't a watermelon color. So I'm going to press Shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp. I'm just going to drop the color ramp right here and then what we can do is we can actually take this color ramp and we can take the output and put that into the base color of the principled BSDF. Let's Control Shift and click on the color ramp though and then we can play around with the different tabs to make the colors that we want. So the first thing I'm going to do is click on this white tab and then I'm going to pull it out and I'll just bring it like right over here. You can see there's the position if you want to change it to the exact position that I'm changing it to or you can just eyeball it and get it to how you like. And then I don't want it to be white, I want it to be a green color. So we're going to make it a bright green color and then I'll just turn it down because I don't want it to be quite that bright but a very saturated green color like that. But I do want it to be pretty dark green so I will turn it down a little bit more, something like that. Alright, now I also want to have an even darker green color. So this black one here, I'm just going to drag this over here. So that it's behind this one. And then I will make it a very similar color but just a little bit darker. Alright, something like that for now is good. Now I'm also going to click on the plus here to add a new tab and we're going to drag this tab over just to somewhere kind of around here. And then this one I want to be a very, very bright green color. So this is going to be all the way up to white and then this will actually be slightly more on the yellow side so you can see it's slightly yellow. And then let's add another one. So I'm going to click on the plus here to add a new one and this one we will kind of bring over here. And that way it's just pretty close to this one. And then this one I want to make it a little bit more green and a little bit less yellow. But still fully bright but just a little bit more on the yellow side, something like that. So you can see now we have these four colors. So we have a very, very bright yellow, a very, very bright green and then a dark green and an even darker green. And you can see the effect that we're getting. Now this isn't very detailed and I want to make it even more detailed. So there's some things that you can play around with. You can play around with the detail size here. So you can see if I start to turn it up then you can kind of zoom in here and you can see if I just turn that detail up it's starting to get more and more detailed. I don't like to turn it up too high because if you turn it up too high it's just going to get super, super, super detailed and that is like too detailed. It kind of looks like grains of sand or something. So I don't want it to be quite that detailed. But I think if it's a little bit more detailed you can see now you're starting to get those little bits of detail in there which is what I like. So just find something that looks good for you, maybe somewhere around a nine. Now you can also turn the distortion up if you don't quite like how this is. So I'm just going to turn the distortion up a little bit more. I don't want to turn it up too far because you can see now you can't really see the stripes. But if you turn it down too small then everything's going to be really flat. So just play around with it. I like it to be a bit wobbly but not too wobbly so maybe around a six or a seven. All right, let's control shift and click on the principal BSDF and that is looking pretty good. Now this watermelon isn't very shiny and watermelon usually is a little bit shiny and then also watermelon usually is a little bit bumpy. It usually has just a little bit of bumps. Kind of if you rub your hand on it you can just feel just some subtle bumps here and there. So I want to change the roughness and then I want to also just give it a little bit of normal. So to change the roughness what I'm going to do is actually take this color here and we're going to put it into the roughness value. So now it's like a super shiny watermelon. It almost looks like a mirror. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to box select all the nodes and just kind of pull them back and that way I have a little bit more space in here. So what I can do is press shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp node and I'll just drop the color ramp node right in here. And then we can play around with this color ramp and that's going to change how shiny it is. So I can control shift and click on it to preview it and then this black one here I'm going to turn it up because I want it to be more like a gray color and then this white one right here I'm actually going to make this gray as well but just slightly darker. So this is a slightly whiter gray and then this is a slightly darker gray. So if I control shift and click on this you can see it's a little bit more shiny. So you can see if I take this first tab here and if I make it darker you can see it's going to make it more shiny and then if I turn it up and make it lighter it's going to be a lot more rough. So really just play around with this. I don't want it to be quite that shiny. Maybe something like that so there's a little bit of reflection but not too much, something like that. All right, now I want to give it a little bit of noise for the bump. So I'm going to press shift A. We're going to search for another noise texture. I'm just going to drop this noise texture right here and then I'm just going to take the vector for this and plug it up to the vector here so that they're using the same mapping and then I can control shift and click on this to preview the noise texture. So I'm going to turn the scale up maybe to something around like a 16 or maybe even more like a 20 however much bumpiness you want and then we need to actually plug the factor into the normal. But then if I control shift and click on this you can see something is wrong with the shading and that's because we need to convert this to normal data because this factor right here, this is just black and white but then this one here, this is a purple one because it's normal. So we need to convert this. So I'm going to press shift A and add a bump and the bump node is going to convert it to normal data. So we need to plug the factor up to the height and then the normal will go through the normal. So now if I control shift and click on this you can see our watermelon is very, very bumpy and I don't want it that bumpy. So the strength here, I'm going to turn this way down to like a 0.01, something like that. That may actually be not quite bumpy enough because you can barely even see it. If I control shift and click on the bump you can see it's there but it's very, very subtle. Maybe turn this up to like a 0.03, something like that. Let's see that. You can kind of see it in the reflections. It should be very subtle though because watermelon are pretty smooth and then you could also turn the scale up here on the noise texture if you want that bump to be a little bit smaller. All right, so just control shift and click on the principal BSDF to preview the final material. Now real quick before we finish the video if you want to change the size of this you can. So I'm just going to select this and then go over to the UV editing tab and then just go into the rendered view. So I can just press A to select all of the UV mapping and then if I scale this up or down it's going to change the size of the stripes. And then I just flip the watermelon back over so that you could see the seam and here's the seam. It's pretty hard to see but if I tab into edit mode and then select all of these I can scale the UV mapping and you can see that there's the seam. You can now see it if I just like scale that down a little bit. So what you want to do is just scale this so that one of these stripes is right in the very center of the seam. So really just scale it to whatever you want but just make sure that one of those stripes are in the center of the seam and then it's very very hard to see. You can barely see it and then you could also just flip it around so that the watermelon is on the other side and that way you can't even see the seam. All right, there we go. So that is how you create this procedural watermelon shader in Blender. I hope this video was helpful and thank you so much for watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMCuDjXjsZ0,Procedural Scratched Metal (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to create a procedural scratched metal material. The process includes enabling the Node Wrangler add-on, setting up an Icosphere with realistic lighting using an HDRI, and constructing a detailed node setup. The tutorial guides viewers through adjusting various textures, including wave and noise textures, to create a realistic metal surface with subtle scratches. It concludes by adding multiple layers of detail for a more intricate look. The video also mentions supporting the creator through Gumroad and Patreon for access to project files.","In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural scratched metal material in Blender. Now, if you'd like to help support the channel and also get the project files for this tutorial as well as my other tutorials, then you can do that on my Gumroads store and my Patreon page. The links are in the description. So here is the procedural setup that we're going to be creating, and so I will walk you through the entire process on how to create this. Now, I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial, so if you don't have that enabled, you can just go to the Edit and then go to the Preferences. And then over here on the add-ons, the search here, you're just going to start to type in Node, and then just turn on the Node Wrangler add-on. If you don't know how to use this, I will show you how to use this. It's a really great add-on for working with procedural nodes in Blender. Now, real quick before we continue, I wanted to show you the setup that I have. So I just have an Icosphere, and I subdivided it and just stuck it in the middle of the world, and I also shaded it smooth. And then I also added this plane light here to get some lighting coming down on the sphere. Now, I also added an HDRI to get very realistic lighting. So you can see right here, I added in this Aerodynamics Workshop 1K HDR, and this is on HDRI Haven. So I'll leave the link in the video description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. So I just downloaded the 1K version, and then I added this in as an environment texture into the world settings. And this will help to get some very realistic reflections on our sphere. And then one last thing before we continue, I wanted to thank Sketchfab for sponsoring this video. Buy, sell, and even upload your own 3D models on Sketchfab. My favorite feature of Sketchfab is that you can preview 3D models in your browser, and even view them on a phone, tablet, or in AR and VR. They also have a huge 3D asset store where you can purchase 3D models and assets. Check out Sketchfab with the links in the description. Alright, so let's get started. So I'm going to hit New right here, and then I can just call this Scratched Metal. And then here are the nodes, so we have the Principled Shader on default. Alright, so let's first make this a metal shader. So the Metallic, I'm going to turn this all the way up so that it's a metal shader. And then we can just turn the roughness down, and you can see already it's starting to look pretty cool. Now I want to add just a tiny little bit of grain or rust or something on the metal, just because I think it looks pretty cool. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a wave texture. I'm just going to drop it right here, and then using a feature from the Node Wrangler, I'm going to select the wave texture and press Ctrl-T. That's going to add the texture coordinate and mapping, and I'm just going to plug the object up to the mapping. And that way, the texture is going to be placed around the object more evenly. And then using another feature from the Node Wrangler, I can hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on the wave texture, and that'll preview it. Alright, let's go ahead and work with these different settings here. So the scale, I'm going to turn this up to like a 0.1, and it does look really big right now, but we're going to play around with some of these settings, which will make it smaller. And you can also totally change this value later if you want to. Now the distortion, I'm going to turn this to something like a 78, so that it has a lot of distortion. And you can already see that you can start to see those waves a lot better. Now the detail, I'm going to turn this up all the way to 16, so that it's very detailed. And the detail roughness, I'm going to turn this up to like a 0.75, and there we go. Now you can really see we have a lot more detail with that detail roughness. So if you want to go back and change the scale now, you can do that if you'd like to. Alright, so I want this wave texture to go into the color, and I also want to put it into the normal. So first, I will just plug it up to the base color, and then I can control shift and click on this, and you can see what it looks like. But I don't want it to be this dark, I just want it to kind of be a subtle thing. So to change the colors, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a color ramp. I'm just going to drop it right here, and then we can change these colors. So this white one right here, this white tab, I'm going to just make this like a light gray. And then this one right here, I'm going to make this a pretty light gray too, but it's going to be pretty close to the first one. So if I control shift and click on it, you can see that these colors are actually pretty close to each other, but one of them is just a little bit darker, and one of them is just a little bit lighter. So when I preview that now, you can see it's just a subtle texture, but it does look pretty cool. Alright, now I also want this to affect the normal, so I'm going to drop it into the normal, and then we need to press shift A, and we need to search for a bump node to convert it to normal data. So we're going to plug this in right here, and then we just need to put the color up to the height. And now you can see it's very, very rough. Now that is way too strong, so I'm going to click on this and just turn this down to a .07, so that it's very, very subtle, but you can still see it. But with how this looks currently, you can see that if I just like look around here, all of this noise here, it's like all over the place, and I just want it to be in some areas, but not all of the areas. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A and search for another color ramp. We will just drop the color ramp right in here before the bump, and then we can play around with this to make some of the parts not bumpy and just keep some of the parts smooth. So I will control shift and click on this to preview it, and then I actually want to switch these. So I'm going to switch the white and the black values, and then you can see, if I just control shift and click back on this, when I start to turn the black up, you can see that some of these areas, there's now some patchy areas that are smooth. So like right there, there's a patchy area that's smooth, there's some smooth areas right there. So now if I control shift and click on this to preview the final material, it just looks a bit nicer, and you can turn this up even more if you want. So you can see that there's just a little bit of areas here and there, which don't have that noise and are pretty smooth. So just play around with this value and get it to how you like. All right, now we're going to add two layers of scratches on top of this. We're going to add just some random scratches that are all around, and then we're going to add some big scratches, which are going up and down. So I'm first going to press shift A and add a noise texture. Here's the noise texture, we'll just drop it here. And then we want to plug the vector up to the vector here. I can now control shift and click on it. Now the scale, I think for now I'm going to turn this to like a 10. We can change that later if we want. And then the detail, I'm going to turn this up to like a 10 as well. Now the roughness, I think I'll turn this up to like a 0.8, so that it has a lot of roughness and that adds even more detail. And then we can turn this distortion up and it's going to just make it a little bit wavy. So I'm going to turn the distortion up to like a 12, and you can see that's what it's looking like. So it's got all this distortion in here, and that'll just make some random scratches that are kind of going in different directions. So the scale here, I think now I'll just turn this to like a 3, so that is pretty good. Now we want to plug this into the bump as well so that it looks like we have scratches. So this bump right here, I'm going to press shift D and just drop it right here. So now we have a duplicate bump. So now the factor, I can just plug this up to the height, and this one, it's already being converted to normal data through the height. So then the second one, the normal, will just go to the normal, and then this noise texture is going to go into the height. So that is how we can add multiple bump maps together. So we have this one right here, this is just the subtle one, and then I can control shift and click on this, and you can see there's those swirly bits added right there. Now it's very subtle, so I'm going to turn the strength of this one up to like a 0.3, so you can see it a lot more, but now it's just all over the place, and I don't really want that. I just want some different little parts that are scratchy, but most of it, I actually don't want it to be affecting it. So to do that, I can just take this color ramp, and I'll press shift D and just drop it down here, and then we can play around with the values to tell it where we want the scratches to be, but then the rest of it will be smooth. So I'm actually going to switch these back, and then I can just control shift and click on it to preview it. So I just want to put these very close together, so just something like that, so you can see that where the black values are, that's where the scratches are going to be, but then the white places, there's not going to be any scratches. So I just want to make a few scratches here and there, so that's why I'm pushing these two together very, very close. So now if I control shift and click on this, you can see that when I zoom in, there's only scratches here and there, but not all over the place. Now I think the scale is actually a little bit too small, so if I just turn this to maybe like a 1, that is a lot better. Now those scratches are a lot bigger, and there's not quite as many, so I can just control shift and click on this to see where the scratches are. Control shift and click on this, and then there we go. If you want to make the scratches a little bit more deep, you could turn up the strength here, but now I can just control shift and click on this, and there we go. So we have all these little random scratches here, there's like some there and some there, but they're all pretty random, which looks pretty nice. All right, so now I just want to add one more layer, I want to have some scratches which are just coming down. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for another wave texture. I'm just going to drop the wave texture down here, and then I will just plug the vector up to the vector right here. And I'm also just going to bring the texture coordinate and mapping down a little bit. All right, let's control shift and click on the wave texture to preview it, and then we can play around with the settings. So the scale, I'm going to turn this to like a 4, so there's not quite as many. I'll turn the distortion up to like a 4.5, something like that. So you can see the more you turn the distortion up, the more wiggly the lines are going to be. So however wiggly you want your scratches to be, you can turn the distortion up to make them more wiggly. All right, so this is going to be the texture for where these scratches are going to be, but I actually want to make a different texture for the details of the scratches. So I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a musgrave texture, and we'll just drop it down here. And then I can control shift and click on it to preview it. Now the scale, I think I'll turn this to like a 2 or a 3, something like that. And then I'll turn the detail up pretty high to maybe like a 14, so there is more detail. And then the dimension, I'll turn that to something like a 0.56. And you can see that now that we've turned that up, there is a bunch more detail here. That looks really great. All right, now this is a cool texture, but the problem with it is it doesn't actually have the scratch marks. So what we're going to do is we're going to tell the musgrave texture only to appear where the wave texture is. So how I'm going to do this is I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for a separate, and we're going to use the separate XYZ. So I'm just going to drop this right down here underneath the wave texture. And then the mapping here, I want to use the object mapping, so I'm going to plug this up to the vector right here. And then if you want to add a little dot in here, you can hold down the shift key and right click and drag over and then let go. And it's going to add this little dot in here. I just like this. And then that way this wire isn't going to be going over the wave texture. It won't change the node setup, but it looks a little bit nicer. So now what I want to do is press shift A, and I'm going to add a combine XYZ. So if I control shift and click on this, you can see here is the X, the Y, and the Z. So I want to combine them back up. So I'm going to take the Z and just plug that into the Z. The Y, plug that into the Y. Let me just move this over and bring this down. But then what I want to do, instead of using this Y1 and putting that into the Y, I want to add the wave texture in. So I'm going to take the color and put that into the Y. And there is the result that we get. So now we've added that wave texture in. So instead of using this object vector, if I control shift and click on this, we've created this new vector, and we're going to use this for the Musgrave texture instead. So you can see this is a purple one, and this is also a purple one because it's a vector. So we're going to plug this vector up to the Musgrave texture, and then I can control shift and click on it, and now you can see what's happening. So it's taking that Musgrave texture that we've added, but it's making these little streaks with it. So that is exactly what we want. Now, if we added this into the bump right now, there would be tons of scratches, and we don't want this many scratches. So we need to add a color ramp to tell it where we want the scratches to be because we only want some scratches here and there. So I'm going to press shift A, search for a color ramp. We're just going to drop the color ramp right in here, and then I can control shift and click on the color ramp to preview it, and I'm actually going to switch these. So I'm going to drag this one here and then drag the white one over here, and you can see that now that we've done that, if you drag this closer and closer, you can kind of sharpen that up. So if you want to bring it over here, there's going to be more scratches, or you can bring it really close, and there's only going to be a few scratches. So just play around with this. If you want a bunch of scratches, you could drag these both over. I just want a few scratches here and there, so I'm going to bring them over like that, and you can see now there's just a little bit of scratches here and there. So now that we have this scratches map, I can just add this into the bump. So the bump here, I'm going to click on this, press shift D to duplicate it. We'll just drop it down here, and then again, this is already converted to normal data, so it can just go through the normal, and we want to add this one. So the color is going to go into the height. So if I control shift and click on this, you can see here is the first bump. Control shift and click on this, and there is the second bump added with the little scratches here and there. And then I can control shift and click on this, and there is the third one. So now we have three layers of bump, and it makes it look a lot more interesting. And then if you want to play around with the strength, you can do that. So if you want to make these scratches a little bit stronger, you could do that. All right, I will control shift and click on this, and there we go. There is the finished material. Looks really cool. There's a lot of detail, which I really like. All right, I'll just render this out, and we can check out the final image. All right, there we go. That's the tutorial. That's how you create this procedural scratched metal shader.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkZ2L8etib4,Procedural Foil Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural foil texture in Blender. The process involves setting up a high-detail icosphere, adding lighting and a camera, and using a noise texture to create variations in color and texture. The Node Wrangler add-on is utilized to manipulate the texture coordinates and mapping for better distribution. The tutorial further details using a ColorRamp node to adjust the foil's colors and adding bump maps to simulate crumpled foil. The tutorial concludes by rendering the final image and encouraging viewers to support the channel through Gumroad and Patreon.","In this tutorial, we're going to be creating this procedural foil texture in Blender. Now, if you'd like to get the project files for this tutorial, as well as my other tutorials, and also help to support the channel, then you can do that over on my Gumroad and Patreon. The links are in the description. And then before we start, I wanted to show you the setup that I have. So I just have this icosphere, and I just subdivided it so that it's very high detail. And then I also have a plane light, and this is just going to give some lighting on the side of the sphere. And then I have a camera, and the camera's pointed right there at the sphere. And then also over here on the world, to get some very realistic lighting, I added this Photo Studio 01 1K HDR, and this is on HDRI Haven. I'll leave the link in the description if you'd like to download the same HDRI. And I just added this in as an environment texture. All right, let's get started with the procedural setup. All right, so I'm first going to hit the New button to add a new material, and I'm just going to call this Foil. I'm going to press Shift-A now, and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And I'm just going to add the noise texture right over here. So what I want to do is I just want to give a little bit of a variation in the color, just because I think it makes it look a little bit nicer. Now because this is foil, this is going to be metal, so the metallic value right here on the principled, I'm going to turn this all the way up to 1. And then I'm also going to turn this roughness value way down to like a 0.2 so that it's very shiny. All right, now this noise texture, I'm going to plug the color up to the base color, and you can see what it's doing. It's kind of making this light colored look. We don't really want this, but we will go ahead and change the colors in a moment. Now I'm going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on. It's a Blender add-on. It's built into Blender. If you don't have it enabled, you can go Edit, and then just go over here to the Preferences. And then right over here on the add-ons, you can just go up to the Search and start to type in Node. And you can see that there's this Node Wrangler add-on, so just checkmark that, and then we can use its features. And then we can just close the User Preferences. So now that we have that enabled, I can select this noise texture, and then I can press Ctrl-T, and that's going to add this texture coordinate and mapping. Now what I want to do is I want to take the object and plug that up instead of the generated, and that way the noise texture will be placed around the object more evenly. And then what I can also do is I can Ctrl-Shift-and-click on the noise texture, and that is a feature from the Node Wrangler. So Ctrl-Shift-and-click. I'm going to just Ctrl-Shift-and-click again so that we can preview the color, and we will be changing the colors in a moment, but I did just want to change some of these settings. So the scale, I'm going to turn this up pretty high to like a 50, so you can see it's very detailed. And then I'll also turn this detail all the way up to 16, and if you zoom way in, you can see it just adds a little bit more detail into the noise. So now what I want to do is I want to change the colors before it goes into the principled BSDF, because we don't really want these rainbow colors, we basically just want kind of like a gray kind of color. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a ColorRamp node. I'm just going to drop this ColorRamp node right in here, in between the connection, and then I can hold down the Ctrl-and-Shift-key-and-click on the ColorRamp to preview it. So you can see that basically it's just made up black and white. So we can take these tabs here, and we can add colors into them, and that way we'll be able to control what the colors are. So I'm going to click on this white tab, and this one, I'm going to make kind of a gray color, and then I'm going to make it a little bit blue. Now if you wanted to, you could make your colors kind of more of like a yellowish color, and kind of make it more like a gold-colored foil. I like foil that maybe looks slightly blue, so I'm going to do that. And then this one right here, the black one, I'm going to turn this up, it's still going to be gray, but it's going to be a lighter gray, and then I'm going to make it just slightly on the yellow side. I think that helps. And then also this color right here, I think just making it very, very slightly on the purplish side looks kind of cool. Of course, you can do whatever colors you want. But now I can Ctrl-Shift-and-click on this, and you can see what it looks like. So it's basically just this metal, but just adding a little bit of noise in there just gives a little bit more variation. All right, now it doesn't really look like foil right now, and that's because I'm trying to make that look of like foil that's been kind of crumpled up a little bit. If foil was like super smooth, it might look like that, but I want to make kind of a crumpled foil look. So to do that, we're going to add some bump into our normal, and then that'll make it look like it's kind of bumpy, and it will make it look like it's been crumpled a little bit. So what I'm going to do is actually take this noise texture, and I'm going to press Shift-D and just bring it down, and then we will plug the vector up to the vector here, and we could also just bring these down, they're going to center them. Now I can Control-Shift and click on this one to preview it, and we can change this up a bit. So the scale, this is a little bit high, I just want to turn it down to like a 10, so that those bumps are a little less big. And then the detail, this is way too high, so I'm going to turn this down to like a 3, so that it still has some detail, but not as much. So this noise texture, I'm going to use this just to give it little bits of crumples, and then below this we're going to make another texture, and have that be some bigger bumps, and we'll add them together. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the factor, and I'm going to plug this into the normal to just give it a little bit of bump. Now if I Control-Shift and click on this, you can see that doesn't look good, and that's because we need to convert this to normal data. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a bump node. We'll just drop the bump node right here, and then the factor here, we want to plug this up to the height, because we're just converting this through the gray, and then it's converting it to normal data, so it's coming out here as purple, and then that can go into the normal. So there we go, it's starting to look better, but the strength is way too high, and for this one I think something like a 0.1 is pretty good, so you can see it's definitely starting to look like foil now, there's just a little bit of detail there that is pretty good. Now I want to actually duplicate this one more time, because I want to add some bigger lumps, kind of like it's been crumpled a lot, and there are like some bigger bumps as well as these little bits, so this noise texture I'm going to press Shift-D and duplicate it one more time, we'll just drop it down here, and then I'll plug the vector up to the vector here. Now I'm going to Control-Shift and click on this one to preview it, now this one, because I want those bumps to be even bigger, the scale, I'm just going to turn to like a 5 so that there's even bigger bumps, and then the detail, I think I'll just turn this to like a 2, but the distortion, I'm going to turn this up to like a 0.3, just so that there's a little bit of distortion, you can see what that's doing, it's kind of just making it kind of a little bit swirly, so now I just need to add this in, so what I'm going to do is take this bump and I'll press Shift-D to duplicate it, I'm just going to drop it down here, and then we want to add this noise texture into the bump along with this one. So if I Control-Shift and click on this one, you can see here is 1, but then we want to add this one in with it. So this first bump has already converted this to normal data, so that means this color, or this normal, can go right in here to the normal, because it's already been converted, but this one we need to convert this to normal data. So we're going to take this one, the factor, we're going to put that into the height, and then it adds this one and converts this one into normal data, so now you can see we have this one, and then we have a second layer of bump. And for this one, the strength, I'm going to turn this up to like a .5, so it's a lot stronger. So you can see there is our first layer, and then there is our second layer of bump, we're adding them together, and then that's going into the normal. So I can now Control-Shift and click on this, and we can preview the final material. And then if you wanted to give everything a little bit more detail, or scale it down a little bit, all of these noise textures are plugged up to this mapping, so what you can do is just change the scale, and then that's going to make the texture bigger or smaller. So to change all these at once, you can click on the first one, drag down, and then you can drag back and forth, and you can see that it's going to change all the values at the same time. You can also hold down the Shift key to make your movements more sensitive, and then if you want to just scale the foil up, just give it a little bit more detail, or make it a little bit smaller or bigger, you can do that. Alright, I will just press F12 now to render out the final image. Alright, there we go, so there is the procedural foil material. Thank you for watching, I hope this video was helpful, and I will see you in a future video."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXZtuPVTU6o,Procedural Gold Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make two variations of procedural gold material: a smooth gold material suitable for items like crowns or jewelry, and a gold nugget material that mimics the appearance of unrefined gold. The tutorial covers setting up the scene with Blender's add-ons and using various textures and nodes to achieve the desired effects. Additionally, the video includes a segment thanking the sponsor, Sketchfab, and offers links to download project files via Gumroad and Patreon. The video emphasizes the importance of adjusting textures and lighting to achieve realistic results in 3D rendering.","In this blender tutorial, we're going to be creating this procedural gold material. Now we're actually going to be creating two different variations of this gold material. So the first one is this like smooth gold material and this is for like a golden object, like maybe a golden crown or some kind of jewelry or something. But then I also wanted to make like a gold nugget material, like, you know, like in a gold mine. If someone's mining for gold, maybe they find like a gold nugget or something. So I wanted to make that as well. So we're going to create this gold nugget material and then we're also going to create this smooth gold material. And if you'd like to download the project files for this tutorial and also help to support me, then you can do that over on my Gumroad and Patreon with the links in the video description. And real quick before we start, I wanted to thank this video's sponsor, Sketchfab. Sketchfab is an awesome 3D model site where you can upload, buy, and sell 3D models and assets. What I love about Sketchfab is that you can upload and preview your 3D models in your browser and even view them on a phone or tablet. Sketchfab also has a 3D model store where you can purchase assets for your 3D work. Check out Sketchfab with the links in the description. Now before we get started, I wanted to show you the setup that I have for the blend file. So what I did is I just pressed Shift-A and I went to Mesh and I just added an Icosphere. And then you can't see it right behind me. If you click on the little Add Icosphere, this thing will pop up and the subdivisions. I have this set to 6 so that it's very smooth. You can see now it's very, very smooth. And then I just close these Icosphere settings. And then I also just shade this object smooth. So that's what I use for the smooth gold material. I'm just going to bring this over to the side. But this wouldn't look very good on a gold nugget because a gold nugget's going to kind of be like chunky and lumpy. So what I did for that is I actually went to Edit and then I went to Preferences. And then right over here on Add-ons, if you just search for Extra, you can see there's this Add Mesh Extra Objects. And it's built into Blender so you can just checkmark that. And then if you want it to be in all your future Blender projects, you can click on the Save Preferences or the Auto Save Preferences might already be turned on. And then while we're here, I'm also going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on when we're setting up the material. So if you just want to click right here and start typing in Node, you can turn on the Node Wrangler add-on. Just checkmark that. We're going to be using that when we're setting up the nodes. Okay, so I'm going to close this now. So now that that add-on is enabled, I'm going to press Shift-A. And you can see that there is all these extra objects here because we added the Extra Objects add-on. But the one that I'm looking for is this Rock Generator. So you can just click on the Rock Generator. This is really cool. It helps you to make rocks really quickly. And then I'm just going to move myself over so you can see this a little bit better. So right here, there's the Add Rocks. Right when you add this object, if you don't move it, there should be this Add Rocks tab. If you click on that, then there's going to be a bunch of different settings here that you can play around with. So you can just play around with these different settings here. So there's the X Scale, Y Scale. So this is designed to make rocks, but it works really well for a gold nugget. So I'm just going to play around with the scale, kind of get a rock that I want. And then I'm going to turn off the Use Random Seed because that way it won't be just randomly making tons of rocks. And then I'm just going to click through these seeds. So you see it says right here, User Seed. I'm just going to click through these until I find a rock that I kind of like. Something like that is pretty good. And then you can also play around with the Roughness. And then the Detail Level and Display Detail. I'm going to turn these both up to 4 so that it's very high detail. And then just play around with some of these settings. It's a little bit laggy, so I might want to turn the Display and Detail Levels down. And then you can just play around with these settings here. All right, so this is what I've created just by playing around with these settings. But you can actually play around with this even more. If you just close this, you can tab into Edit Mode and you can see that it's actually using modifiers. So if you click right over here, you can see it's using a bunch of different modifiers in Blender. So you can go ahead and edit these even more. And we tabbed into Edit Mode. You can see that because it's using all those modifiers, this is actually very simple. So you can just click on the vertices and just pull them around and you can change the shape of your gold nugget. So I want it to be more of an even shape. So I'm just going to click on these vertices and just kind of pull them around until I get the shape that I like. All right, that is looking pretty good. And then also if it's a little bit too laggy for you, you could turn the viewport down here on the subsurf. You could just turn that down if you wanted to. I'm just going to leave it up. And then there's also a bunch of displacement maps. So if you want to play around with the strength, you could do that. And that will affect the look of the gold nugget as well. All right, so those are my two gold objects. Now as well as that, I added a camera and I just pointed the camera right at the objects. And then I also added these two plane lights. So I'm using the Cycles render engine. So I just had these two plane lights. So I just added planes and then added the emission material. And then these lights are both pointed at the objects. So this back one here kind of gives a nice rim light to the objects. And then this is kind of a main light. And then I also added in an HDRI to get some even more realistic lighting. So if you go over to the world here, I added in this AutoShop 0.1.1k HDR. And this is on HDRI Haven. So I'll leave a link in the video description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. And I just added this into the world as an environment texture. So just add that in to get some more realistic lighting. All right, so with that out of the way now, let's go ahead and make our material. So first, I'm going to make the gold nugget material. And then after that, we will duplicate the material and then change it to make the smooth gold material. So I'm just going to click on New right here. I'm going to call this Gold Nugget. And then right over here, here's the principled BSDF. So the first thing that I'm going to do, because this is a metal material, I'm going to turn the metallic all the way to 1. So it's shiny and looks more like a metal material. Now the roughness here, I'm going to turn this down to somewhere around a 0.38. I find that works pretty well. So it's a bit more shiny, but it doesn't look like gold right now. What I want to do is just add a little bit of a texture in for the gold color. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a Musgrave texture. So you can see right here, Musgrave texture. Just drop this in here. And then with the Musgrave texture selected, I'm going to press Control-T. And that's using one of the features from the Node Wrangler add-on that we added in at the beginning of the tutorial. And then on the texture coordinate, this object right here, I'm going to plug this into the vector. And then again, using another feature from the Node Wrangler add-on, if I hold down the Control and Shift key and click on the Musgrave texture, we can preview what it's doing. So by plugging the object into the mapping, it's going to place the texture around the object more evenly. Now the scale here, I'm going to change this up to like 400. You can see now it's nice and detailed. And then the detail here, I'm going to turn this up to 16, which is the max, so it's nice and detailed. And then this dimension right here, I'm going to turn this down to zero because I find it looks a little bit better without it. All right, let's take the height here, and we're going to plug this up to the base color. And then if I Control-Shift and click on this, you can see what it's looking like. So it doesn't really look like gold right now. It just kind of is black and white. So what I want to do is I want to add a ColorRamp node to tell it what colors we want to have instead of black and white. So I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to add a ColorRamp node. Just drop this right down here. And then you can hold down the Control and Shift key and click on this node to preview what it's looking like. Now this black here, I'm going to click on this tab, and I'm going to change it to a full white and then just kind of make it a yellowish-orangish color. This is going to be the main gold color, so just make it whatever you like. I kind of like it in between yellow and orange and not too saturated, so I like to kind of keep it back kind of up here more. And then if you'd like to use the exact same color that I'm using, you can click right over here to the hex value, and then I'm going to add in CD9D52. And then over here on this white one, if I click on the white tab, this one I'm going to make a very similar material, but it's going to be a bit more brown and a bit darker. And again, if you'd like to use the same color that I'm using, you can click over on the hex value, and then you can type in 90582C. So now if you zoom in here, you can see that it has that lighter and then darker kind of yellowish-brownish-orangish colors. So now I can Ctrl-Shift and click on this, and that definitely looks like gold. But because this is a gold nugget material, it needs to be all lumpy and bumpy like a gold nugget, and it is a little bit, but I want to add some normal map to make it even bumpier. So to do this, I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for the noise texture and just add this right down here. And then the vector, I'm going to plug the vector up to the vector here on the noise texture. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and click on this to preview what it's looking like. The scale here, I think I'll turn to something like 10. And then the detail here, I'm going to turn this up to 8. Also, the roughness, I'm going to turn this down just a little bit to 0.45. And then this factor here, I'm going to plug the factor into the normal. Now, we need to convert this to normal data. You can see this is a gray one and this is a purple one. The purple means that it's using the normal. So we need to convert that. So to convert it to normal data, I'm going to press Shift-A here, search for a bump node and just drop the bump node right in here. And then we actually want to plug the factor up to the height. So now if I Ctrl-Shift and click on this, you can see what it looks like, nice and bumpy. And if I Ctrl-Shift and click on this, you can see there is our gold nugget. Now, that bump is really strong. So I'm going to change this down to like a 0.5 here on the bump. You could turn it down even more if you like. I find that 0.5 looks pretty good. So there we go. That is our gold nugget material. I think it looks pretty cool. But let's go ahead and make our shiny gold material. So I'm just going to select our other sphere here and then click right up here and I'm going to add the gold nugget material. Now, I don't want to use the same material. You can see that doesn't really look very nice, especially for a smooth gold material. So right here, you can see it looks like two papers. I'm going to click that and that's going to copy the material. So now it's a separate material and it says gold nugget 001. I'm going to call it gold smooth. Okay, gold smooth. So there's just a few things I'm going to change. The first thing I'm going to do is unplug the normal and you can see that now it's a lot smoother, but it's actually not very shiny. I want it to be more shiny. So I'm going to turn this roughness down to make it more shiny. And I find that a 0.27 actually looks really good. I don't know why this happens, but if you look right up close here, you can see that it's very speckly and shiny and I really like that. I think it looks really good for gold. If you turn the roughness slightly up though, you can see that kind of goes away, but anywhere underneath that, you can see that it's really speckly and shiny. If anyone knows why that happens, definitely let me know in the comments, but I found that 0.27 looks pretty good and you can see there's just a little bit of speckles right there and it looks really nice for a gold material. So you could call that done if you wanted to, but when I was looking at reference images of like gold bars, it seems to have a tiny, tiny little bit of noise just because, you know, everything in the real world isn't super perfect and super smooth. They're just a little bit of bumps and stuff on most objects. So I'm actually going to plug this back into the normal and then the scale here, I'm going to turn this maybe up to like a 12 just so it's a little bit more detailed. And then the detail here, I'm going to turn this all the way up to 16, but then the strength here, this is way too high. So I'm going to turn this way down. I'm actually going to turn this way down to a 0.008. So it's very, very subtle. But if I just zoom in here, you can see it's just adding a tiny little bit of noise and it just makes it look a little bit nicer. So here's without it. You can see it's kind of smooth and then here it is with it and you can see it's very subtle, but it adds a tiny little bit of bump and just kind of helps to give it a little bit more detail. So there we go. There are the materials. I'm just going to render this out and show you the final result. All right, there we go. So there is the finished gold materials and you can especially see right here in the render on this smooth one, adding that little bit of noise just adds a tiny little bit of noise there and I think it looks quite nice.

Before we get started, I wanted to show you the setup that I have. So I just added a sphere and just stuck that in the middle of the scene and then I added a camera and pointed it right at the sphere. And then I'm using Cycles Render Engine, so I just added these two planes here and then added emission materials to them to light up the scene. And then to get some even more realistic lighting, I added this AutoShop 01 1K HDR on HDRI Haven. So if you'd like to download and use the same HDRI that I'm using, I'll leave a link in the description to this HDRI. And I just downloaded the 1K version and then I added this here into the world as an environment texture. And then one more thing before we get started, I'm going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you don't have that enabled, it's really easy to enable. You can just go edit and then go to the preferences. And then on the add-ons here, you can just start typing in node and then just click on the Node Wrangler add-on right here and just check mark that. All right, so I have the 3D view right here and I'm in rendered mode so that we can preview the material as we create it. And then right over here is my shader nodes. So I'm just going to click on the new button right here and I'm going to call this leather. So we're first going to start off by adding a Voroni texture. So I'm going to press shift A, start searching for a Voroni texture and just add it in. And then using one of the features from the Node Wrangler, if you hold down the control and shift key and click on a node, it's going to add this viewer node right here and that will allow us to preview what the node is looking like. And then using another feature from the Node Wrangler, I'm going to make sure this is selected and then I'm going to press control T and control T is going to add this texture coordinate and mapping. And what I want to do is I want to plug the object into the mapping. And what that's going to do is it's going to place that texture around the object more evenly. Now on this Voroni texture, I'm going to click on this F1 here and I'm going to change this to distance to edge. And you can see when we do that, it adds all these little lines here and it kind of makes these little cracked pieces. And this is what we're going to use for our leather texture. And then the scale here, I'm going to turn this up to something around 30. I think that looks pretty good. Now if I zoom way in here, you can see that all these lines here, they're very straight and they don't look very organic. So I want to make them just a little bit wobbly so they look more organic. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a noise texture and I'm going to drop it right in here between the mapping and the Voroni texture. And you can see what it's doing. It's making it all warpy. I want to turn the detail all the way up to 16 so that it has a lot more detail, but you can see that it's kind of warping it a little too much. Those little cracked bits, you can't really even tell that they're there. So what I want to do is have this affect the Voroni texture, but only have it affect it a little bit. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a mix RGB and just drop the mix RGB right here. And then this vector, I'm going to plug this up to color 2 and then this noise texture is going to go into color 1. So this mix RGB node, this factor here, this is going to determine whether it's using color 1 or color 2. Right now it's at 0.5 so it's just mixing them in between evenly. So if I turn this all the way to 0, you can see it's only going to be using the noise texture and it's very distorted. If I turn this all the way to 1, it's not going to be using the noise texture at all. I'm just going to go straight through to the Voroni texture. But I want these lines just to be a little bit wobbly. So if I just turn this down slightly, you can see that now it's just starting to affect those lines a little bit and making them a little bit wobbly. So I think that something around 0.9 looks pretty good. And there we go. Now it just looks a lot more organic. Now I want this Voroni texture to be affecting the bump because I want these little parts where the lines are to be going in. So this distance here, I'm going to plug it into the normal of the principled BSDF. Now if we control shift and click on this, something is wrong with our shading and that's because we haven't converted this to data that the normal can use. Because you can see this is a gray dot and this is a purple dot. The purple dot means that it's using normal data. So to convert it, I need to add a node right in here. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a bump node and the bump node will convert that data. So I'm just going to drop it right in here. And then I don't want this to be plugging up to the normal because if you were going to use a normal map, I want to convert it to a normal map. So I'm going to plug it into the height. And now you can see that it's actually turning that into normal data. And then the base color here, I think I'll just turn this down to a kind of a gray color so you can see it a little bit better. So if I control shift and click on this bump, you can see that it's kind of making these little almost like mountains if you're like looking down on it. If you control shift and click on the Voroni texture, you can see where the center of those little cracked pieces are. It's kind of bumping up a lot. And I don't really want this because I just want the cracks to be going in, but then I want the rest of it to be pretty flat. So to flatten that out, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Just drop the color ramp right in here. And then I can just take this white one and I can start to pull it out. And you can start to see what it's doing. You can see that it's flattening the tops of those little bumps. And if I just flatten that down and just keep on flattening it, just bring it way down so it's pretty close, something around there. You can see that now most of it is actually flat, but just those little cracks are going in. And if I control shift and click on it, you can see what it's doing. So now most of it's white. You can see if I drag that out, it's kind of getting more gray. So wherever it's white, it's going to be flat. And then where the black is, it's kind of going to be going in. So now I can control shift and click back on the Principled BSDF and you can see that looks a lot more like leather. Now the strength here on the bump is a little bit high. So I'm going to click on the strength and change this to somewhere around 0.4. And I think that looks a lot better. All right. So we don't really have any color data. So let's go ahead and do that. So I'm actually going to click on this noise texture and press shift D to duplicate it and just bring it up here. And then again, I want to be using the object coordinates. So this vector here, I'm going to plug this up to the vector on this noise texture as well. And then I can control shift and click on this to preview the texture. The scale here, I'm going to turn this up to around 30. And then I want to add a little bit of roughness. So I'm going to change this up just a little bit to about 0.65, somewhere around there. And then the distortion, I want to add just a little bit of distortion. So I'm going to change the distortion to around 0.3. I think that just makes it look a little more interesting. And then let's plug the factor up to the base color. And then I can control shift and click on this principle. So it isn't really looking like leather right now because it's just black and white. So I'm going to put a note in here to tell it what colors I want to use. So I'm going to press shift A and search for another color ramp and just drop the color ramp right in here. And now I can just add the colors that I want to be in the texture. So I'm first going to drag this out and I'm just going to drag the black value to somewhere around here. You can see the position that I'm at. So I'm at 0.209. You don't have to put yours exactly where I'm putting mine, but that can help you to know where I'm putting mine exactly. So I'm going to click on this black value here because I don't want to use black. I want to make this a light brown color. So I'm just going to change this to something around there. And actually let's control shift and click on the color ramp so that we can preview what it's looking like. I want to make this color a little less saturated. So I'm going to bring it more towards the center and then just make it a little bit brighter. All right. Now the white tab, I'm going to click on it and just kind of drag it out, bring it to somewhere around here. And then I'm going to click on this and I'm going to make it a dark brown color. All right. Something like that, a pretty dark brown. And then I want to have one more brown material or one more brown color. So I'm going to click on the plus here and that'll add a new tab and it adds it right in the middle. That's what we want. Now this color, I'm going to make it a darker brown, but not super dark. And I also want it to be a little more saturated. So I'm going to drag it more out. You can see that adds more saturation, just something like that. And then I can control shift and click on this to see what it's looking like. So the color doesn't really have anything to do with the bump and I kind of want them to work with each other. So where it kind of goes in, I want that to be a little bit brighter. And then where it's out here, kind of the parts that bump out, I want that to be a little bit darker. So to do this, I'm going to mix the color with the Voronoi texture. So I'm going to press shift A. I'm going to search for a mix RGB, just drop the mixed RGB right here. And then I'm going to plug this distance up to color two. So now if I control shift and click on the color ramp, you can see what it's doing, or I can control shift and click on the mix here. And you can see that it's adding this one and this one together. Now I don't want this to be on mix. I want to turn this to add. So I'm going to change this to add and then the factor, I'm going to turn this all the way up to one so that you can see those cracks from the Voronoi texture a little bit better. So now if I control shift and click on the color ramp, you can see that where those cracks are, you can see that it's actually a little bit lighter. And then where those big pieces are, those flat pieces, it's actually darker. So I can now control shift and click on this and preview the material. Now the roughness here, I'm going to change this to somewhere around a 0.4, just so that it's a little bit more shiny. All right, so this is looking pretty cool. But if I zoom in here, especially where the light is shining on the material, you can see that it's very, very flat and smooth. And I just want to add a little bit of roughness around the entire material. So I'm actually going to use this noise texture and put it through the bump. So I'm going to click on this bump, press shift to duplicate it and just drop it right here. And then this noise texture, I'm going to take the factor and plug it up to the height of the second bump. So now we're mixing two bump nodes together. If I control shift and click on this, you can see that we're mixing them together. But right now this bump is way too strong. So I'm going to click on the strength and change this to about a 0.1. And you can see that now instead of it being super smooth, if I click on this and press M, that's going to mute the node, M is for mute. You can see that those chunks right there are very smooth. But if I press M now to unmute that, you can see it's very subtle, but it does have just a little bit more detail, a little bit more roughness. So now I can control shift and click on this and you can see adding that little bit of detail does really make it look more interesting. And then one last thing that I'm going to change really quick, this color ramp right here, the white value. If I zoom way in, you can see the size of the cracks. I think I want those cracks to be just a tiny bit bigger. So I'm going to drag this white value out a tiny bit and that's going to make those cracks just a tiny bit bigger. I think it just helps to make the material look a little bit better. All right, so there we go. There is the final leather material. I'm just going to render this out and show you the final result. All right, and there we go. There is the procedural leather material. Now, if you'd like to help support me and also get the project files for my tutorials, then you can do that over on my Gumroad and Patreon with the links in the video description.

Huge thank you to this video's sponsor, Sketchfab. Upload, buy, and sell 3D models and assets on Sketchfab.

Be sure to check out Sketchfab with the links in the description. Now before we get started with this tutorial, I wanted to show you the setup that I have. So I just added a sphere and just added it in the center of the scene, and then I also just added a camera and pointed it right at the sphere. And then I also have these two planes, so I just made these two planes, scaled them up, and I added an emission material, and that way they give some nice lighting to the sphere. And then just to get some even more realistic lighting, I added this Wooden Lounge 1K HDRI on HDRI Haven. So if you'd like to add in the same HDRI that I'm using, I'll add the link in the video description so you can download it. And I just downloaded the 1K version, and then I added this in here into the world as an environment texture. And that way it just gives the material a little more realistic lighting. And then one last thing before we get started, I am going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on, so if you don't have that enabled, then you can go right up here to Edit, and then go to the Preferences, and then just click on the Add-ons tab, and then right here on the search, you can start typing in Node, and you can see that there is this Node Wrangler add-on. So it's built into Blender, so you can just checkmark that, and then close it, and I'll show you what the add-on does in a moment. So I have my shader nodes right here, and then I also have the sphere in rendered mode so that we can see the material as we create it. So let's just click on this new button right here, and I'm going to call this Plaster. So I'm going to start off by pressing Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a Voronoi texture, and just add it in right here. And then using a feature from the Node Wrangler, I'm going to press Control-T with this selected, this texture here, and it's going to add this texture coordinate and mapping. And then what I like to do is I like to change this to the object coordinates, and that way this Voronoi texture is going to be placed around your object a little bit more evenly. And then using another feature from the Node Wrangler, I'm going to hold down the Control and Shift key and click on this Voronoi texture to preview what it's looking like. And then I'm going to change this right here, I'm going to change this to Manhattan, and I find that looks a bit better for what we're doing. Now right now this does not look like plaster, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to press Shift-A, and I'm going to search for a noise texture, and I'm actually going to drop this noise texture in between the mapping and the vector of the Voronoi texture. And you can see it's using that noise texture to kind of distort the texture and make it all wobbly and swirly. Also on this noise texture, I'm going to change the detail all the way up to 16, so that it has a lot more detail. Now the scale is way too big right now, so right here on the Voronoi texture, the scale, I'm going to change this up to somewhere around 30. And you can see that is starting to look a lot more like a dry plaster wall material. All right, so let's Control-Shift and click back on this principled VSDF, and then I'm just going to take the distance right here and plug the distance into the base color. And now you can see that color on our object. Now it's way too white right now, so I want to make it much more gray. So I'm going to press Shift-A here, and I'm going to search for a color ramp node, and just drop the color ramp node right in here between these two connections. And then I'm going to bring this out, and I'm going to make it a gray color. And I'm just going to make this kind of a mid-gray color, sort of on the lighter side. And then this white one, I'm going to bring it out a little bit as well. And I'm going to make this a gray color. Very similar, but just a little bit darker. So I just want this to be a tiny bit darker. So you can see now that one part of our material is a little bit lighter, and then the other part is just a little bit darker. Now this really isn't looking like a plaster wall or a plaster material. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the distance right here on the Voronoi texture and plug this into the normal to give it some bump. Now you can see that the shading gets all messed up, and that's because we need to convert this to normal data. So to convert it, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to click on the search and search for a bump node. Just drop the bump node right in here, and that way it's going to convert this black and white texture into something that the bump can actually understand. So it goes through here, and we actually need to plug this up to the height. And you can see that now it converts it to normal data. And if I control shift and click on the principal BSDF, you can actually see now it actually looks like it's bumping out. The problem with this though is that it's very detailed and bumping out all over the place. I want to make it so that it only bumps out in some certain small areas. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for another color ramp node, and just drop the color ramp node right in here before the bump. Then I can hold down the control and shift key and click on the color ramp, and you can see it's not really doing anything. But if we drag these values, you can see it's going to make it more and more contrasty. So the white parts are going to be even more white, and the black parts are going to be even more black. So what this is going to do is it's going to make the black parts the bumpy parts, and then the white part is going to be very smooth. So wherever it's white, it'll just be very smooth. So I'm just going to change this to something like that, and now if I control shift and click on this, you can see that it's pretty smooth most of the place, but then there's those little bumpy parts where the black is. So this bump is actually kind of boring, and I don't want it to be smooth all over the place, because it seems like like dry plaster walls are usually have a little bit of bump all over the place. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on this noise texture, press shift to duplicate it, just bring it down here. And then the vector, I'm going to plug this up to the vector right here, and that way it'll be using this object mapping. All right, I'm going to control shift and click on this and see what it's looking like. So what I want to do is I want this noise texture to be affecting the bump. So I'm going to click on this bump, press shift to duplicate it, and drop it right over here to add another one. And then this factor, I'm going to plug it up to the height. So now if I control shift and click on it, you can see what it's doing, and it's way too strong right now. So I'm going to change the strength here to like a 0.2, and you can see that it's still there, but it's a lot more subtle. And then also the strength on the first one, so those little kind of bumps right there, I'm going to change this to around 0.5, so it's not quite as strong. So now you can see that's our normal, it's looking pretty cool, and there's lots of detail. If I control shift and click on this now, you can see it has a lot more detail and looks pretty cool. So this is looking pretty good, but the color is a little bit boring. I want to actually have this noise texture be affecting the color as well, and that way there will be some little patches where some parts are a little bit lighter and some parts are a little bit darker. So what I'm going to do is press shift A here, and I'm going to just search for a mix RGB, and drop the mix RGB right here after the Voronoi texture. Then this noise texture here, I can plug the factor up to color 2, and then this is going to be going from distance into color 1. So now if I control shift and click on this, you can see that it just has some slight variation, so some parts are a little bit lighter and some parts are a little bit darker. You can see this is it before with just the Voronoi texture, and then this is it after, and it also makes everything a little bit more gray and just kind of mixes them together. Then if I control shift and click on the color ramp, it changes the colors and kind of makes it those gray color, and you can definitely see that right over there it's a little bit darker, and there's some little parts right there where it gets a little bit lighter. So now I can control shift and click on this, and preview the final material. So let's go ahead and render this, and I'll show you the final result. And there we go, there is the finished plaster material.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTMdF6lOOsw,Procedural Rusty Metal (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor guides viewers through the creation of a procedural rusty metal material. The tutorial involves setting up a scene with a sphere and HDRI lighting, and using Blender's Node Wrangler add-on to create and mix two shaders: a metal shader and a rusty shader. The instructor demonstrates how to adjust various parameters such as color, roughness, and bump mapping to achieve the desired appearance of rust on metal. The tutorial also covers organizing shader nodes using frames and provides tips for fine-tuning the material's look. Links to project files and support options are available in the video description.","In this Blender tutorial we're going to be creating this procedural rusty metal material. Now if you'd like to help support me and also get the project files for this tutorial, then you can do that over on my Gumroad and Patreon with the links in the video description. Now before we get started I just wanted to show you the setup that I have. So I just have a sphere right here in the center of the scene and then I just added a camera and pointed it right at the sphere. And then for the lighting I also added this Photo Studio 01 1K HDR and this is on HDRI Haven so I'll leave a link in the video description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. So I just added this in as an environment texture in the world and then just added this HDRI. So right over here I'm going to go into rendered mode just so that we can see the preview of the material as we create it. And then right over here are our shader nodes. So I'm just going to click on new and I'm going to call this material rusty metal. And then one more thing before we get started I am going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on so if you don't have that enabled you can go to edit and then go to preferences and then right over here on the add-ons you can just go to the search here and start searching for a node and then just check mark this Node Wrangler add-on. So this add-on is built into Blender so you can just check mark that and then I'll show you how we're going to use it while we're setting up this material. So we're going to be creating two different shaders. We're going to create the metal shader and then we're also going to create the rusty shader and then we're going to mix them together and tell Blender where we want the rusty parts to be and where we want the metal parts to be. So let's go ahead and make the metal first. So what I'm going to do is turn this metallic all the way to one and you can see that that already looks more shiny and looks more like metal. Now I want to make the base color kind of a gray color so I'm just going to turn it down make it a gray color but you can really make it any metal material that you want. I'm just going to go with gray and then the roughness here I'm going to change this to somewhere around a 0.25 so 0.25 and you can see that now that metal is a lot more shiny and I think it looks a bit nicer. So the metal is really smooth right now but I want to add just a very very tiny bit of bump or warping just to make it a little more realistic. So to do that I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Just drop the noise texture right down here and then using a feature with the Node Wrangler add-on if I have this selected and then press ctrl t that's going to add this mapping and texture coordinate. Now from generated I actually want to change this to object so I'm going to plug the object into the vector mapping right here and that way the noise texture is going to be placed around your object a little bit better and then using another feature from the Node Wrangler you can hold down the ctrl and shift key and click on nodes and then it's going to give a preview of what that node looks like. So I want this scale to be a little bit smaller so I'm just going to change it to maybe around a 6 just that we have a little bit more detail and then I'm going to plug the factor into the normal. Now when we do that if I now ctrl shift and click on the principle to preview it you can see that it's black and that's because we need to convert this to normal data because you can see this is a gray circle whereas this is a purple circle and so this needs to be converted to data that the normal can use. So to convert this to normal data I need to press shift a and I'm going to search for a bump node. I'm just going to drop the bump node right here and then we don't want it to go into the normal we want this to go into the height. Now you can see that it looks like the metal is really bumpy. Now it's way too bumpy right now I just want to make it very subtle. So the strength here I'm going to turn this way down to something like a 0.015 so very very subtle but if you look really up close you can see that it's just a little bit warpy whereas if I just unplug this you can see without that's just kind of smooth and simple. It's very subtle but it just adds a little bit more detail makes it slightly warpy. So that's going to be it for our metal material I think that looks pretty good. So what we could do is we could actually join these together in a frame. This is totally optional you don't have to do this if you don't want to but I thought it'd be pretty cool to do in the tutorial. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a frame just drop the frame right here and then what we can do is we can actually add nodes in this frame and it'll just make it kind of easier to kind of move it around. Now this texture coordinate and mapping I want to use this for other textures that we're going to be using later on in the video. So I'm actually going to drag these two up here but then I'm going to box select all these three nodes and I'm going to drag them and drop them inside the frame. Now if I click on the frame I can drag it around it's going to drag all these nodes around and then right now it says frame but we can actually edit what this is called. So if you press n that's going to open up this side panel here and if you select the frame you can see it has a name and a label. I'm going to call this metal and then I'm going to also make the label metal as well. So now you can see that it says metal right there and we can kind of drag this around. So using frames is just a really great way to keep your nodes organized but it's totally optional. You don't have to use it if you don't want to. If you want to you can just select it and delete it. I just like using it sometimes to organize my nodes but it's not going to change the look of the node setup. All right so we've made the metal material now I want to make the rusty material before we add them together. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for another principal bsdf and I'm just going to drop it right here and then again I'm going to press shift a and add a noise texture. I'm just going to drop the noise texture behind this principal and then again I want this mapping to be plugged up to this noise texture because I want it to be using the object coordinates. So now I can control shift and click on this noise texture to preview what it's looking like. Now the scale here I'm going to turn this up to like 60 because I want it to be very small and then the detail I'm going to turn this all the way up to 16 because I want it to be pretty detailed and then the roughness I found that something like a 0.6 looks pretty good just adds a little more roughness. Okay let's take the factor and plug this into the base color and then control shift and click on the principled. So you can see that it doesn't really look like rust because it's just white and gray so what we need to do is add a node in here to edit the colors and tell it what kind of colors we want to have. So to do this I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. I'm just going to drop the color ramp node right here and now we can go ahead and edit these tabs. We can also slide the tabs around. So I'm also going to control shift and click on the color ramp just so that we can preview what that's seeing. So I'm going to take this black tab and just kind of drag it out just to make there be a little bit more black. You can see the more I drag it out the more black is there's going to be so I'm just going to give it a little bit more black. So I'm just going to bring it to somewhere around there that's pretty fine and then this I'm going to click on the white tab and I'm going to bring this out a little bit as well. Now this one I kind of want to be a light brown so I'm going to click on this tab right here and that's going to bring up the colors and I'm going to bring this down kind of to the orange and then make it a lot darker so that way it's kind of a nice light brown color. Not super saturated you can see if I bring it up here it's a lot less saturated whereas if I bring it down here it's going to be way more saturated so a little bit desaturated just kind of a light brown something like that. Okay now I want to add another tab in here and I want to make this one a little bit more of a reddish brownish so I'm going to click on the plus right here and that's going to add a new tab. I'm just going to bring the tab a little bit closer over here and then I'm just going to click on the colors and this one I want to be slightly more red so I'm going to pull this a little bit more towards the red because I found that rust does usually have a little bit of red it's kind of a brownish reddish color so I thought that would look nice if we just added a little bit more of a red color it's still pretty brown but just a tiny bit of red and then you can just kind of make it a dark color. Okay so if you look at it you can see this is what mine looks like and I think that looks pretty good so now I'm going to ctrl shift and click on the principle then you can see what it's doing. Now right now it doesn't really look like rust but if I click on the color and drag it into the normal it's going to add a lot more bump and we'll make it look a lot more like rust. Now again we need to convert this to normal data so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for another bump node and just drop the bump node right here and then we don't want to plug this up to normal we want to plug it up to height and then it will convert it to normal data and now you can see that's bumping out and it looks a lot better. Now it's way too strong right now so the strength here I'm going to change this to like a 0.16 I think that looks a lot better and now you can zoom in here and you can see that there still is bump but it's a lot more subtle. All right now one more thing I do want to adjust the roughness because you can see there's this roughness value here I'm going to take the color and plug it into the roughness. Now when I do that you can see it makes everything really shiny so I'm going to actually edit those colors to make it a lot less shiny. So I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for another color ramp and I'm just going to drop the color ramp right in here. Now when I drop it in it doesn't really do anything but I'm going to actually switch these so if I pull this out and then pull the white one in you can see now I flipped it and so now it's very very rough. If I ctrl shift and click on it you can see that it's very white and if I drag this over you can see it's going to start to add more and more of that black color. So where it's white it's going to be very rough and where it's black it's going to be very shiny because if I ctr shift and click on this you can see right now it's white so now it's going to be very rough but if I drag this way down you can see now it's going to be more and more shiny and if I ctrl shift and click on this you can see those black parts are going to be more shiny. So I'm going to ctrl shift and click back on the principal and really just play around with it and get it to how I like. I want it to be pretty rough but some parts I want it to be just a little bit shiny and it just adds more detail and makes it look more interesting. So I think that looks pretty good and that's pretty good for me. Now later on in the video I am going to play around a little bit more with this shader and just make it look a little bit more interesting but for now that's going to be great. Okay so I want to put this in a frame so I'm going to select this frame press shift to duplicate and just drop it right up here and then I can just box select all these nodes and I can drag them and drop them into the frame and that's going to add it in the frame and then again if I press the n key it's going to open up this tab right here. I can just change the name I'm going to call this rust and then right down here rust as well and then I can press n to close that frame. So now we have the rust right up here and then we have the metal right down here. So now I want to mix them together so to mix these two together I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a mix shader. So mix shader I'm going to drop it right down here and then I'm going to take this bsdf plug it up there and then this one down here. So you can see that if I zoom in it's actually kind of blending them together evenly and that's really not what we want. If you drag the factor here it's going to make it all metal or all rust. What we want to do is we want to tell it that some areas are going to be rust and some areas are going to be metal. So to do this we're going to need to add another texture. So I'm going to actually drag this up so there's a little bit more room in between them and then I'll press shift a and I'm going to add another noise texture and just drop the noise texture right there. And then again I want the vector to be plugged up to the vector right here. Okay now I can control shift and click on it to preview what it's looking like. So I want the rust to be very detailed so I'm going to turn this all the way up to 16 and then the roughness I'm going to change this up to 0.9 and we will play around with this value later but for now I'm going to change it up to 0.9. So now what I can do is I can take this factor and plug it into the factor of the mix shader and then if I control shift and click on the mix shader you can see it's starting to do something because what it's doing is taking the values of this noise texture and is telling it that some of the values are going to make it the metal and the other values are going to make it the rust. But right now it's still way too subtle so what we want to do is we want to make this noise texture very contrasty. So to make it very contrasty I'm going to press shift a and search for another color ramp. Just drop the color ramp right here and then I'm going to control shift and click on it to preview what it's looking like. So I'm actually going to drag these two values out towards each other and you can see that as they get closer and closer it's going to be a lot more contrasty. So what's going to happen is wherever it's black that's going to make it the rust and then wherever it's white that's where the metal is going to be. So if you want to have more rust you can drag this kind of out this way and there's going to be more black. If you want there to be less rust you can drag it over here and make the black more subtle. So really just get it to whatever value you want you could play around with this. Now I can control shift and click on it and you can see that's what it's looking like. So now some parts are the metal and some parts are the rust. So just play around with the value and get it to the amount of rust that you like. Okay so that's looking pretty good now if I zoom way in it kind of just looks flat so what I want to do is I want to make the where the rust is actually kind of going down into the metal. So what I can do is I can actually take this color ramp and add it into the bump of the rust and then that'll make the rust looks like it's going down into the metal. So I'm going to click on this bump here press shift to duplicate it and just drop it right in here and that's going to connect it up. Then I can take this color and stick it into the height and then the strength here I need to turn this all the way up to one. Now you can see if you kind of zoom in here like right over here you can see now it looks like the rust is going down into the metal and if you control shift and click on this bump you can see that's what it's looking like. So it's adding all that detail in there and it looks pretty cool and if I control shift and click on the rust now you can see that's what the rust is looking like. So I'm going to control shift and click now on the final mix shader and just see how that's looking. So there are some things you can play around with of course you can play around with this color ramp right here and that's going to tell it how much rust and how much metal there's going to be. You can also play around with this roughness right here so if I turn it down you can see that it's going to make more bigger patchy areas of rust so if you want to have bigger areas like that you could totally do that. If you want to turn this value up you can see that it's going to make everything more subtle and the rust is more evenly placed around the metal so if you just want a tiny little bit of rust just some little grainy rust you could turn this all the way to one you can see that's what's looking like. If you want to be just patchy you could turn it down. I like somewhere around 0.9 I think that looks pretty good that way there's some rust just in little bits then there's also some patchy areas but you can really play around with this and do whatever you like. All right so I really like how that's looking so I'm going to render this out and show you the final image and there we go there is the final procedural rusty metal material.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTY5ren8WTc,Procedural Lava (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to design a procedural lava material. The tutorial covers setting up a high-quality mesh and lighting, using the Node Wrangler add-on to create two materials—a dark rock and a glowing lava emission—then blending them with a noise texture. The tutorial also includes adding displacement for texture and compositing the final image with a glow effect. The video is sponsored by Sketchfab, and the creator offers project files for purchase on Gumroad and Patreon.","In this Blender tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural lava material. Now if you'd like to purchase the project files and also help to support me, you can get that over on my Gumroad and Patreon with the links in the video description. Let's jump into Blender. Huge thank you to Sketchfab for sponsoring this video. Sketchfab is an awesome 3D model site where you can upload, buy, and sell 3D models and assets. One of my favorite features of Sketchfab is that you can upload and view your 3D models in your browser and even view them on your phone or tablet. Sketchfab also has a huge 3D model store where you can purchase 3D models and assets for your 3D work. You can also apply to become a seller on the platform. Be sure to check out Sketchfab with the links in the description. All right, just a few things that I wanted to go over before we start. I wanted to show you the setup that I have. So I've just added a camera and I just have it pointed at this icosphere. So I just added an icosphere and when I added the icosphere, right down here on the settings that would be right behind me when you add the icosphere, I just turn the subdivisions up a lot so that's very high quality. And why I did this is because later on in the tutorial, we're going to be adding a displace modifier and adding this noise texture to make it look even cooler. Now you totally don't have to do this if you don't want to, but if you'd like to, then just make sure that your mesh has some good amount of detail so that you can add this displacement modifier and it'll add all that detail there. Because if you have a mesh that doesn't have very much geometry, then the displacement modifier isn't really going to have very much to work with. Now this is a little bit high quality, so your mesh probably doesn't need to be this high quality, but just make sure that your mesh is somewhat subdivided. And then I also have these two plane lights here. So just added two plane lights and I'm in cycles render, so I just added an emission material. If you're using Eevee, then you can just add the regular lights and I just pointed them at my sphere just like this. And then one last thing that I did in the world here, I changed this to environment texture and then I added in this empty warehouse 01 1K HDR on HDRI Haven. So if you'd like to download and import the same HDRI into your Blender file, I'll have a link in the video description to the same HDRI that I'm using. And then once I added that in, I just turned the strength to 0.3. Alright, so let's get started now. So I'm just going to click on this sphere right here and make this a little bit smaller. And then I'm just going to click on new right here. So I have the shader editor right here and then I just have the 3D view in rendered mode so that we can preview the material as we create it. And then just one last really important thing before we get started, I'm going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you don't have that enabled, you can go edit and go to preferences and then click on the add-ons right here. And on the search, you can start typing in Node and then just turn on Node Wrangler. So just checkmark that. And then I'm just going to close the user preferences. And if you don't know what the Node Wrangler does, I'll show you what it does later in the tutorial. Alright, so let's start making this lava material. So I want some of the lava to be kind of a like a dark rock or dirt. And then I want the rest of the material to be that hot orange liquid lava stuff. So this principled shader, I'm going to use this for the little bits of like dirt or rock in the material. And then I need to add another material and have that be a glowing material. So that's emitting light and it looks like glowing lava. So I need to press shift A. I'm going to click on the search here and I'm going to add an emission. So an emission shader actually emits light. Now I'm going to use a feature from the Node Wrangler. If you hold down the control and shift key and then click on a node, it's going to preview what the node is doing. And you can't really see anything. It doesn't really look that different. But you can see that this has shading. And now if we click on this, this is just emitting light. So it's just white, this white color right here. So let's play around with this right now. It doesn't really look like lava at all. The color here, I'm going to turn this to a very strong red color, just slightly orange, but mostly red. And then the strength here, I'm going to turn this way up to around 37, something like that. Now you can see that it doesn't really look red anymore. And that's because we turn this up so bright. If you keep turning it up brighter and brighter, it's just going to get so bright until it's basically white. But that's actually what I want. Because later on in the video, we're going to have some parts which are going to be a little bit less bright. And so they'll look a little bit more red and a little bit more orange. And then it'll look a little bit more yellow as it kind of gets into the center of the lava, farther away from those little dark patches. And it'll look pretty cool. So even though this is super yellow right now, that's fine. And later on, it will switch to kind of an orangey, reddish, yellowy color. So that's all I'm going to do for this emission. Let's control shift and click on the principle and preview that. And let's make that kind of dark rock dirt material that's going to be in some little patchy areas. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a noise texture. I'm just going to drop the noise texture right here. And then again, using one of the features with the Node Wrangler add-on, if you have this node selected and then you press control T, that's going to add this texture coordinate and mapping. And then what I'm going to do is set this object, plug it into the vector. And that way, this noise texture is going to be placed around the object a bit more evenly. So now if I control shift and click on the noise texture, you can preview what it's looking like. So let's do some things to this. The scale here, I'm going to turn this up to somewhere around 20. And then the detail, I'm going to turn this all the way up to 16 because I want to add a lot of detail there. So I usually always turn this up to 16. And then the roughness here, I'm going to turn this to somewhere around a 0.64, just somewhere around there. And this really changes the look of it because you can see as you turn this up, it kind of gets a bit more faded and everything kind of gets more even. And as you turn it down, you can kind of see those blobs better, but at the same time, they have a lot less detail. So this roughness value does play a lot in what the noise texture actually looks like. So that's looking pretty good so far. Let's plug the factor up to the base color of the principled and then control shift and click on the principled to preview it. So the colors are really messed up. I do like the detail here, but it's just black and white. So I'm going to add another node in here to play around with the colors and make them look a bit more black and brown colored. So I'm going to press shift A and on the search here, I'm going to type in color and then I'm going to click on the color ramp node. So I'm just going to drop the color ramp node right in here in between the connection of the noise texture and the principled. So now we can play around with these colors and it'll actually change the color of this noise texture. So now I'm going to hold down the control and shift key again and click on the color ramp so that we can just preview what that color ramp looks like. So I'm going to pull this black value out and I'm going to pull up this black value to somewhere around there. I do want a good bit of black, but not too much. Somewhere around there, I think is good. And then I'm going to click on the white tab and right down here, you can change the color of the tab. So if I just click on this, you can see now we can change the color. I'm going to make this a dark brown color, not too dark, but just a little bit dark, maybe a little bit more saturated. So kind of bring it down a little bit more. And then I want to add another shade of brown. So I'm going to click on the plus right here and you can see that that adds a new tab. I'm going to slide this tab kind of right over here. You can see the position right here. So there's values for the position somewhere around 0.5, kind of in the middle, I guess. And then I'm going to make this one a little bit darker and maybe just a little bit less saturated. So now you can see what this looks like. It's a very basic kind of rock or dirt material. So now if I control shift and click back on the principle, you can see what it's looking like and that's great. Now this doesn't really look like dirt or rock or anything and that's because it doesn't have any normal or bump. So I want this to be contributing to the bump. So I'm going to take this color and plug it into the normal. And something is wrong here. That's because we need to convert this to normal data because right now it's color. You can see that little circle there is yellow and this is purple. So we need a node to convert this to data that the normal can use. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a bump node. Just drop the bump node right here. And then right now this is going into the normal. This is for if we were using a normal map. I am not using a normal map though because I'm just using this color ramp. So I'm going to plug this color into the height. Now you can see that that looks a lot cooler. And if I control shift and click on the bump, you can actually see what it's doing. So it's actually turning this color data into normal data. All right. So that looks pretty cool, but I do want to add some larger detail as well. So I'm going to actually click on this noise texture and press shift D to duplicate it and bring it down here. And then I want the object coordinates to be plugged in. So I'm just going to take the same one, the mapping right here, and plug it into the vector on this bottom noise texture as well. And then the scale here, I'm going to change this to something a lot bigger, like a 0.23, something around that. And then if I control shift and click on this, let's just see. Yeah, that's a lot bigger. Just somewhere around 0.23 is good. And then the roughness here, I'm going to change this to something around 0.4 because I don't want that much roughness. I do want it to be a lot more lumpy. You can kind of see those patches, those dark patches are a lot bigger. All right. So now I want this noise texture to go through into the principled, into the normal. So I need to actually add another bump node. So I'm going to press shift D to duplicate the bump node. I'm actually going to drop it before this one. So there we go. And then this color ramp, I want this to go into the height of the second one. Oops, didn't quite make it. There we go. And then this normal right here, I want it to go in the first one. And then this noise texture, the second one that we added, I'm going to put the factor into the height. So this second noise texture, the factor is going into the height. And then this bump here is going into the second bump. So we're mixing them together. So we plug the normal into the normal. And then to add this one to it, we're taking the color and putting that into the height. So now if I control shift and click on this, you can see that's what it's doing. So it has some really big bumps. And then with this added, there's a lot of smaller bumps. Now you can see that these smaller bumps are so strong that they're sort of taking over the bigger bumps. So I want to actually turn this strength down. So if I turn this strength way down, you can see that now there still are those bigger bumps and there's the little bumps. When you turn the little bumps way up, it almost kind of hides it. And you can't really see the bigger bumps as much. So I'm just going to drag that down and that looks a lot better. So I'm just going to make this strength somewhere around 0.3, just somewhere on there. And then if I control shift and click on this, that looks really cool. And it looks a lot more interesting. All right. So we've made our emission material and we've made our kind of rock dirt material. So now we want to mix these together. And then we want to tell Blender to have some places, have the emission, and most of the places have the emission. And then just in some little areas have that kind of rock dirt material. So to mix these together, we need to press shift A and I'm going to search for a mix shader. So just type in a mix and you can see there's a mix shader. We're just going to drop this in this connection right here. And then the emission, I'm going to plug this into the bottom one and then have the principled into the top one. Now there is this slider here. And if you change the slider, you can see that at zero, it's just the dirt material. And then if I turn it all the way up to one, it's just the emission material. So when it's in between, it's kind of mixing evenly in between them. And that doesn't really look very good. So we need to actually add some data into that factor to tell it where we want to be the emission and where we want to be the principled. So to do this, I'm going to use another noise texture. So I'm just going to select the noise texture, press shift U to duplicate it and just put it up here. And then again, I want to use the object mapping. So the vector, I'm going to plug this up to the vector right here. Now for the scale, I'm going to change this one to somewhere around seven. If I just control shift and click on that, you can kind of see the size of that. And then the roughness, I'm going to change this to somewhere around 0.62, something like that I found to be pretty good. All right. So now this noise texture here, if I just kind of bring this down, bring this over, I'm going to plug the factor up to the factor on the mix shader, and then I can control shift and click on this. So because this has some areas that are lighter and some areas that are darker, it's telling it that some areas are going to be more emission and some areas are going to be more principled. Now, right now, these colors are pretty grayed out and subtle. They're not very strong. You know, these black little bits aren't very black. So I want to make that more contrasty. So I'm going to press shift A and search for another color ramp. And I'm just going to drop the color ramp right in here between the factor and the noise texture. And then I can just control shift and click on the color ramp to see what it's doing. So I'm going to click on this black tab and just drag it out. And I'm just going to drag it to somewhere around here. You can see kind of the value or how far it is up. And you can see that now that I've dragged that out, you can see that the darker areas are really dark. And then there's those lighter areas. So now if I control shift and click on the mix shader, that looks a lot better. And you can see that there is that dirt material that we created. And then around those rocky dirt patches, it's really red and then it slowly gets more orange and then slowly gets more yellow. So I think that looks really cool. And if you want to have more lava or less lava, you can play around with this. So if you want to have just a little bit of lava and maybe have it mostly that dirt or rock, you could do that. If you want to have it kind of half and half, you kind of do that. Or if you want it to be mostly lava and only like a tiny bit of dirt or rock, you could bring it over like that. I like it to be somewhere around here. I think it looks pretty cool. Just some dark patches. And I really like the orangey red. I think that looks really cool as well. Now, if you want to have just a little bit of those dark patches, but it's too yellow because lava is pretty red, what you can do is if I just click on this emission color, you can play around with this. So if you want to be more red, you could do that. And you could also change the strength. So if you want to turn the strength down, you can see that now that value between red, orange, and yellow, you can see that a little bit better. I'm just going to pull this up though, because I want there to be more of that kind of rocky material. And the strength, I might just turn this down a little bit more so that we can see a little bit more of that kind of reddish orange. All right, just two things to finish off the tutorial. I want to add a displacement to make it kind of lumpy. You don't have to do this if you don't want to, but I'm going to do it because I think it looks pretty cool. And then at the very end, I'm just going to do a little bit of compositing and I'm going to add a glow to kind of make the lava glowing. So let's click right over here to go to the materials panel. Let me just bring this up. I'm going to click on add modifier and I'm going to click on displace. So just add the displace modifier and you can see it kind of gets really big. I'm going to click on new here and then I want to go over to the texturing panel so I can tell it what texture to use. So you can just click right over here and that'll go to the texturing tab or you can just click right down here. Now, right now it's set to image or movie. I want to use a procedural texture. So I'm going to click right here and I'm going to change this to clouds. Now, let me just go out of rendered mode so that we can kind of see what this is looking like. Now with these settings right here, I found that Verona F1 does look pretty cool. And then also I found that it looks a little bit better if this is set to color. And then the size, I'm going to change this to somewhere around 0.45. I think that looks pretty cool as well. Now let's click back over here to the modifiers and we can change the strength value. So if you just click and drag, you can change the strength and I just want to kind of flip it. So right now it's kind of like this. So those kind of lumps are going in. If I flip that, now we have some lumps coming out. And then if you want to make your movements more sensitive while you're dragging this, you can hold down the shift key and that'll make those movements a little bit more sensitive. Okay, let's go into rendered view, kind of see how that's looking. Maybe make that a little bit less strong, just kind of looking at the sides there, make it the strength that you want. Okay, maybe just a tiny bit stronger. Okay, I think that looks pretty cool. And then because we're going to be having a glow in the compositor, I'm just going to press S and scale this whole thing down a little bit, just so that there's a little bit more space around that. Okay, let's just look at that in full screen. That's looking pretty cool. All right, so I'm just going to press F12 to render this. And then after it's done rendering, we're going to do just a little bit of compositing. All right, it's finished now. So let's just do a little bit of compositing. So I'm going to scroll right over here and then I'm going to click on the compositing tab. Click on use nodes and then also make sure the backdrop is turned on. And then there should be a render layers and composite. If there aren't these nodes, you can press shift A and search for both of them. And then I'm just going to plug the image up to the composite. Now, if we control shift and click on it, it's going to add a viewer and that's using the node wrangler feature again. And we can preview it in the background. I'm also just going to close the timeline because I don't need the timeline. So I'm going to move my mouse right here, click, drag up, drag down, and then let go. And that'll close the timeline. And then also this panel right here, I'm going to press N to close that. And then I've rendered this out with a transparent background. So right down here in the render settings, you can turn on transparent. And then that way the background will be rendered transparent. So if you've done that, then that's great. If you haven't done that, that's totally fine. You can do whatever you want to do. Because I've rendered that with a transparent background, I'm going to press shift A and search for an alpha over node. And I'm just going to drop the alpha and over node right here in the composite. And then just control shift and click on the alpha over node. Now I need to take this image and plug it into the bottom one. And that way we have the lava. And then this image is in the background. Now this, I want to turn this way down to almost fully black because I want the lava to really stand out. And I might just make this a slightly blue material or a slightly blue color and then make that really dark. All right. Now I also want to add the denoise node just to smooth that out a little bit. So I'm going to press shift A, search for the denoise. And then I'm just going to drop the denoise right here in the composite. And then again, just control shift and click on the denoise to put the viewer node right into there. And that just denoises the image and smooths it out a little bit. Now I should have said this earlier, but if you want to make this backdrop bigger or smaller, you can press V to zoom out and Alt V to zoom in. And then also if you want to move the background, you can hold down the Alt key and click with your middle mouse button. And that's going to move the backdrop. All right. So let's just add in that glow to make it look really cool. So I'm going to press shift A here, search for a glare. I'm going to drop the glare right back here. And then right now it's set to streaks. I'm actually going to change this to a fog glow and then wait for it to composite. There we go. Now I'm going to change this to low. And if I change it to low, there's actually going to be more glow. If you change it to high, there's going to be a very small amount of glow. So it really depends on what you want to do. I'm just going to change this to low because I want there to be a bit more glow. And there we go. That looks really cool. So to save this image, I'm going to press F11 and that'll go to the render result. And then click on this. I'm going to click on a viewer node so we can see our final compositing. And then to save the image, just click on image. And then you can just click on save as or press Ctrl-Alt-S. And then it'll bring up a file browser and you can just save this to your computer. So there we go. That is the procedural lava material. Thank you for watching. I hope this video was helpful.

Be sure to check out Sketchfab with the links in the description. So in this tutorial, we're going to be creating three different procedural marble materials. So the first one here that we're going to be creating is this white one here. And this is a pretty basic standard one. And I have these cubes here with a bevel added. And that way you can see what the material would look like if it were used for something like a kitchen scene or something like that or like a tabletop or a flooring or something like that. Because for most things that you're going to be using this for, you probably wouldn't actually use it for just a sphere. But I like a sphere as well to preview the material. So we're going to be creating this white one here first. And this is a pretty standard typical marble material. Then we're going to be creating this other one here. And this is kind of a dark one with some little light bits. And you can see if you zoom way in, there's a lot of little detail in there. And here's what it looks like if it were going to be used for like a tabletop in a kitchen scene or something like that. And then right over here, we're going to be creating this third one as well. And this one has a lot more detail. If I zoom in here, you can see it has all that little noise there. And so those little white areas. And it also has a little bit of detail right in there in the black. And then again, here's what it looks like if it were on like a tabletop or something in some kind of architecture scene or something like that. All right. And before we start, I did just want to show you the setup that I have. So I have these three cubes here and I just kind of scaled them down and I added a bevel modifier on them so that it has a smooth edge. And then I just have these icospheres here, which when I added the icosphere down here on the settings right behind me, when you add an icosphere, there'll be those little settings. And I just turned these subdivisions up to a pretty high amount so that they were very smooth. And then I just added a camera and I put the camera right there so that you can see the objects. And then as far as the lighting goes, I added this AutoShop 01 1K HDR on HDRI Haven. There will be a link in the video description if you'd like to download the same HDRI that I'm using. So I just downloaded the 1K version. So I just added this HDRI as an environment texture into the world. And then I just left the strength at one. And I think it gives some really nice lighting for these marble materials. And then before we start, make sure you have the Node Wrangler add-on enabled because that's a really great add-on for working with nodes. If you don't have that enabled, you can go Edit and go to Preferences and then click on the add-ons right here. And then right here on the search, you can start typing in Node and then just checkbox the Node Wrangler and then close this. And I'll also have timestamps in the video description if you just like to make one of the materials. Let's get started. So I'm just going to select this and I'm going to click on New and I'm going to call this Marble Light. OK, because we're going to be making the light one first. And then what I'm going to do is right here, I'm going to click on this and drag it and drop it down here. And that way, when I go into rendered mode, we can preview the material and these are both going to have the same material. You can see if I change the color, they're both going to have that material. So as we build the material, we can preview what it's looking like. All right, so this first light marble material is actually going to be pretty easy to make. We're going to press Shift-A and I'm going to search for a noise texture. Just click on the noise texture and drop it right here. So using one of the features of the Node Wrangler, I'm going to click on this noise texture and make sure it's selected. And then I'm going to press Control-T. So what Control-T does is it's going to add this mapping and texture coordinate. And what I'm going to do is plug this object up to the vector. And that way, this noise texture is going to be placed around the object more evenly. Now, using another feature from the Node Wrangler, if we hold down the Control and Shift key while we click on nodes, it's going to add this viewer node and we can preview just what that node is seeing. So I can just hold down the Control and Shift key and click on these different nodes to preview what it's seeing. But I'm just going to click on the noise texture because that's what I want to see. All right, so I'm going to leave everything to the default except the detail. The detail I'm going to turn to the max, which is 16. And you can see if I zoom in here, it's kind of subtle. You can't really see it because of how gray and light it is. But there is now a lot more detail in that texture. Now, if I plug this noise texture factor up to the base color and then hold down the Control and Shift keys and click on the principled, you can see what it's looking like. Doesn't really look like marble yet. What I want to do is I actually want to distort this so that it acts a little bit more like marble. So what I can do is I can click on this noise texture, press Shift D to duplicate it and drop it right behind here in between the mapping and texture coordinate. And as you can see, it's warping that texture. So now instead of just looking like a noise texture, it looks a lot different. If I Control Shift and click on this, you can see now that's what it's doing. And already I think this texture looks a lot more like marble. So now I'm just going to Control Shift click on the principled and you can see this is what it's looking like. Now, right now it is still pretty light and gray. So I want to change those colors a bit. So I'll press Shift A, search for a color ramp and then just drop this color ramp right in here. And then I actually want to switch these. So I'm going to put the white over here, this white tab. So just click on the white tab and put it somewhere around here. And then the black one, I'm going to kind of move it till it's more over here. And you can see now that marble material is a lot darker. Now this black here, I actually want to make it a very, very slight blue. You can make it any color that you want. Like if you want to have green marble or brown marble or something like that. I just want to have a very, very slight blue. So I'm going to change it to kind of a bluish grayish color and then make it very dark. So it still looks pretty black, but it just has a very, very slight blue color right in there. All right. So that is looking a lot better, but I think that the texture is a little bit too detailed right now. So what I can do is over on this noise texture, the one that's going through the texture coordinate, the scale here, I'm going to turn this to like two and that way now the texture is a lot bigger. All right. So it's looking a lot like marble, but it needs to be a lot more shiny because marble is very shiny. So you can see over here on the principle, this roughness value, I'm just going to turn this way down and it'll be a lot more reflective. And I'll turn it down to something around a 0.1, something like that. Maybe just a little bit more like a 0.15. Let me just try that. 0.15. Yeah, that looks pretty good. And you can see that now it's reflecting those different lights there from the HDRI. All right. Now, before we finish this material, I just want to add a little bit of bump. So let me just drag these over. So we have a little bit more room. I want to take this color and plug it into the normal so that we have just a tiny little bit of bump. Now, when we plug that in, something is wrong here and you can see there's like those shading issues. That's because this is a yellow one and this is a purple one. So this is color data and this is normal data because it's purple. So we need to actually add a node to convert that. So to convert it, we'll press shift A. I'm going to search for a bump node and then just drop the bump node right in here. And then this actually needs to go up to the height. So the color to the height and then the bump to the normal. Now, if you look at it, you can see that it looks really rough now and really bumpy and marble is pretty smooth, but I think it does look a little bit nicer. It just has a very, very subtle roughness, but that's way too big. So we need to turn this strength way down. So I'm actually going to turn the strength to 0.02. And that way it's just very, very subtle. You almost can't see it because marble is very, very shiny and smooth. But if you zoom in here really close, you can see there's just a tiny bit of roughness. You may even want to turn this down to a 0.01 if you want to. But I think that looks pretty good. It just adds a little bit more detail to this material. And that's the material. So it's actually pretty simple and easy to make. And I think the result looks pretty good. All right. So let's move right over here to the middle one. I'm just going to select this and we're going to add a new material. And I'm going to call this material marble dark. So we're going to start off kind of making it similar to the other one, but then we're going to change it a bit to make it look dark and make it look better for the dark material. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for another noise texture. Just drop it right here. And then the detail size, I'm going to turn that all the way up to 16 and then leave everything else how it is. So I also want this material to be on this bottom one right here. So what I can do is just drop color it. So I can just drag this, drop it over and then drop it on there. And now we can preview the material on the sphere as well as the cube. All right. Now, remember with the Node Wrangler add-on, if you select a noise texture or any other texture and you press control T, it's going to add this texture cord and mapping. And then the object, I just want to plug this up to the mapping. And that way the noise texture is going to be placed around the objects a little bit better. And then once again, I'm going to do the same thing. So I'm going to select this noise texture, press shift D to duplicate it and drop it over on this one. And then the scale here, I'm going to change this to two. So now if we plug this factor here into the base color, you can start to see what it's looking like. And so far it looks pretty similar to this material. What I want to do though, for this material is add some very, very fine small detail. So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to press B and box select all of these nodes and just kind of move them up. And then I'm going to press shift D to duplicate them and bring them down. And then I'm going to hold down the control and shift key using the feature from the node wrangler and just click on this. And now we can preview it. And then what I'm going to do for this bottom one is the scale here. I'm going to change this to 200. So now it's way more detailed than if you zoom in here, you can see it's really detailed, but because this noise texture right here is plugged through the texture coordinate and mapping, it's warping it and making it look a bit more like marble. So I can control shift and click on this one. You can see here is the larger detail. And then if I control shift and click on this one, here is the more fine detail. So what I want to do is I want to add these together, but before I mix them together, I do want to play around with the colors because right now they're both just a light color and I want to make them dark. So I'm actually going to box select these and just move them over. So we have a little bit more room and then I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Just drop the color ramp node right there. And then this factor here, I'll plug this up to the factor on the color ramp. And then I also want that same color ramp to be on this one. So if I control shift and click on the principled BSDF, then I can select this color ramp, press shift to duplicate it and just drop it right here. And then it will plug it up into the principled. So let's first work with the top color ramp. So I'm going to first select this black one and I'm going to plug this black tab over to somewhere right here. Then this white tab, I'm going to select it and kind of move it over here and just kind of put it somewhere about here. You can see that when I add more or less, it's going to get stronger or less strong. Like if I move it really close here, you can see that white is really strong. But if I move it way down, you can see it's starting to fade out a little bit. So I like it somewhere around here. And then I want there to be a little bit more gray. So I'm going to click on the plus to add a new tab. And this tab, I want to be pretty close to the black one somewhere around here. And then I'm going to make it, if I just zoom out, I'm going to click on this color right here and I'm going to change the color of the tab and just make it a bit more gray colored. So now if I control shift and click on this, you can kind of see what it's doing. So this black one here, it's making everything black and you can kind of push this in to the amount that you want. And then this gray one here, it's adding more gray, but then this white one here, just those light parts, the really light parts of the texture, it's making that even brighter. And then the gray is kind of going around the white. And then one more thing that I'm going to do, this black one here, I'm going to click on it, go to the color and then move my mouse up here and just scroll wheel one up. And that way it'll just bump it up a little bit. You could even go two. I'm just going to go one. And that way it's not fully black. It's just very, very slightly gray, but it's mostly black. All right. So let's go do this bottom color ramp now. So I will control shift and click on the bottom color ramp right here. And for this one, I'm going to switch these. So I'm going to put the white over here and the black over here. Just put the black one somewhere around here. You can see if I bring it bigger, there's going to be more black. And if I bring it farther this way, there's going to be less black. So I'm just going to bring it somewhere around here. And then this white one here, I'll just bring it kind of over here. And I'm going to change this to a gray color. So click on the color right here and just make it gray, kind of a light gray, something like that. And then I want to add one more. So I'll click on the plus here to add another one. If I just zoom in here, you can see what it's doing. So it has the black and then it's going to gray and then to lighter. This one, I'm going to bring this one a little bit more towards the black and make it a little bit darker. So just click on this. If you're zoomed way in and you click on this, you're not going to be able to see it because it's too big. So if you just zoom out, then you can just make this a little bit darker. All right. So just a little bit darker. There we go. You can see this is what it's looking like. All right. So now we have this texture and this texture. So I want to now mix these two together. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for the mix RGB because we want to mix the colors together. So I'm going to click on this and then just drop it right here. And then I'm going to take this color and put it into color two. And then this one here is in color one. Now, if I control shift and click on it, you can see what it's doing. So I'm just going to leave this set to mix because I think that looks pretty good. So what it's doing is taking this very small texture and mixing it with the bigger texture. And if you want to, you can also play around with the factor. So if you turn the factor all the way over here, it's just going to be the bigger texture. And if you turn the factor all the way up to one, it's going to be the small texture. I like to leave it somewhere in the middle, but you can play around with it. So now I can control shift and click on this and you can see there's the texture. Now you can see that it's not very shiny. So just like the other material, the roughness, I'm going to turn this way down to something like a 0.15. So that's very shiny. And because we added that HDR for the lighting, it's adding some very realistic lighting and it's adding in all those little reflections and stuff. And that really helps to make it feel more photorealistic. So we're almost done with this material. The last thing that I want to do is just add another bump and just make it very, very subtle. I just think that it helps a little bit. So this color here, I'm going to drop this color into the normal. And then once again, just like with the first material, we need to convert it to normal data. So I'm going to press shift A, search for a bump node, drop the bump node right in here. And then this color needs to go into the height and then the purple needs to go into the purple. And now that is converting it to normal data. Now the strength is way too large right now. If you kind of zoom in here, you can see that really doesn't look good. It's just really a bumpy. So we need to turn this strength way down. And for this one, I'm going to turn it to like a 0.01. And that makes it very, very subtle. And you may not really notice anything because it's so subtle, but if you zoom way in, you can see there's just a tiny little bit of detail here. Sort of like if you were in a kitchen and there's like a marble surface and you were to just rub your hand over it, you might just feel some very, very subtle noise. It's very subtle because marble is pretty shiny, but I do think that it helps to make it look a little bit better. So there we go. There is the second marble material. So I'm just going to head over here to the third one. Just click on this and then I'll click on new. And this one I'm going to type in marble swirl because it kind of has some swirls. So marble swirl. And then I'm also going to click on this and drag the material over to here. So these both have the same material. Now let's do this last marble material. So I'm going to press shift A. And this time I'm going to click on the search. And instead of adding a noise texture like the other ones, I'm going to add a Voronoi texture. And I'm going to start with that. So I'll add that in right there. And then just like we did for the other ones, I'm going to click on this and using the feature from the Node Wrangler, I'm going to press control T with that selected and that'll add those. And then I'll just put the object up to the vector. Now, if I control shift and click on it, you can see what it's doing. And then instead of this being F1, I'm going to change this to distance to edge. And you can see that now it adds all these cracks right here. And then the scale here, I think I want to turn this up to about eight. And that way everything is scaled down just a little bit. Now, right now, this doesn't really look like marble. So what I'm going to do is use a similar technique to what we did for the other ones. So I'm going to press shift A, search for a noise texture. And this time I'm going to drop the noise texture right here before the Voronoi going through the vector. And you can see that now it adds noise to that mapping. And you can see that now our Voronoi texture has a bunch of noise and it looks a lot more interesting. Now, right now, the scale is a little bit too big. So I'm going to change this to somewhere around a 1.6. I think that looks a little bit better. And then the detail right here, I'm going to turn this all the way up to 16. And you can see that now we have tons of detail in that texture. Now, to add even more detail, what you can do is you can actually turn up the roughness here on the noise texture. So if I just turn this up, maybe to somewhere around a 0.7, you can see that now it adds even more detail. All right, so now let's plug this distance here into the base color and Ctrl Shift click on the principled. And you can see what it's looking like. So I want to make it a lot darker because this marble material is dark. So once again, I'll press Shift A and search for a color ramp. Drop the color ramp right in here. And then this black one, I'm going to just pull it out a little bit. I think I'll actually Ctrl Shift and click on this while we're editing it so we can see it a little bit better. So I'll just pull the black out a little bit. And then this white one, I'll pull to about here. And then I'll make it a little bit more gray, just because if it's fully white, that's a little bit too bright. So I'm just going to make it a little bit more gray. And then I want to add one more because I want to kind of have a gray in between the black and the white. So I'll click on the plus right here and I'll just leave that about where it is. And I'm going to make this even more gray, a little bit darker, something like that. So you can see that now most of it's black, some of it's gray, and then just a few little parts are white. Maybe I just pull this over. It's not actually white, it's a very light gray. But if I pull this over, you can start to see that there's even more white just in the lightest areas. All right, that looks very good. So I'm going to Ctrl Shift and click back on the principle and we can see what this is looking like. So that's very good for our base, but we don't have all those little cracks and swirls. So now I'm going to add all those white little streaks and white cracks. So what I'm going to do is press B for the box select, select these notes and just move them up so that we can make our next texture right down here. So I'm going to press Shift A and search for a wave texture. Just drop the wave texture underneath the noise and then we can actually use the same texture coordinate and mapping. So I'm just going to plug the vector right up to this vector because they're really just the same thing. So we can just use the same nodes for this one as well. I'm going to Ctrl Shift and click on the wave texture so we can preview what it looks like. Now the scale here, I think I'm going to turn this to somewhere around three. I'm going to turn up the distortion to somewhere around 22. I think that looks pretty good. And then the detail, I'm going to turn this all the way up to 16 because I like to add as much detail as I can. All right, and that looks pretty good. So now let's play around with the colors. So I'll press Shift A, search for a color ramp node and just drop the color ramp node right here. And then what I want to do is these lines here or these swirls or cracks, I want to make those light and then I want to make everything else dark. So I can click on this and pull it way down and you can see that now it just shows those little white areas. And then this is really contrasty. So I want to add something in the middle so that it kind of has a fading point. So it goes from black to gray to white. So I'll click on this plus here to add a new one. So this one is going to actually be overlapping this one here, this tab, but I'm just going to turn it really, really close. Just zoom way in and make it really close. And then this gray here, I'm going to turn it down and you can see that when I turn it down, now it has black and then gray and then white right there. And if I zoom out, you can see those white parts are actually a little bit too thick. So I'm going to zoom way in here and pull this gray one super, super close. And that way that white little part right there is going to be even thinner. And then to make it even thinner, the gray tab, you can make this a little bit darker and that way they're going to be even smaller and there's going to be more black. I just want them to be pretty thin. I don't want them to be very big. So just like that. All right. So this is cool, but you can see that all of these are kind of rotating like this because before we added all that distortion, the wave texture was kind of starting up here and it was going in circles around right here. And so what I want to do is add some more of these and mix them together so that there are some different lines going different directions. Because like you can see this one, all the lines are kind of going back and forth. And this one, all the lines are kind of circulating around the circle. So to do this, I'm going to zoom out and I'm going to box select the texture coordinate and mapping, as well as the wave texture and color ramp. I'm going to press shifty to duplicate them and just move them down here. And maybe I'll just reorganize this a little bit. Okay. That looks a little bit nicer. So how I rotate these streaks here is I'm going to zoom into this mapping and the rotation Z, I'm going to start to turn this up and you can see it doesn't look like anything's happening. That's because I need to control shift and click on this. And now if I start to turn this up, you can see that it's rotating around. So I'm just going to turn it up to something that I like. And then you could also change the X and the Y. So just kind of rotate it around. So you can just play around with these values and change it to the rotation that you like. But I'm just going to actually turn the X and Y both to zero and then turn the Z value to somewhere around 238. And that way you can see that now they're kind of rotating over like this. So now we have this one and we have this one. So what I want to do is actually mix these two together. So to do that, I'm going to press shift A and search for the mix RGB. Just drop it right here. And then this color, I'm going to plug this one up to color one. And then this one, I'm going to plug up to color two. And then if I control shift and click on the mix, you can see it's adding them together. And what I'm going to do is turn this mix to add. And that way you can see it's a little bit brighter because when it's set to mix, it's just kind of blending these together. So one of them has to be a little bit faded. So I'm going to change this to add. And now you can see it's just adding both of them together on top of each other. So now you can see we have this swirly texture right here. And then if I control shift and click on this, we have this base texture right here. So I want to mix them together. So I'm going to use this same node right here and just mix it the way that I've mixed these. So I'll press shift D to duplicate this add, drop it right here. And then this color is going to go to color one. And this one is going to go to color two. And then if I control shift and click on this add, you can see what it's doing. Now, what I want to actually do is take this factor here and turn it down a little bit because I want these swirly bits to be even more subtle because you can see right here, they're actually pretty bright. So I'm just going to turn this down a bit just because I really don't want them to be super bright because if they're too bright, they're just going to look way too strong and they're going to just stand out way too much. So I'm just going to turn it down and just make it more subtle. So it's still there. You can still see it. But if I change this to somewhere around a 0.25, you can see that now it's a lot more subtle and that actually looks really cool. That is a really cool texture. All right. So let's control shift and click on the principle and you can see there it is. So once again, this roughness here, I'm going to turn this way down. So I'm just going to turn this down to like a 0.1, something like that. You could turn it down even more if you wanted, but I feel like that's a little bit too shiny. But if you turn it up too much, you can see that definitely looks too rough. So somewhere around 0.1 or 0.2, something like that looks pretty nice. For this one, I think I'm actually going to turn this to somewhere around a 0.2. I think I just like that a little bit better. And then one last thing before we finish this, just like the other materials, I want to add a very, very slight bump. So I will click on this color, drop it into the normal. Now we need to convert this because this is yellow, which is dealing with color, and this is purple, which is dealing with normal. So I'm going to press Shift-A, search for a bump node, drop the bump node right in here. And then the height, I need to take the color, put that up to the height instead of the normal. And then this normal is going to go down into this normal. Now the strength here is way too strong. Again, you can see that's like really bumpy. So I'm going to turn the strength way down to something around a 0.01. So it's very, very subtle because marble is pretty shiny and smooth. But you can see if I zoom way in here, there's just some very, very slight bump. Like right there, you can kind of see it. This is a little bit smoother, and then that's a little bit more rough. So there we go. There is the finished swirly marble material. So there we go. There is the three marble materials. So you now have three really nice marble materials that you can use for your projects. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope it was helpful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEXHCsrTsco,Procedural Dirt Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video is a Blender tutorial on creating a procedural dirt material. The instructor guides viewers through the process of setting up the material using nodes, starting with a noise texture to create a base and adding a color ramp to adjust colors. The tutorial covers techniques for adding bump and detail through various textures, such as Musgrave and Voronoi, and demonstrates how to adjust roughness for realism. The tutorial also includes tips for using the material in both Cycles and Eevee render engines, with specific adjustments for each. The instructor offers project files for purchase on Gumroad and provides them to Patreon supporters.","In this Blender tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this procedural dirt material. Now if you'd like to purchase the project files and also help to support me, you can do that over on my Gumroad store, links will be in the description. And also my patrons on Patreon will be getting the project files as well. So here is the procedural material that we're going to be creating. Now it may look a little bit complicated when you can see it all right here, but I will walk you through the entire process. And once you understand how it works and what all the pieces do, it's actually not that complicated. So you can put this material on really any object that you want, like maybe you're making a nature scene or something and you want to put it on the ground, you can totally do that. But for this tutorial, I'm just going to be using this sphere here. So I just added a sphere, and then I added a camera, and I just pointed the camera right at the sphere. And then I also have two plane lights, so I just added some lights and turned the emission on so that the lights are shining on the object. And then I'm also going to be using an HDRI from HDRI Haven. So I'm going to be using this Wooden Lounge 1K HDR. Link will be in the description if you'd like to download the same one that I'm using. So I just added this HDR into the world, and that way we just get a little more realistic lighting. So you can do that if you'd like to. Now I am going to be using the Cycles render engine to create this because the Cycles render engine just looks a little bit better. But I will show you at the very end how I would just change the material a little bit to make it look a little bit better if you want to use Blender Eevee instead. All right, so I just have the sphere over here on the left side so that you can see the material as we create it, and I have it up in rendered mode. And then I also made this panel really small because we're not really going to be using this for most of the tutorial. So I just made it really small so that we have a really big workspace to do our node setup. And then one last thing before we start the tutorial, I'm going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on. If you don't have that enabled, you can go to Edit and go to Preferences, and then go right over here to the Add-ons. And then right here on the search, you can start typing in Node Wrangler. So this is an add-on that's built into Blender. You can just click on that to select it and turn it on, and then I'll just close this. Okay, so let's click on New here, and then I can just make a name. Maybe I'm going to call it Dirt. Now what I'm going to do is press Shift-A, and I'm going to click on the search here, and I'm going to start typing in Noise. So we're going to add the noise texture. So just click on the noise texture and drop it right here. Now I'm going to be using a feature from the Node Wrangler. So what you do is you click on the noise texture, make sure it's selected, and then you're going to press Ctrl-T. And Ctrl-T is going to add this texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now what I want to do is I want to take this object, click on it, and then drop it into the vector of the mapping. And that way, the noise texture is going to be placed around your object a little bit better. So now I'm going to hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on the noise texture. And that's using another feature from the Node Wrangler add-on. And what it does is it adds this viewer node, and it plugs it up to whatever texture we're looking at. And that way, we can preview the different textures. So we can just hold down the Ctrl and Shift key and click on different nodes, and it's going to preview what that node is by itself. So now I'm going to play around with some of these values on the noise texture. So the scale, you can change it to whatever you like. I find that something around eight works good for this sphere. And then the detail here, I'm going to turn this up to 16. So if I turn up this detail, if I zoom in here, you can see it just adds a little bit of detail. It's kind of hard to see because this is kind of black and white, but it will be easier to see later on in the tutorial. And it just makes a lot more detail in the texture. So now this factor here, I'm going to plug it up to the base color. Now, if I Ctrl Shift and click on the principle, you can see that it's just kind of white and gray because we haven't really given it the colors that we want for the dirt. So to actually make the different kind of dirt colors that we want, I'm going to press Shift A and I'm going to click on the search here and start typing in color ramp. I'm just going to add this color ramp node, and I'm going to drop the color ramp node in between the noise texture and the principle. So if I just drop this in here, and if now if I Ctrl Shift and click on the color ramp, you can see what it's doing. So basically what we can do is we can pull around these sliders here and you can see if I pull this in more, it's going to make everything more dark. And if I pull this one out, it's going to make everything more light. And then when you click on these little sliders right here, you can see that there is a color below it. So we can actually change this color and make all the different colors that we want for our dirt. So what I'm first going to do is just drag this black value way out because I want the dirt to be a lot darker. So I'm just going to drag it out to somewhere around here. And then I'm going to click on the white slider. And this one, I'm going to make a very dark brown. And that'll be a good base color for our dirt. And then I want to add one more color. So I'm going to click on the plus here, and that's going to add a new slider. I can just click on this and slide it kind of in between these two. And this one, I'm going to make a slightly lighter, slightly more yellow brown. I just find that that looks a little bit nice. And then if I Ctrl Shift and click on the principle, you can see that's what it looks like. So it's kind of black with a couple shades of brown. So this isn't really looking like dirt. And that's because we need to add more bump to the dirt because dirt is very bumpy. You know, there's lots of little rocks and little pieces of the dirt, which makes it really bumpy. So what I want to do is plug the factor of this noise texture up to the normal here. And that's going to give it a lot of bump. Now you can see when it does this, something looks really weird here. There's kind of some shading issues. And that's because this right here, we need to convert this data to data that the normal map can understand. So what I'm going to do is press Shift A here, click on the search, and I'm going to start typing in bump. So you can see there is the bump node. And I can actually click and drop the bump node right in between here. So this bump node is basically a converter. So it takes whatever you feed in and it turns it into normal data that the principled shader can use. So the factor here, we actually need to plug this into the height. You can see that this is gray right here. And then it plugs into the height here, which is also gray. And then the bump node converts it to normal data. So now this little circle here is purple. And then we can plug the purple into the purple right there. So whenever there is a purple dot right here, that's using normal data. So you can see that now it's working properly. And there is a bunch of bump and a lot more detail in our material. Now, right now it's pretty strong. So on the strength here, I'm just going to click on this and change this to something like a 0.2. And that way it's a lot less strong now. All right, so now I want to play around with the roughness right here. So you can see that there is this roughness value. And if you turn it up, it's going to make everything a lot more rough. And if you turn it down, it's going to make everything look a lot more shiny. What I want to do is make some areas of the dirt kind of be more dry. And so it'll be less shiny. And then I want some of the parts of the dirt to be a little bit more wet and moist. So maybe it'll look a bit muddy. And if it's muddy and wet, it's going to need to be a bit more shiny. So I'm going to tell it where it's going to be more rough and where it's going to be more shiny. So I'm going to start off by plugging the factor here into the roughness right here. And you can see that now some parts are a little bit more rough and some parts are a little bit more shiny, but I want to be able to control it even more. So I'm actually going to box select these nodes and pull them out and then just pull this up a little bit and pull this down a little bit just so that we have a little bit more room in here. Now I'm going to press Shift A, click on the search, and I'm going to add another color ramp. So just click on the color ramp and drop it right down here. So now if I play around with these values, you can see it's going to change how shiny it is and how rough it is. So you can see if I drag this down here, now you can see that a lot of these parts are a lot more rough and then some parts are a bit more shiny. So what I want to do is just drag this out a little bit. If I drag it way too down, that's like super, super rough. It just looks very, very chalky and that's not really realistic. So I'm going to bring this back a little bit, just make things a little bit more rough. And then this black value right here, if I just pull this out a little bit, you can see it's going to make things a little bit more shiny. So you can see that parts right here kind of look more like dry soil and then parts right here look kind of more wet and muddy and moist. All right, so let's go ahead and add more bump because right now if I control shift and click on this bump, this is pretty cool, but it is a little bit simple and so I want to add a lot more bump to make it look a lot more like dirt and more interesting. So I'm going to again box select these by pressing B and then clicking and dragging and selecting these and just dragging them out. Now what I'm going to do is press shift A, click on the search and I'm going to add a musgrave texture. So just click on this and drop it right down here and then just plug this vector up to the vector right here. And I think I'll just pull these down a little bit. What we're going to be doing is all of the textures that we add, we're going to plug this vector up to the vector here because this object coordinates work a little bit better for these kind of textures. So on the musgrave texture, the scale here, I'm going to change this up to about a 15 and if I control shift and click on it, you can see what it's doing. So you can just play around with this slider and get it to how you like. So now what I want to do is I want to add this musgrave texture into the bump. So what I need to do is actually duplicate this bump node. So I'll click on it and press shift D to duplicate it and drop it right down here and I can kind of bring this up and then what I want to do is plug this height here into the height right here. So this is how you add multiple layers of bump together. You can see this noise texture is plugged into the height but you can see that not only is there a height but there's also a normal. So when you're adding them together, the normal plugs into the normal and then to add more layers of bump onto the normal, you plug the next one into the height right here. So you can see that now if I control shift and click on this, it's adding this on top of the other one. So if I control shift and click on this, you can see this is just with the noise texture and then if I control shift and click on the bump, it's now added the musgrave texture over the top of the noise texture and then I can just play around with the strength value here. If I want to turn it up, that's a little bit too high. So just play around with it and make it the strength that you want. Something around there and then if I control shift and click on the principled, you can see that now it's a lot more interesting and I think I'll change this strength here to something around a 0.1, something like that because I don't want it to be too strong. There we go. That looks better. Now this is just my preference but it looks like some of these areas are a little bit too dark. You can see there's some pretty dark patches right there. So to change this, I can just click on the color ramp here and just pull this down a little bit and that way it's going to get rid of those dark areas and make it a little bit more subtle. Alright, so this is starting to look pretty cool but I want to add some little cracks and crevices into the texture because sometimes dirt has little bits of cracks and little crevices and things and it will make it look a lot more interesting. So what I'm going to do is press shift A and click on the search and this time I'm going to add the Verona texture. Just drop it right down here and then once again, I'm going to plug this up to the vector here. Now if I control shift and click on the Verona texture, you can see what it's doing. So the scale here, I'm going to turn this up to something around a 10 and then you can see that it just adds a bunch of little dots. What I want to do is make some little cracks and crevices in the texture. Click on this F1 here and you can change this to distance to edge and you can see now it's adding all these little cracks and chunky pieces. Now you can see that these edges here are pretty straight and I want to make them kind of cracked and a bit more random. So what I can do is pull this over a little bit and then I can actually duplicate this noise texture and put it in here to make the cracks a little bit more noisy. So if I click on this noise texture, press shift D to duplicate and drop it right down here. You can see that this is what it's doing. So it's feeding it through the vector and then that color is just going into the vector there and you can see that now it adds a lot more noise to those cracks. And then the scale here is way too high, so the scale right here, I'm going to turn this down to like a one and that way our cracks are a lot bigger. And then if you want to play around with the detail size, you can. So if you add less detail, it's not really going to be any detail. I'm just going to leave this up to 16 because I like to have a lot of detail in the cracks. So now what I can do is I can plug this into the bump as well. So I'm going to click on the bump, press shift D to duplicate it again, drop it right in here and you can see that to add more layers of bump on top of each other, the normal needs to go into the normal and then we can add another layer of bump on top of that by plugging the distance here into the height. Now if I control shift and click on this, you can see it's not really doing much. That's because we need to turn the strength up. So I'm going to turn the strength all the way up to one and you can see that now it adds lots of like deep creases in there. So if I control shift and click on the principle, you can see this is what it's doing. Now to see it with and without, what you can do is actually select the bump and press M and M is the shortcut for muting the node. So I can press M, that's going to mute it and then you can see what it's looking like and then if I press M again, that's going to unmute the texture and so you can see this is what it's doing. So with what it's doing right now, it almost messes up the dirt texture because it's just way too strong. At least I don't really like it. You can leave it like that if you want to, but I want to make those cracks a lot smaller because right now they're just really big. So to make these cracks smaller, I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp. Just click on another color ramp and drop it in. And then this color ramp, I'm just going to drop it right in here in front of the Verona texture. So if I control shift and click on this now, you can see that it's just black and white and so to make these cracks smaller, we can pull this white value closer to the black value. So you can see now the cracks are getting thinner and thinner and thinner and now this is just being feeded right in here into the height. So if I control shift and click on this, you can see now there still are those cracks, but it's a lot thinner. So you can just play around with this if you want the cracks to be a lot bigger and pull this out. But if you want the cracks to be a lot smaller, you can squish this together more and more until the cracks are just really thin. And I like the cracks being really thin, just really small right there, but you can still see them. So now if I control shift and click on the principle, you can see that is looking really cool. But what I don't like about this is that there are cracks everywhere and I want there to be just some cracks here and there, but not cracks over the majority of the material. So what I can do is I can actually tell it to have a few different patchy areas where there are cracks, and then most of the texture is going to have no cracks. So to do this, I'm actually going to click on this noise texture and press shift D to duplicate it and drop it right down here. And then once again, the vector, I'm going to plug up to the vector right here. And then the scale here, I'm going to change this down to like a five because that'll make it a lot smaller. If I control shift and click on it, you can see what it's doing. So what I'm going to do is use this noise texture to tell it where the cracks are going to be and where the cracks are not going to be. So we actually need to mix this noise texture in with the Voronoi texture. So to do this, I'm going to press shift A, click on the search, and I'm going to type in mix and I'm going to add the mix RGB. RGB stands for red, green, blue. So this is basically mixing the different colors. So I'm going to click on this and drop it right down here, right in front of the color ramp. And then this factor here, I'm going to plug this up to the factor on the mix. So just to show you what this is doing, if I just click on this and remove it, if I control shift and click on this, you can see that there is color one and there is color two. So color one is this right here. It's the cracks and color two is this kind of gray color. So what the factor is doing is it's blending in between these two values. So if I just change the factor all the way up to one, it's going to be only using color two. And if I drag this factor all the way down, it's only going to be using color one. But if I take this noise texture and plug the factor into the factor on the mix, it's going to use the data in the noise texture to tell it where it's going to be color one and where it's going to be color two. So right now, you can't really see it doing anything. What I need to do is press shift A, search for another color ramp, and then drop this color ramp right in here in between this connection and then just pull this out. So now this noise texture is going through the color ramp and then going into the factor. And then color two, I want this to be fully white. So I'm going to click on this color two and make it fully white. So now if I control shift and click on this color ramp, I can start to pull these together. So I can just click on these handles, start to pull them together. And you can see now it's getting very contrasty. So some parts are really dark and some parts are really light. Now, if we click on the mix, you can see that something has changed. So where the noise texture is more dark, there's going to be more cracks. And where the texture is light, there's going to be less cracks. So you can see if I drag these both over, so there's more dark, you can see that there's a lot more cracks but if I drag this way down and pull the white way up, now you can see there's very few cracks. So you can just play around with this and get it to how you like. So I'm just going to bring these values to somewhere around here so that there are some cracks some places, but most of the texture doesn't have any cracks. And then also, if you want to play around with the scale, the noise texture, you can do that as well. So you can see that where these dark patches are, that's where the cracks are going to be. And then the rest of it is going to be this color two. So now just make sure that the color on the mix is plugged up to the height. And if you control shift and click on the bump, you can see that some areas have the cracks and some areas don't. So if I control shift and click on the principled shader, let me just pull this over here, you can see that now we have just some areas with cracks and some areas without cracks. So now what I want to do is I want to make those cracks be darker in the color. So wherever the cracks are, they're going to be a darker color. So how I do this is I need to press shift A and I need to search for another mix RGB because we're going to mix the colors. I'm going to plug this one right up here in between the color ramp and the principled, so we can play around with the color values of the material. Now what I need to do is I need to plug the color right here up to the factor for this mix. So you can see if I control shift and click on this, now it's mixing together this mix and this color right here. So what I actually want to do is I want to take this color right here, plug this into the bottom one, so color two, and then remove it from color one. So now what it's doing is it's making the cracks color one and then it's making the rest of it color two, which is the dark dirt. So color one, now we can just make fully black. So if you make it fully black, if you zoom in here, it is pretty subtle, but you can see those cracks are really dark. So now if I control shift and click on the principled, you can see that where those cracks are, it's a lot darker in the material. All right. Now there's just one more thing that I want to do to this material. I want to add some very, very fine detail because when you look at dirt really close up, there's just little, little bits of pieces of dirt and little tiny pebbles and things like that. So I just want to add one more layer of very, very fine detail. So to do this, I'm going to press shift A and search for another Verona texture and just drop this Verona texture way down here. And then once again, this vector, I'm going to plug this all the way down here to the vector of the Verona texture. Now, if I control shift and click on it, you can see what it's doing. It has these little dots here and this is actually what I want. The scale here, I'm going to turn this up to something really high like 200 and you can see that now if I zoom in, there's lots of very, very fine detail. So then what I want to do is I want to use it in the bump. So once again, I'm just going to shift D the bump, drop it right here and then this distance, I'm going to put this into the height and if I control shift and click on this now, you can see this is what's doing. So it's just making a bunch of very, very small detail in the texture. But right now it's way too strong. So the strength here, I'm going to turn this way down, something very small, maybe like a 0.1 and you can see that when I zoom in, there's just a lot more subtle detail. If I press M, you can see here it is without and if I press M again to unmute that, there it is. So it just adds another level of detail in the bump. So if I control shift and click on this now, you can see here is the final material. If I just press control space bar with my mouse over this, you can zoom in here and just see the final material. So it has a lot of detail in there when you zoom in. So there we go. There is the final material and this is rendered with Cycles Render. Now, if you're using Eevee, I'm going to show you how to change the material just a little bit to make it look a little bit nicer in Eevee. So I'm just going to go back here, go back out and then right over here, let me just pull this out. I'm going to change this to Eevee. So now if I go into rendered mode in Eevee, you can see it is going to take a little while to load up the material, but here it is. Now, the thing about Eevee is that these plane lights don't actually work. So I'm going to just delete them and then I'm going to press shift A and instead I need to go to the lights and add some other lights. So I'll just add an area light, bring this over here and turn the power up a little bit because the other lights don't work in Eevee, they only work in Cycles. So you're going to have to use these other lights if you're using Eevee. So I'm just going to duplicate these, just make two lights, just something like that. Maybe turn the strength down a little bit more. Okay, that's pretty good. So you can see with Eevee, if you zoom in here, this dark area looks a little bit weird. It's kind of like too dark. So to change this, what you can do is turn this color here just a little bit lighter, just make it a little bit lighter. It's going to take a little while to load up and then also making it a brown color would also work a bit better. So you can see it's still very, very dark and sharp. So what I find helps is to actually turn down the strength. So this bump right here, the bump that's plugged into the mix, you can just turn down the strength value and that's going to turn down the strength of those cracks. So now if I turn that down, that looks a lot better. So that's what I would do if you're using Eevee just to make it look a little bit different because the Eevee render engine does work a little bit different. So there it is in Eevee. If you wanted to make this material in Eevee, those are the few changes that I would do. So that's how you create this procedural dirt material in Blender.

I hope this tutorial was helpful and I will see you in a future tutorial."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDqRa0ExDqs,Procedural Concrete Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural concrete material. The setup involves using a sphere, camera, plane lights, and an HDRI for lighting. The tutorial guides users through setting up various textures, such as noise and Voronoi, to achieve the desired concrete look, adding color variations, and incorporating cracks and bumps for realism. The video also emphasizes using the NodeWrangler add-on for efficient node management.

If you'd like to get the project files for this tutorial and also help to support me, you can do that over on Gumroad and Patreon. Links will be in the description. So here is the concrete material that we're going to be making. It does look a little bit complex, but I'll walk you through the entire process. So I just wanted to show you the setup that I have before we start. So I just added a sphere right here, and then I have a camera pointed right at it. And then I just have two plane lights. This is for kind of a rim light, and then this is for a main light. And I am going to be using this SmallHanger01 HDRI on HDRI Haven. The link will be in the description if you'd like to download the same one that I'm using. And I just downloaded the 1K version. Then when I added this in to the world settings, I just set the strength at 0.6. And one more thing before we start, I am going to be using the NodeWrangler add-on while setting up this material. So if you don't have the NodeWrangler add-on turned on, what you can do is go Edit, and go to the Preferences. And then right over here on the add-ons, you can just start typing in Node, and you can see that there's this NodeWrangler. Just checkmark that, and then you can close this. Okay, let's add a new material. And I'm just going to call this material Concrete. So now let's go ahead and make the base color for the concrete. So I'm going to press Shift-A here, and I'm going to add a noise texture. Just bring it right over here. And then I'm also going to press Shift-A and add a Voronoi texture. So just add these both right here. And then using one of the features from the NodeWrangler, I'm going to press Ctrl-T. That's going to add this texture coordinate and mapping. I want to plug the object here up to the vector, and then plug the vector here up to the vector on both of these. And that way the Voronoi texture and the noise texture are going to be wrapped around the sphere a little bit better. Now on the noise texture here, I'm going to turn the detail up to 16. And then I'm also going to turn the scale to something up like 100. Something like 100. Now if I Ctrl-Shift and click on the noise texture, you can see what it's doing. So we have a lot of detail there. The distortion here, I'm also going to turn up to like 0.1, just to give it a tiny bit of distortion. And then let's go up here and work on the Voronoi texture. So the scale on the Voronoi texture, I'm going to turn up to like 150. And if I Ctrl-Shift and click on the Voronoi texture, you can see what it's doing. So it's adding all these little dots right in here. Now I want to mix these two together, this one and this one. So I'll press Shift-A and I'm going to search for a mix and add the mix RGB. Just put it right here. And then we're going to put the distance into the top one and the factor of the noise texture into the bottom one. Now, if I Ctrl-Shift and click on it, you can see what it's doing. So it's kind of just mixing the two together. And then this factor value, I can change this up. I'm going to change it to maybe about a 0.8, somewhere around there. And that way it's kind of mixing the two together. Now, right now, if I just plug this mix into the base color and then Ctrl-Shift and click on it, it doesn't really look like concrete. It's way too bright. So we need to tell it what colors we want there to be in the texture. So I'm going to press Shift-A and search for a color ramp. Just drop the color ramp right in here. And then I can Ctrl-Shift and click on it so we can preview it a little bit better. Now, this black value here, I don't want anything to really be fully black. So I'm just going to bring this up and make it just a dark gray. And then this white one here, just select this. I'm just going to make this one kind of a light gray. And then I want to add just a few more colors in here, but they're all kind of going to be gray color. So I'm going to hit this plus button right here, just bring this one over a little bit. And then I'm going to make it just a little bit darker. So just click on this, make it a little bit darker. And you can see that when we make this darker, it kind of makes those lighter parts stand out a little bit more. If I make it even more darker, you can see it's really starting to make that lighter area stand out more. So I don't want to make it too dark, just something like that. And then I want to add one more. So I'm going to click on this plus right here and just make this one a tiny bit darker. And then I think these two dark ones are a little bit too dark. So I'm actually going to click on this, bring it up a little bit, just so it's a little bit less, because that was just a little bit too dark. Something like that. Okay. That looks pretty good. So now if I control shift and click on this, you can see what it's looking like. Now it's a bit too shiny right now. So we want to turn the roughness up to make it a little less shiny. So on the roughness here, I'm going to change this to somewhere around 0.7. And it's definitely less shiny now. We are going to be adding a lot of bump on the normal here, and that'll also make it less shiny. So I'm going to control shift and click back on this. And it does look pretty nice, but I want there to be some patches where it's lighter and some patches where it's darker to give it a little more variation. So to do this, I'm going to just box select all of these and pull them out just so that we have a little bit more room to work with. And then I'm going to click on the noise texture, press shift D to duplicate it and just bring it up here. And then I want to plug the mapping up to the vector just like that. And then what I'm going to do is press shift A here and search for a color ramp. Just drop the color ramp right here and then plug the color up to the factor. Now, if I control shift and click on this, you can see what it's doing. So basically what I'm doing is I'm going to use this as the factor to tell it where the texture is going to be darker and where the texture is going to be lighter. So on the scale here, I'm going to turn this down to like a 10 so that it's a lot less big. And then I'm going to drag these values into each other. Okay. Just bring those in. And I think I want to change the scale down maybe to like a five actually. And then I'm just going to make them somewhat contrasty, kind of like this. So a lot of it is white, but there is a little bit of dark here and we can play around with this a little bit later as well. So now what I want to do is I want to make this have a little bit of darker area and a little bit of lighter area. So I'm going to click on this mix here, press shift D and duplicate it and just drop it right in here. And then I can control shift and click on this. So I'm going to use this as the factor. So the color here, I'm just going to plug this into the factor. And then I want there to be a lighter side and a darker side. So I'm going to bring this up and then I want there to be a lighter version and a darker version of this texture. So it can be darker and lighter. So I'm going to plug this color up to the color here. And then I'm going to press shift a search for RGB curves, click on the RGB curves and just drop it in this bottom one. So just go like this, click. It'll just bring it in there. And then on the C here, I can just click at a point and then drag down and you can see it's going to make it darker. So if I control shift and click on it, this is what we're doing. We're making it darker. So now we have this one that's plugging into the color one. And then this one, this is a bit darker that we're plugging in to color two. So now if I control shift and click on the mix, you can see that it's blending them together using the data that it has right here. So that looks pretty good, but I do want to make it a little more subtle. So I think I'll just bring this back a little bit. And then you could also play around with these if you want to make it a bit stronger or more contrasty or less contrasty, just play around with that. I think I just want to make this maybe a little bit darker. So I'll just pull this down a tiny bit, something like that. Okay. So now just make sure this mix here is going into the base color and we can control shift and click on it. And now you can see that there's a lot more variation in the texture. So this is looking pretty cool, but I do want to add just a little bit of cracks here and there so that the concrete just has a few little cracks and crevices. So what I'm going to do is press shift day and I'm going to search for a Verona texture, and I'm just going to drop it down here underneath these nodes. And then the vector, I'll just plug this up to the vector here. Now, if I control shift and click on it, you can see what it's doing. So to make a texture that looks like cracks, what I'm going to do is click on this F1 here, and I'm going to change this to distance to edge, and you can see what it's doing. Now I'm going to press shift day and search for a color ramp, drop the color ramp right in front of it. And I want to click on the white value and pull it out closer to the black value so that the black areas is just really small. So just make this really, really close so that it's really small, something like that. Now this is starting to look like cracks, but I want to make it much more random. So what I'm going to do is click on this noise texture, press shift to duplicate it and drop it right in here. And then the scale here, I'm going to change to something around like maybe a 1.3, and you can see what it's doing. So the noise texture is going through the vector and then going into the vector here, and it's changing this texture right here. So now it's all kind of wobbly around because before it was just like this, it was just kind of straight. So then if we plug the color here up to the vector, it's going to be kind of all wobbly and just a lot more random. The distortion on this one though, I think I'll turn to zero. You can leave it on if you want, but I'm just going to turn that down to zero. Now you can definitely play around with the scale here because I think right now there's too many cracks. So I'm just going to make it a bit bigger. You could also double tap R in the 3D view and just move this around to a place that you like, something that looks cool, maybe like that. So now I want to plug this into the color and I want to tell it that where those cracks are, it's just going to get darker. So to do this, I'm going to click on this mix here, press shift D to duplicate it so we can mix something with it, drop that right in here. And then this color ramp here, I'm going to plug this up to the color right here. So now if I control shift and click on this, you can see that we've added another one. So now we're mixing this here, which is the cracks, with the rest of the material, which is all this. But you can see that nothing's really happening and that's because I'm going to click on this mix and I'm going to change it to multiply. So if I change it to multiply, now if I change the factor here, if I turn the factor to zero, it's going to be just the regular concrete texture. And if I turn it up to one, it's going to add that on top of it. So this is way too strong. So I'm just going to turn it down to something around maybe a 0.2, something around there. And you can see that now it's very subtle, but the cracks are still there. You could turn it up just a little bit more if you wanted to, but I think it should be pretty subtle. So now if I control shift and click on this, you can see there's just some little crack marks right in there. So now what I want to do is I want to hook this color up to the normal. So I'm going to click on this color, drag it out, and plug it into the normal here. And then I'm going to press shift a, search for a bump node, and just drop it in there because we need to convert it to normal data. And then just plug this from the normal to the height. So the multiply is going into the height, which is going into the normal. Now it's way too strong right now, so I'm just going to click on the strength here, change it to something about a 0.15, something like that. And you can see that it's much more subtle, but it's still there. Now because this multiply here is going into the bump, there is just a very slight bit of bump here where the cracks are, but I want to make the cracks a little bit more bumpy. So I'm actually going to click on this bump here, just maybe bring it up a little bit, then press shift d and just drop it right in here. And then here is the cracks. If I control shift and click on it, you can see there it is. I'm going to plug the color up to the height of the second bump. Now if I control shift and click on it, you can see that now it's adding in that there, and it's a lot stronger. And then you can change the strength if you want to make it a little bit less, you can. I'm just going to control shift and click on this, you can see what it's doing. So this is definitely looking like concrete, but what I want to do is add some little bits that have been kind of cut out, like some little chunks of the concrete. And then I also want to bring some parts of the concrete out, kind of some bigger bumps. So what I'm going to do is just box like this, just bring it up so that we have a little more space down here. So what I'm going to do is just click on this noise texture here, and I'm going to press shift d to duplicate it. We are really piling up on the noise textures here. And then I'm going to plug the vector here up to the vector right down here, all the way down here. And then this color ramp, I'm going to click on this, press shift d to duplicate it, and then just plug the factor up to the factor right here. Now I totally need to change this back down, and then I'm going to control shift and click on it so I can see it. So basically what I want to do is I want to have most of it black, and then I want to have some little bits of it white. So I'm going to drag this black value up, and then drag the white down. And then also the scale, I need to make it a lot bigger. Stuff to work with, something like that, and then just keep dragging that. Because what this is going to be is the little white parts here are going to be chunks that have kind of been broken out of the concrete. So there's going to be some little kind of crevices and holes here. And then I think I'll change the scale up a little bit more, bring the black down a bit, something like that. So now what I'm going to do is again click on the bump, shift d, duplicate it, drop it down here so we have another one. The color right here, I'm going to plug this into the height of this one, and then if I control shift and click on it you can see what it's doing. Now right now these little pieces right here, they're coming out. I want them to go back in, so I'm going to click on the invert. And now you can see that now they're cutting into the concrete. And then the strength here, if you want to turn this up a little bit you definitely could, to make the chunks a little bit bigger. I don't want to turn up too much, but just a little bit. So now we have these little chunks that have been broken out of the concrete. So now what I want to do is just do that one more time, but I want to have some parts that are coming out. So I'm going to click on the noise texture and then shift click on the color ramp, press shift d to duplicate, bring them down here, and then once again this mapping needs to go all the way down to the vector. And then if I control shift and click on this you can see what it's doing. Now for this I want to drag this out over here so that it's mostly white, and then also I don't want the cracks to be as the same as this, so I'm going to change the scale and I'm just going to make it just a little bit smaller, and that way the noise texture is going to be a little bit different from this one. And then what I want to do is this black here, I'm actually going to drag it up and make it more gray, so it's a little less contrasty, maybe not that much, a little bit down. And then what I need to do is go back over here, click on a bump, press shift d to duplicate it, drop it in here, and then this color right here goes all the way into the height, and then let me just control shift and click on this. Now you can see that right now it's going in, I can turn off the invert, and now it's going to be coming out. And then it's too strong right now so I'm going to bring it way down, and then I'm still going to control shift and click on the last bump here, and just go back over here, and then I can also play around with this if I want to make it more or less. I can also turn this color down a bit. So now if I control shift and click back on the principled BSDF, you can see the final material. Now some concrete is a little bit more smooth and some concrete is a little more rough, so if you want to make the bump bigger on any of these or all of them, you could do that, and then the concrete is going to be a lot more rough, or you could turn it down as well and make it a little less rough. And then also if you want to make the cracks a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger, you can click on the color ramp here, and you can just drag this down even more, and you can see that now these little black lines here are going to get even smaller, or if you want to make the cracks bigger, you can turn it up just like that. And then if you want to make the cracks a little bit more visible or a little bit less visible, I'm going to control shift and click on the multiply, and if you turn up the factor it's going to make it stronger, and if you turn the factor down it's going to be harder to see. And then of course you can also control shift and click on the second bump and turn the strength up for that if you want to make the cracks a little bit stronger. So now I'm just going to press F12 and render this out. So there we go, there is the finished concrete material. Now again these project files are going to be available on my Gumroad and Patreon, so if you'd like to get the project files you can check that out with the link in the description, and that'll also help to support me. But thank you so much for watching, I hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and I hope it was helpful, and I will see you in a future video."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wccIBwnfhrM,Procedural Tile Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make a procedural tile material in Blender, suitable for architectural scenes like modern bathroom renders. The process involves setting up a scene with a sphere, lights, and an HDRI for realistic lighting. The tutorial covers using Blender's Node Wrangler add-on to create a tile texture with a brick texture node, adjusting its scale and mortar size, and enhancing it with bump and noise textures for added realism. The creator also shows how to mix colors and control the material's roughness to create a shiny tile effect. The tutorial concludes with rendering the material, applying denoise in the compositing tab, and saving the final image. Project files are available for download via Gumroad and Patreon.","In this tutorial, we're going to be creating this procedural tile material in Blender. So if you're making like an architecture scene, maybe you're making one of those like modern bathroom renders, then you could put this maybe on the floors or on the walls or something like that. Also, if you want to download the project files, they're going to be available on my Gumroad and Patreon, links in the description. So before we start, I just wanted to show you the scene that I have set up. So I just have this sphere right here, and then I have a camera pointed right at it. And then I just have two lights, one here for a rim light, and then one here for the front light, just like that. And then I'm also using an HDRI to get some more realistic lighting. So if you want to use the same HDRI that I'm using, the link will be in the video description. And then one more thing, I am going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you don't have that enabled, you can go to edit and then go to preferences. And then on the add-ons tab right here, you can type in Node Wrangler and just checkmark that. Okay, let's get started now. So I'm just going to hit on this new button, and I can just call it tile. Let's zoom in here. I'm going to press shift A, and I'm going to search for the brick texture. So we'll just drop the brick texture right down here. And then I'm going to press control T, and that will add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes. Now I'm going to plug the object up to the vector because I'm using a sphere, and I want to place this texture on a sphere. But if you have something like a floor or a wall or something, then it's probably better to UV unwrap your object and then plug the UV into the vector, or just use generated, whatever you want to do. So I can control shift and click on the brick texture now, and we can see what it looks like. And right now this is too detailed, too small. So on the scale here, I just want to make the scale, make the bricks bigger. And then this mortar size, that's going to be the little black areas in between the bricks. I'm going to make this a lot smaller to something like 0.004, just so that it's a lot thinner. Now I want this to contribute to the bump as well as the color later on, but first I'm going to do the bump. So I'll plug this color into the normal, and then I'll press shift A, search for a bump node, and then drop the bump node in between this, and then plug this color up to the height, and that'll convert it to data that the normal can use. So now you can see it's making the mortar kind of go in, and then the tiles are coming out. And now if I control shift and click back on the principle, you can see what it's doing. Now it's a little hard to see, so this base color, I will just make it a bit darker. Now you can see that bump really working. All right, so now I want this brick texture to also contribute to the color. So I'm just going to drop the color into the base color, but you can see that it's just white and black, and that's kind of boring. I want to make it kind of a gray color and a slightly blue color. So what I'll do is press shift A, search for a color ramp, and we'll drop the color ramp right in here, and I'm just going to bring it up a little bit. And then let's change these colors. So right now I'm just going to click on this, drag it out a little bit, and I'll just make it a very slight gray-blue color. So you can see right here when the light is shining on the material, it's very smooth. I want to give it just a little bit of roughness to give it a little more variation, so I'll press shift A. I'm going to search for a noise texture, and I'll just bring the noise texture right above this, and then the vector right here, I'm going to plug this into the vector here. And then what I need to do is click on this bump, press shift D to duplicate it, and just drop it right in front of the other one. And then I will plug this factor into the height. Now you can see this is way too strong right now, so what I'm going to do is just bring this strength way down. I'm going to bring this down to like a 0.02, so it's very small. If you click on this, you can still see it, and you will be able to see it better once we make this material more shiny. So I think just something like a 0.02, just something really subtle, is going to be great. Okay, now I also want this noise to contribute to the color, because I want to have just a little bit of slight random color. So what I'll do is this color ramp, I'm going to press shift D and duplicate it, just bring it up here. And then this factor, I'm going to plug it into this new color ramp. Now I can control shift on this color ramp, and you can see what it's doing. What I want to do is make this side of it be a very slightly blue, kind of a gray color. And then this other one, I want to be kind of a light blue. But I don't want them to be super contrasted, because if this is really dark, you can see that's pretty contrasty. I want them to be pretty subtle, so just something like that. Now I want to mix these two together so that they can both contribute to the color. So I'll press shift A, and I'm going to search for a mix RGB, and I'm just going to drop this down in the bottom one that's plugging into the base color. And then I can plug this one up to the bottom one here. Now if I control shift and click on it, you can see what it's doing. And what I actually want to do is this color here, I want to change it into the factor. So I'll plug that into the factor. And what the factor does is it's telling on the mesh where it's going to be color 1, and where it's going to be color 2. So color 2 is this material right here, and then color 1 is this light material. What we're going to do is make it all the way to black, and now it's really contrasty, and it looks really cool. And then this here, I actually want to make this a little bit brighter now that we've made it really dark. And this also, this black color also makes the mortar really dark, and I think that looks really good because it kind of makes it stand out a bit more. But this color ramp right here that the noise texture is going into, I want to make it a little bit brighter now, because this black color made it so dark. So I'm just going to make it a little bit brighter. Also, I think I want to change the scale up a bit, so I'm going to make it more like 10. And that way there's just a little more detail in there. Okay, now if I control shift and click on it, you can see what it looks like. That's really starting to look cool. If you want to make it a little bit more blue, you could make this a little bit more saturated, both of these colors. So if they're all the way in the center, they're not going to have any saturation, but if you move them way out, they're going to be more and more saturated. So I'm just going to make it just a tad bit more saturated, so it's just a slight bit more blue. All right, so this is looking pretty good, but this kind of bathroom tile is usually pretty shiny, and you can see this isn't super shiny. So what I'm going to do is plug this mix into the roughness. So what I want to do now is make the mortar. You can see in there, I want to make that rough, because that's usually kind of a pretty rough material. But then where the tiles are, I want to make that pretty shiny, so we can actually control where it's rough and where it's shiny. So I'm going to press shift A, search for another color ramp, and we'll drop this color ramp right in here, in between the mix and the roughness. Now, if I control shift and click on this color ramp, you can see what it's doing. What I want to do is switch these so that this one's white, and then this one's black, and I'll just bring it down and make it more and more contrasty. You can see this is really white, the mortar, and that means it's going to be really rough. So you can see it's not shiny at all, but the tile is really shiny. So it's reflecting that, but then right here, it's not shiny at all. It's pretty rough. But if I move over, you can see that these areas where it's darker, where the tile is darker, it's not shiny, but then where it's lighter, it is super shiny. And you could keep it like that if you wanted to, but I actually want to change it so that the tile is all the same shininess, but then the mortar is still dark. So to fix this, I'm going to actually duplicate this color ramp and put it right in front of this one, and then I'll control shift and click on this. And then what I want to do is bring these two together really close, so it'll make it really contrasty. And now you can see that there's only two colors. There's the mortar, and then there's the brick. And you can see now that we've changed these colors and made it super contrasty. If I control shift and click back on this, you can see now it's doing the opposite effect. So the mortar is really shiny, and then the brick is not shiny at all. So we actually want to switch these. So just bring this one down here, the black one over here, and then the white one over here. And now you can see it's again much more shiny, and the mortar is really black. Now right now, this is pretty much like a mirror. It's like super, super shiny. So to make this less shiny, a little more rough, this black color, I'm just going to turn it up. And the more you turn it up, the less shiny it's going to get, because when it's fully white, it's not shiny at all. And when it's fully dark, it's super shiny. So you can just take this black color, just drag it up a bit. And you can see now it's really not shiny, but I want it to be pretty shiny. So I'll just drag it to somewhere that looks good. I think that looks pretty good. That's maybe a little too shiny. So I'll just make it a little bit more rough. And now you can see if I move down here, even where there's the darker tiles, they're the same amount of shininess as the lighter tiles. So there we go. That's the material. I'm going to press F12 to render this out. And then once it's done rendering, we're going to add a denoise node just to smooth out the noise and make it look a little bit nicer. And I really like how if you zoom in here, you can see the edges of the tile. It's reflecting a little bit of light right there. I really like that. It kind of makes it stand out and look cooler. Okay, so the render is finished now. You can also see that that little bit of noise that we added, you're really able to see that. If you think it's too strong, you could right here, if I control shift and click, go back here. This one right here, you could make it less strong, like even a 0.01 if you want. I'm just going to leave it at 0.02, but you could make it less strong if you wanted. Okay, so I'm going to go over to the compositing tab and you can see you're going to need to hit use nodes. And then you can see your composite and your render layers. Now to preview this, I'm going to control shift and click on the render layers. And now you should be able to see it behind you. And if you don't see the render behind you, you can click on the backdrop and that'll show it. And then if it's too big or too small, you can press V to zoom it out and alt V to zoom it in. All right, so now let's add that denoise. So I'll press shift A, just search for a denoise node, drop it in between the render layers and composite, and then I can control shift and click on the denoise. So right now the background is transparent because I rendered it out as a transparent background. You can see the film right here. I just rendered that out as transparent. So if you did that and you want to add some kind of color in the background, you can press shift A, search for an alpha over node, drop the alpha over node right in there. And then this one's actually going to need to go into the bottom one and the top one, that's going to be whatever background you want to have it. So I want to have a maybe really dark blue color. Okay, and then to save this image, what I'm going to do is go back to this rendering tab. And then right here, this is the render result. So it's what rendered, but this doesn't have all the compositing that we did. So I'm going to click right here, then click on the viewer node. And now we can see the finished image. So now I'm going to go right here and go to image and click on save as. So there we go. That's the finished procedural tile material. Again, if you want to support me and also download the project files, this is going to be available on my Gumroad and Patreon. So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and I hope it was helpful. Thank you for watching, and I will see you in a future video."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suoF5H1Ro8E,Procedural Sand (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor guides viewers through the process of creating a procedural sand material. The tutorial includes details on setting up the scene with lighting, using the NodeWrangler add-on, and applying various textures and nodes like wave, noise, bump, and color ramp to achieve a realistic sand effect. The instructor also offers tips on adjusting colors and details to mimic real sand and concludes with rendering and compositing the final image. Viewers are encouraged to download project files from the instructor's Gumroad and Patreon for further support.","In this Blender tutorial, we're going to be creating this procedural sand material. Now if you want to download the project files for this, it's going to be available on my Gumroad and Patreon. I'll leave links in the video description. Now before we start, I just wanted to show you the setup that I have here. So I have this main light shining on this sphere right here. And then I also have a backlight to get a rim light. And then I just have a camera pointed right at the sphere. And I'm also using an HDRI to get a little more realistic lighting. So if you want to use the same HDRI that I'm using, the link will be in the video description for that. Okay, let's start. So just select whatever object you want to add the sand material onto. And then just click on New. And I'm going to be using the NodeWrangler add-on. If you don't have that enabled, you can go Edit and then go to Preferences. And then on the add-on tabs right here, you can search for NodeWrangler and just checkmark that. Okay, let's close this now. So I'm going to first press Shift-A and I'm going to search for a wave texture. We'll just add this wave texture in right here. Now because I'm putting this texture on a sphere, I'm going to press Ctrl-T and add this texture coordinate and mapping node. And I'm going to plug the object up to the vector. Now if you have like a more flat surface or something that you want to add the sand onto, maybe you're making like a desert scene or a beach scene, you may want to use UV and UV unwrap the mesh. Or you may just want to leave it at generated. But I'm going to set it to object. Okay, now let's Ctrl-Shift and click on the wave texture and we can see what it's doing. I'm going to double tap R and just rotate my sphere around a bit so that we're looking at it from the front and also rotate it sideways a little bit. Okay, let's change the scale down because I don't want there to be that many waves. And then the distortion, let's turn this up a little bit so that it's a bit more random. So it looks a bit more realistic. And then the detail here, I also want to turn this up just a little bit, not too high, but just give it a little bit more detail right in there. Okay, now let's plug this wave texture up to the normal and then I'm going to press Shift-A, search for a bump node and we'll drop the bump node in right here and plug this up to the height. So now if I Ctrl-Shift and click on the principal, you can now see what it's doing. So it's adding those waves right in there. Now right now it's really sharp. If I zoom in here, you can see the edges are very sharp and I want to smooth that out. So to smooth it out, I'll press Shift-A. I'm going to search for a color ramp node and I'll drop the color ramp node right in here. Now, if I click on this white tab right here and I make it darker, you can see that it's smoothing out those edges. If I just Ctrl-Shift and click on the bump node, you can see what it's doing here. So if I make it darker, it's going to smooth out those edges and eventually just smooth it so much that it's going to be flat. So I just want to make it a bit darker, pretty dark, so that those edges right there are smooth because this is probably something that like if you're making a desert scene, maybe the wind has blown these kind of waves here or maybe if the tide is coming in, the water going back and forth is making these waves right here. And then also the strength, I think I want to turn this down a bit because it is kind of strong. So I'll turn it a bit more down. Okay, I'm going to Ctrl-Shift and click back on this. You can see it's starting to look pretty cool. This base color for the time being, I'm just going to make it kind of a yellowy color, but we'll go ahead later and add more color to that. Now I also want to add some little tiny detail because you can see on these pictures right up here on the screen that really close up, sand is very detailed and it has lots of different colors and little bits of bump. So to add those little tiny bits of detail, I'm going to press Shift-A, search for a noise texture. We'll drop the noise texture underneath the wave and then I'll plug this vector up to the vector here. Now I want to duplicate this bump so that we can add this noise texture into the bump. So I'll press Shift-D, drop it here. And then the factor on the noise texture, I'm going to plug that up to the height. And now you can see it's adding in a lot of detail. Now I want to make this a lot bigger, so I'm going to change the scale to something like 200, so that it has a lot more detail, maybe even more like 250, so that it's very, very detailed. And also the detail right here, I'm going to turn this all the way up to 16 so that it has the maximum amount of detail. Now if you can Control-Shift and click on the bump, you can see what it's doing. It's adding in all that little tiny bits of bump there. Now this is actually too strong, so I'm going to turn this down to something like a 0.1 or a 0.2, something like that, so that we can still see that wave texture there. So now if I Control-Shift and click back on the principal, you can see what it's doing. If I zoom in here, it's just giving it a little bit of detail. Now it is really starting to look like sand. I think I will turn this strength up a little bit on the first bump. But you can see here in these images that sand has lots of little bits of color. It's mostly usually kind of a yellowish color, but sand is made up of a bunch of little broken up pieces of rock, and so the different rocks are different colors, so there's lots of tiny little variation. So to add these little bits of variation in the texture, I'm going to click on this noise texture, press Shift-D to duplicate it, and just bring it up here. And then the mapping, I'll plug this into the vector. Now the factor here, I'm going to plug this into the base color. But you can see that right now, if I Control-Shift and click on the noise texture, it's just white and black, so we need to add colors in between that. So I'm going to press Shift-A, search for a ColorRamp node, and I'll just drop the ColorRamp node right in here, and then Control-Shift and click on it. Now I've found that this ColorRamp is super important to actually making the texture look good or look bad. So I'm going to be pretty specific to what colors I'm adding and where I'm adding them, so that hopefully you'll have the best result possible. So this black value, I'm going to pull it out, and I'm going to bring it to a position of about 0.25. You can see right here, there's the position. I'm going to bring it to somewhere around 0.25, and then I'm going to make the color a dark brown color. Now this white one, I'm going to drag it out and bring it to a position at about 0.42 or 0.43, just somewhere around there. And then this white color, I'm going to change this to kind of a peachy color. Make it pretty bright, as bright as you can, not super saturated, just something like that. Okay, now I'm going to click on this plus button. That'll add a new one in there, and you can see this is pretty much the color that I want. I'm going to make it a little bit darker, and then I'm going to drag this one over here, and I'm going to drag it to somewhere around 0.65 or 0.67, so somewhere around there. And then let's add another one, so I'll click on the plus button, bring this over here. This one, I want to be kind of a pink, kind of tan, kind of in between pink and peach, I guess. So something like this, and make it pretty bright. And this one, I'm going to drag to somewhere around 0.7, so somewhere nearby that. Now let's click on the plus button again. I'm going to add another one, bring it over here. I'm going to put this one somewhere around 0.76, somewhere around there. And then this one, I actually want it to be kind of a very slightly blue-gray color, because some of the little tiny rocks I found, they seem to have a little bit of gray in them, so I'll just bring that to somewhere around there. You can see what this is starting to look like. And then I want to add one more, so I'll click on the plus button, drag this over here. And then this one, I'm going to drag it to somewhere around 0.87, and I'm going to make this one a yellow color. A little bit more yellow, a little bit more saturated, something like that. And then this is how it's looking now. Alright, so hopefully your sand looks something like this, something similar. Let me just go back here. Now if I control shift and click on the principle, this is what it's looking like. So if I zoom way in, it doesn't look quite like sand, but looking at it from like this far away, I think it looks a lot like sand. Now one more thing that I want to do, I want to press shift-D and duplicate this, drop it in here, so we have another one, and then I'll take this color and drop it into the height. Now I don't want this to be too strong, but I will change it to somewhere around 0.25 or something like that. Oh, not 2.5, 0.25. There we go. And now if I zoom way in, you can see it's bumping out that white and pushing in the dark, and if I zoom out here, you can see it looks a lot like sand. Okay, so let's render this out. So I'm going to press F12 to render out the image. Alright, it's finished rendering now. So let's click over on this compositing tab. We'll just do a little bit of compositing. And here you can see, if you click on use nodes, it's going to have a render layers and composite. And then I'm going to control shift and click on the render layers so that we can preview what it's looking like. Now if this background image is way too big, you're probably going to have to press V to zoom out and Alt V to zoom in. And if you don't see this background image, you can just click on this backdrop and you should see it. Okay, now I want to add a denoise node to smooth it out because it's pretty rough right now. So I'll press shift A, search for a denoise node, drop it in here between the render layers and composite, and then I'll control shift and click on the denoise. And now it's going to smooth it all out. Now, if you want to add a background, I'm going to press shift A, search for an alpha over. This is totally optional, of course. I'm just going to drop it in here. And then this one, I'm going to plug to the bottom one. And then this white right here, this will be whatever background you want. So in the image that I showed at the starting, I just kind of made it like a blue color, maybe to look like the water from the beach. And then to save this image, I can go over to this rendering tab. And then right here, I can click on this, go to viewer nodes that we can see what the viewer node is seeing. And then I can go image and click on save as and just save that image to my computer. So there we go. That's the procedural sand material. Thank you for watching. I hope this tutorial was helpful. And again, if you want to download the project files and also help support me, there will be my Patreon and Gumroad links in the video description. But thank you for watching and I'll see you in a future video."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq25CWtsLBY,Procedural Rock Material (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor demonstrates how to create a procedural rock shader using Blender's shader nodes without any textures. The project files are available for download on Patreon and Gumroad. The tutorial includes steps to set up lighting using an HDR from HDRI Haven and additional lights for enhanced scene aesthetics. The process involves creating a high-density mesh with an Icosphere, applying a displacement modifier, and using various nodes like noise texture, bump, and color ramp to develop a realistic rock appearance. The tutorial also highlights the use of the Node Wrangler add-on and addresses the limitations of using the ""pointiness"" feature in Eevee compared to Cycles. Finally, the instructor advises on rendering settings and post-processing using the compositor to denoise the image.","In this Blender tutorial, I'm going to be showing you how to make this procedural rock shader in Blender. Now, if you want to download the project files, they're going to be available on my Patreon and Gumroad. The links will be in the video description. So we're not going to be using any textures, all we're going to be doing is using Blender's shader nodes to create this procedurally. Now, with that said though, I am going to be using this Blue Grotto HDR on HDRI Haven, and I'm just using the 1K version. So if you want to download this HDR, the link will be in the video description for that, and I'm just using this because it gives some really nice, realistic lighting, and I think it makes the scene look nicer. But this is totally optional, you definitely don't have to use this, you can light your scene however you'd like. Now I am going to be using a couple lights here, I'm going to have this backlight right here for a rim light, and then also this main light just pointed at the scene. And then I also have the camera right here, and it's just pointed at the center of the scene. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A, and I'm going to add an Icosphere. Now on the Icosphere settings, I'm going to add 8 subdivisions, now this is pretty high, and depending on what computer you have, you may not be able to handle 8 subdivisions, it might get kind of laggy or might crash, because if I tab into edit mode here, you can see that this is a pretty high-dense mesh. So definitely be careful with this, if your computer can't quite handle this and it's a little bit laggy, then you may need to go with something like 6 or 7 subdivisions or something like that. Now if you have a 3D model of a rock, or maybe you've sculpted a rock, and you want to just add the material onto that 3D model, then you can definitely just add that in and throw the material on it. But for this demonstration, I'm going to be using this Icosphere, and just make a really high-dense mesh. Now why I'm making this really high-dense mesh is because I'm going to be adding a displacement modifier to give the rock kind of bumps and stuff, so if you want to add that displacement modifier, I definitely suggest making whatever mesh you're going to use a really high topology like this. But if you already have a rock 3D model created, and you don't want to add a displacement modifier, then that's totally fine and you don't need to make it super high-dense. Here is the finished result right here, and there's one thing that I wanted to mention. If you're doing this tutorial in Eevee, I'm going to be using this geometry with this pointiness value, and what this does is it makes the parts that are going in darker, and then the other parts that are coming out lighter. And this feature, this pointiness value, doesn't work in Eevee. So if you're doing this in Eevee, then this isn't going to work. You can definitely do this tutorial in Eevee, but it may not look quite as good. Let me just hop over to Eevee just to show you what it's going to look like. And you can see I just added a few lights in here just so that you can see what it's looking like. So this is what it looks like in Eevee. It does look pretty cool, but I think it definitely looks better in Cycles. All right, so once you've added this material, I'm just going to call it rock. So the first thing that we're going to be doing is adding a noise texture, and we're going to be putting that into the normal to add some bump. So I'm going to press Shift-A and search for a noise texture. Just add it in right here. And then I'm going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on. If you don't have that enabled, you can go Edit, go to Preferences, and then on the Add-ons tab right here, you can just search for Node Wrangler. So this is a really great add-on. I use it all the time. So I just checkbox that, and then you can just close this. Now, if you Control-Shift and click on the noise texture, then you can see, you can preview what the node is showing, and that's the feature of the Node Wrangler. So you can see there's the noise texture now. It's placed on the sphere. I'm going to, with this selected, press Control-T, and that's going to add this texture coordinate and mapping nodes. And then this object here, I'm going to plug this into the vector. And what that's going to do is it's going to place the noise texture on the sphere a little bit better. Because instead of using generated, we're going to be using object mapping. Now, if we Control-Shift and click back on the principled, you can see what it's looking like, and let's just plug the factor into the normal. Now, you can see that it's looking really weird, and that's because we need to convert this to normal data so that the principled can use it. So let's press Shift-A. We're going to search for a bump. And now we can just place this right in between here, and then plug the factor up to the height. And that way, it's going to convert it to normal data. And then also, this base color, I'm just going to make this a lot darker so that we can see it a little bit better. Okay, now you can see that it doesn't really look like rock. It's pretty boring right here. So what I'm going to do to make it look a lot like rock is this detail here. We can turn this way up. I'm going to turn it up all the way to 16. And suddenly, this looks a lot more like rock. We still need to do some things to make it look better, but it's already looking a lot like rock. So now let's go ahead and add that displacement. So again, if you don't want to add this displacement, you definitely don't have to, but I think it adds a lot and makes it look a lot better. So over here on this wrench here, this is the Modifiers tab. I'm going to click on Add Modifier. And then let's add the Displace modifier. Now, you can see that it just makes it really big. We want to add a texture, so I'm going to click on New here. And then we can go over to the texture settings by clicking on this button or by going over here to the texture panel. So let's just hop over there. Now, right now it's set to Image or Movie. That's something that you would add into Blender. I want to click on this and change it to Clouds. And you can see that when you add those clouds, it looks really weird. It definitely looks like a cloud, but it's way too strong right now. And another thing that I'm going to do is this Noise Basis. Instead of the Blender original, I'm going to change this to Voronoi Crackle. And you can see what it does. It makes this really cool look right here. I'm going to change the size to 1 so that it's a lot bigger. And you can see it's starting to look a lot more like rock. Now, if you want to leave it this strong, you could. It does kind of look cool. So I don't want this to be that strong because it's way too strong for me. So I'm going to click back over here onto the modifiers. And then this Strength here, I can just turn this down. So I'm going to change this value to like a 0.05. And you can see now it's way less strong, but you can still see it. If you want to turn it up a little bit more, you could. Maybe a 0.06, maybe even a 0.07. If you want to, you could turn it up a little bit more. And now you can see that after adding that displacement, it looks a lot more like rock. Now, if I press Z and move my mouse over to go back into solid mode, you can see this is why I wanted to add so much detail because you can see that it's using that geometry to bump this out. So if you have a low resolution mesh, it's not going to look as high quality. Now, I'm also going to click on this mesh and Shade Smooth. So you can just click on Object and click on Shade Smooth right here to smooth that out. And then let's hop back into rendered mode. So it's looking pretty good, but we don't really have any interesting colors right now. It's just the base color, which is just a plain kind of dark gray color. So we're going to be making the colors now and then plugging that into the base color to make it look more interesting. So I'm actually going to be using this noise texture mapping and texture coordinate. So I'm going to press A to deselect everything and then B and just box select these and then I'll press Shift D, duplicate these and just move them up here. And then I can Control Shift and click on the noise texture. Now, I want to make the scale of this a lot bigger. So like 80 or I guess a lot smaller. You can see that now it has a lot more detail there and then that really doesn't look like rock. It's just like a black and white. So I want to add different colors into this. So I'll press Shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp node. So I'll drop this color ramp node right in here so that we can preview it and then I'm going to pull this out a bit and then I'm going to make this black color kind of a dark gray, maybe make it a little bit brighter. So you can see it's a nice gray color now. This one, I'm going to pull this out here and then this one I'm going to make a slightly brown kind of dark color, kind of a dark gray slightly brown color. And then I want to make one more in the middle here. So I'm going to click on the plus button. You can see I added it in the middle. You can just put it in the middle there and then this one I want to make just a slight blue because it seems like some rock has just a tiny tiny tad bit of blue. And of course you can change these colors up and make them how you like. All right, and that's looking pretty good now. So I'm going to plug this color here into the base color and then control shift and click on this just to preview it. Also rocks aren't very shiny. So real quick, this roughness here, I think I might turn this up to like a 0.6 or 0.7, maybe a 0.65. Now this is starting to look good, but there's a few things that I want to add to it. One thing that I want to add is I want to make the parts that are coming out lighter and then the crevices and creases, I want to make those darker. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a geometry node. I'm just going to add this in here. And then as I said at the beginning, I'm going to be using the pointiness value and this doesn't seem to work in Eevee. So if you're doing this in Eevee, then you're not really going to see anything with this node. Okay, so now if we control shift and click on this pointiness, you're going to need to hold down control and shift and keep on clicking until it goes to the pointiness. Oh, let me just keep on clicking. There we go. Now if you zoom in here, you can see that it's starting to add that. You can see there's lighter and darker areas, but I want to make that a lot more contrasty. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a color ramp. So just drop this in here and then we can preview what it's looking like. Now I'm going to pull these together and that way it's going to give more contrast. So I'll drag these together. You can see the darker areas are dipping in and then the kind of corners and lighter areas are coming out. Okay, and now I want to mix this together with our other color. So what I'm going to do is press shift A, search for a mix RGB, just drop that in here. And then what I want to do is plug this into the bottom one, make the top one black and then actually this right here, this isn't going to go into the color. This is going to go into the factor. So what this factor does is it tells it what's going to be color 2 and what's going to be color 1. So color 2 is this. If I control shift and click on it, you can see what it's looking like and then color 1 is going to be the black. And then the color ramp is telling it where there's going to be this color and where there's going to be black. So now if we control shift and click on it, you can see that the dark areas are black and then the lighter areas are this color right here. Now right now it's way too black. So I'm going to actually pull this out a bit to make it a little bit brighter, make it a little bit more contrasty because we definitely want it to be brighter. And that looks pretty good. That looks pretty good. Okay, so now if I control shift and click back on the principle, you can see that now the darker areas are kind of more defined and it just looks a little bit nicer. All right, now there's one more thing that I want to add to this material. If I control shift and click on this, you can see that it's kind of all the same and there's just a bunch of random noise. But what I want to do is I want to add some areas that are darker and some areas that are lighter. So what I'm going to do is click on this, shift, click on this so that they're both selected. I'll press shift D to duplicate them, just move them up here. And then I'll plug this up to here so that the mapping is the same. And then I just want this, if I control shift and click on it so I can see it. Actually, I'll click on this one. This here, I want this to be way smaller. So something like a four or five. And now you can see that there's some big parts that are lighter and darker. Now this one, I'm going to delete it. So I'll select it and then press the minus and that'll delete it. And then this one here, I want to make it darker so there's more contrast. So I'll bring this down so that it's darker. And then this, I'll make it a little bit lighter. And then I want to mix that together so that some of the parts are a bit lighter and some of the parts are a bit darker. So what I'm going to do actually is press A to deselect everything. I'll press B, box select this area and just kind of bring it out so that we have a little bit more room here. And then this mix here, I can select it and I'll press shift D to duplicate it and bring it up here and just drop it right in between these two so that we can mix these two together. So now what I'm going to do is this color here, I'm going to plug this into the bottom one. And then if I control shift and click on this, you can see what it's doing. This mix here, I'm actually going to change this to darken and that looks a bit better. And you can see now some parts are lighter and some parts are darker but it's still using that very fine detail. And then if you want to play around with this factor here, I find that if you turn it up, it's a little bit better so there's some parts that are darker, some parts that are lighter. Also, if you want to play around with the scale here, that'll change how much is lighter and darker. I think I'll actually make it a little bit smaller. And then if we control shift and click back on the principle here, you can see that now it just looks a little bit nicer. Now, you may feel like it's a little bit hard to see it. You can see the texture if you zoom in but it might be a little bit hard to see. If you want to make it even more defined, what you can do is press shift A, search for a brightness and contrast and then just plug it right in here. So right before it goes into the principle. And then if I control shift and click on it, you can see this is what it looks like. If I turn up the brightness, it's going to make everything brighter, of course, but then if I turn up the contrast, it'll make everything darker. So I can just turn that way up and then turn the contrast way up as well and just make it more and more contrasty. And then you can see if I have this selected and I press M to mute it, you can see this is what it looks like before and then if I press M, this is what it looks like after. So it's just a little bit brighter and a little bit nicer. So now I can control shift and click on this and then one more thing that I want to do is I want to add this color here into the bump. So I'll click on this, press shift D to duplicate it and just drop it right here. And then this color here, I can add it into the height and then if I control shift and click on it, you can see that it's way too strong right now because that's going to make it look, I think, too strong. So if I just click on this, I can just make it way less. So I'm just going to make it something around 0.1 or 0.2 maybe and then if I click back on this, it just adds a little more detail and it kind of bumps out where the different areas are here on the color. All right, so that's pretty much it for the material. I'm going to go here and go render, render image or you can press F12 to render out the image. And then once this is done rendering, I'm going to throw it into the compositor and add a denoise node to denoise the image. Okay, so it's done now. Let's go over to the compositor and then I'll click on use nodes right here. Now you can see here's the render layers and composite. What I'm going to do is press shift A. I'm going to search for a denoise node. Just drop the denoise node right in there and then I can press control shift and click on the denoise node and that'll denoise the image. Now if I go back to the rendering tab or press F11, you can see here's the image. Right now up here, it's set to render result. I want to change this to viewer nodes that it's going to show the denoised image. So to save this image, you can go image and click on save as and save it right there. And then two things I wanted to mention really quick if you want to make this look a little bit better. The strength here, I think this might look a little bit better if it's only at like 0.1 and then over here on the texture panel, I think this might look better if it's a little bit less detail. So I'm going to make the number bigger and that way there will just be a little bit less of that Veroni cracking right there. I'll just render that again and there we go. So there's the finished material. So I hope this tutorial was helpful and I hope you enjoyed it. Again, if you want to get the finished project files, they're going to be available on my Patreon and that'll also help to support me. So again, thanks for watching and I'll see you in a future video."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3J1Sz8y3zQ,Procedural Clay Shader (Blender Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, the instructor demonstrates how to create a procedural clay shader using Blender's shader nodes without relying on any textures. The tutorial covers setting up the scene with lighting, camera, and HDRI for realistic lighting, and emphasizes using the Node Wrangler add-on for efficient node management. The process involves creating color variations with a noise texture and color ramp, adjusting roughness to mimic clay's appearance, and adding bump maps for texture detail. The tutorial concludes with rendering the image, applying a denoise node in the compositor, and saving the final result. The project files are available for download on the instructor's Gumroad and Patreon.","In this Blender tutorial we're going to be making this procedural clay shader in Blender. Here is the finished result you can see right here and you can see that we're not going to be using any textures. All we're going to be doing is using Blender's shader nodes to create this. Now here's the scene that I have right here. So I have these two lights right here and then I have a sphere to display the material and then I have this camera pointed right at the sphere. Now I am going to be using an HDRI to get a little bit more realistic lighting. You don't have to use this if you don't want to, it's totally optional. But if you want to use the same way that I'm using, I'm using this PumpHouse 1K HDR on HDRI Haven. I'll leave a link in the video description to that if you want to download it. But this is totally optional, you can definitely just light it however you want and then make the materials within Blender. Now two more things before we get started. The first one is that down here on the color management in the render properties I'm going to be using Filmic Blender because this helps to have more accurate lighting and then on the look here I'm going to be using High Contrast. And then the last thing is that I'm going to be using the Node Wrangler add-on. So if you don't have this enabled you can go edit and then go to preferences and then on the add-ons here you can search for Node Wrangler. So you can just check mark that and then you can just close this. Alright so here we are and let's get started. So I'm just in the camera mode here, I'm in the shading tab and I have the nodes right down here and I'm just going to call this material clay. And then I'm just going to go into rendered mode so that we can preview what it's looking like. So first I'm going to start out by making the color so I'm going to press shift a and I'm going to search for a noise texture. We're going to add the noise texture right in here and then we're going to be using the Node Wrangler, one of the features with the Node Wrangler. I'm going to press ctrl t with the noise texture selected and that adds this mapping and texture coordinate. Now I'm going to set the object into the mapping because this makes the noise texture be displayed on the sphere a bit better. And then using another feature on the Node Wrangler I can hold down ctrl and shift and click on the noise texture and now we can preview what it's showing. And that's the main feature of the Node Wrangler, you can just hold ctrl and shift and click on any node and preview what it's doing. So there's a few things that I want to do here. The scale here, I want to make this scale a little bit smaller so maybe around a 4.5, something like that. And then the detail here, I want to change this up to like maybe 10 to give it a lot more detail. The roughness, I want to just turn that up a little bit. And then the distortion right here, I want to change this up to maybe like a 0.3 just so that we have just a little bit of distortion, maybe even a 0.2, something like that. Okay now you can see that it's only white and black here, we want to change these colors so that they look a lot more like clay. So to do that I'm going to press shift a, I'm going to search for a color ramp node, just drop the color ramp node right here. Now this black value, I'm going to move this out and click on it, and I'm just going to make it a light tan, kind of light brown color. And you can really just play around with this and make any color you want, but if you want to use the exact color that I'm using, then you can click on this, click on the hex, and then the hex value that I'm using is A47B57. But you can totally just play around with this and make a color that you like. And then right over here, on the white here, I'm going to bring this out and then I'm just going to make this one kind of a dark brown color. And again if you want to use the same hex value that I'm using, I'm going to be using 26241B. So if you want to use the same color that I'm using, it's a slightly green color, kind of a dark brown green color. So to add that hex value, just click on it, click over on hex, and then you can just add in that number and it's going to be the exact same color as my one. Okay, and then I want to add another one, so I'm going to click on plus right here, kind of move this over like this, move it a little bit closer to the brown one, and then this one, I'm going to make it a bit of a more redder and a little bit darker color. Because clay usually has a little bit of red in it, just a little bit. And if you want to use the same color that I'm using, I'm going to be using 793922 on the hex value for that one. Now I do want to add one more color, just kind of a basic brown one. So I'll click on this plus, move this kind of into the middle, and then change this to just kind of a kind of orangey brown and a little bit more saturated. And again, if you want to use the exact color that I'm using, I'm going to be using 724D1D. Okay, so let's plug this color into the base color and then control shift and click on the principal. Now you can see that it's really shiny and clay isn't really this shiny unless maybe it's wet, but in this case we're making some dry clay that's kind of cracked a little bit. So on the roughness here, I'm going to change this to maybe like 0.8, and that'll make it a lot less shiny. Oh, and I forgot to change the HDRI, so let me just go ahead and do that. So this is the HDRI that I'm going to be using. I like the colors and I think it looks pretty nice. So it's the Pump House HDRI and it's only 1K, that's the resolution size. So again, if you want to download the same one that I'm using, the link will be in the video description. And I think I want to change the distortion on this a little bit higher, so maybe like a 0.4. That just adds a little bit more kind of warping there. All right, and then one more thing that I want to do to make the colors look just a little bit better is I want to add the RGB curves node. So what I'm going to do is press Shift-A and search for RGB curves. Just drop the RGB curves right in there. And then what I'm going to do is turn this C up a little bit. That'll make it just a little bit brighter. And then this R here, that's for red. I want to give it just a tad bit more red, but not very much, just a little bit. And then the green, maybe just a tiny bit less than the blue, just a tiny bit less. And I think I might give on the C here, just give a little curve, just give a little curve there. So if I just click on this and press M, you can see that's how it is without, and then M, and that's how it is with it. So I think it just makes it look a little bit nicer. Now you can see here that it's very smooth and we want to add some bump to this. So what I'm going to do is just grab this color right here, put it into the normal. Sorry, it's really small. Let me just make this a little bit smaller and this a little bit bigger so you can see what I'm doing. So I'm going to put this color here into the normal, but you can see that there's some shading issues and that's because we need to put it through a bump node to convert it to normal data. So I'm going to press Shift A, search for a bump node, just drop the bump node in right here. And then this normal here, I'm going to set this to height and that way it converts it properly. And you can see here now it's really strong, but this is too strong. So the strength here, I'm going to change this to maybe like 0.1, maybe 0.15. And now it looks a bit better. Okay. And then let's go ahead and make the cracks. So what I'm going to do is press Shift A, search for another noise texture, add that in. And then with it selected, I'm going to press Control T using the Node Wrangler feature. I'm going to plug the color into the vector on the mapping there. And then if I Control Shift and click on this, I can see what it's doing. Now, right now it's way too big and I want to make it smaller. So I'm just going to scale this down a little bit. So I think I'll change the scale of somewhere around 3.5, something like that, but you can definitely change it later. And then let's add a color ramp. So I'm going to press Shift A, search for a color ramp node. We'll just drop this right here in the center. And then I'm going to drag this black value in and drag the white value out. And what this is going to do is it's going to give a lot of high contrast to the sphere. And then what we can do with this once we bring it in. Okay, that looks pretty good. I think I'll make this a little bit smaller though, maybe around 3, something like that, but you can definitely change that to your liking. What I'm going to do now is press Shift A, search for a math node. We'll just drop this in here. And then right here on the add, I'm going to change this to warp. And you can see now it's just taking those edges and making it white and then making everything else black. So just make sure they're really close to each other so that it's pretty small. Now what we're going to do is we're going to put this through a bump node and tell the black to be just normal and the white is going to go in. So what I'm going to do is this bump node here, I'm going to press Shift D and duplicate it and just drop it right down here. And I think I'll just move these up a little bit. So now what we can do is we can take this warp, plug this into the height. And this is what you do if you want to add multiple bump maps on top of each other. What you do is you have the first one here and you can see that I'm plugging the RGB curves up to the height here. And then the second one, I press Shift D, I duplicated this and you put the normal into the normal and then you want to add another one. So you take the warp and you plug that into the height. And now you can see if I control shift and click on this and then this, turn the strength up a little bit so you can see it. And now you can see it's adding those cracks on top of the previous one. Now you can see that the cracks are coming out, but we want them to be going back in. So to change this, I can click on the invert node and now you can see they're going in. You can see right there. And then they're a little too strong right now, so I'm going to change this to maybe like a 0.3 or something like that. And then let's control shift and click on this and you can see it's looking a lot better. Okay, so now I want to add two more normal maps or two more layers of bump. I want to add some larger detail and some smaller detail. So what I'm going to do is click on this noise texture and then hold down shift and click on this one and this one. So I have those three selected and then I'll press shift d to duplicate them. Just bring them over here. And then this bump node, I'm just going to select this. Actually not this one because this has the invert. I'll just grab this one, press shift d, move it over and then just drop it in right there. And then this factor, I'm going to plug into the height. Now if I control shift and click on this, you can see what it's doing. It's adding in those really big bumps. Now that's actually too big. I want to make it smaller, like bigger bumps. So this I'm going to change to something around maybe one or actually maybe like two and see what it's doing. And that way just adds a little more variation, gives some big bumps. And then you can just change to something, maybe 0.2, something like that. Okay, and then I want to do it one more time, but this time I want to have some really tiny detail. I will again click on this, shift d, drop it in here. And then I want to select this, shift, select this and this and press shift d to duplicate that. And then I can just grab this and pull it up and then I'll plug the factor of this into the height. Now this one, if I can control shift and click on it, I want it to be really small, lots of detail. So I'll bring this way up to maybe something like a 25 or something like that. And then click on it and you can see it's adding in all that detail right there. But right now it's way too strong. So I'm going to change it to like a 0.1. Now I do think that this maybe is a tiny bit too red. So I think I'll actually bring this down a little bit and the green, I might just turn up a tiny bit to make it a little bit more yellow, but it's totally up to you. Of course you can make it look however you want. So now what I'm going to do is render this out. I can press F12 to render it, or you can also go right up here and click on render and render image. And you can see it's finished now. One more thing that I'm going to do is just go into the compositor and add a denoise node just to denoise the image a bit. So I'm going to go over to this compositing tab and I'll click on use nodes. And then you should have already a render layers node and a composite node, and they should be connected up just like this. And then if I control shift and click on the render layers, that's going to add a viewer right here. So now what I need to do is just add a denoise node in between so that it denoises the image. Also the background here, you can press a V to zoom that out if it's way too big and alt V to zoom it in. And if you don't see that backdrop, it's probably because you need to click on this button. Okay. So press shift a, I'm going to search for the denoise node, drop it in here and then connect it up to the viewer and compositing. And then to save this image, let's click back on the rendering tab. And then this might be at render result. What you need to do is click on the viewer node in this dropdown here. And then that way it's going to show the, uh, denoised image. So then I can go right here and click on image and just click on save as image and save the image to your computer. So that's going to be it for this tutorial. If you want to download the project files, they are going to be available on my gumroad and my patron, and it'll also help to support me, but thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in a future video."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzJnsqIRbDw,How to Make Procedural Snow in Blender ❄️ (Tutorial),"In this Blender tutorial, Ryan King demonstrates how to create a procedural snow material using Blender's shader nodes. The tutorial involves adding a Voronoi texture for icy details, using a color ramp to adjust colors to resemble snow, and introducing bump maps for texture. He also explains how to use a displace modifier to add lumpiness to the snow and suggests using the Node Wrangler add-on for efficiency. The project files are available on his Gumroad and Patreon.","It's cold. Hey everyone this is Ryan King and in this quick blender tutorial I'm going to show you how to make this procedural snow in blender. And this tutorial had better be quick because I'm getting cold. Okay so let's jump into blender now and get started. I should probably take this off. Alright and before we start I wanted to say that if you want to download the project files they're going to be available on my gumroad and my patreon. So as I said this is going to be a completely procedural material we're only going to be using blender's shader nodes but I am going to be using an HDRI to get some nice realistic lighting and I also have a few lights on this sphere here. Now how I made this sphere is I press shift A and I added an icosphere. Then on the icosphere settings right behind me you can just change up this subdivision. So I changed it up to something like 7 or 6 and then you can just shade that smooth. And why I subdivided this so high is because we're going to be adding a displacement modifier to make the snow all lumpy. And one last thing I'm going to be using the node wrangler add-on while I'm making this so if you don't have that enabled you can go edit and go to preferences and then on the add-ons here just search for node wrangler and then enable that and I'll show you what that does in a moment. Alright so I just added a quick material right here and it just has a principled shader on it. So the first thing that we're going to do is press shift A and I'm going to add a Verona texture and I'm going to set the scale to something around 4.5 but you can change this if you want. Then with this Verona texture selected I'm going to press control T and that's using one of the features in the node wrangler and it gives us this mapping and texture coordinate. What I'm going to do is just take this object and plug it into the vector. Now if I control shift and click on the Verona texture you can preview what it's doing to the sphere. Now what I'm going to do is duplicate the Verona texture so just select it and press shift D and I'm just going to move it down here. Then I'm also going to plug the mapping up to the vector on that one as well. Now I'm going to change this from F1 to F2 because I think that looks a bit nicer and I'm also going to change this to Manhattan. Now let's control shift and click on this Verona texture so that we can see what it's doing and I want to change the scale up a lot more so that it's a lot smaller and I'm going to change this to something maybe around 50 somewhere around there and you can see if I zoom in it's giving this nice little icy detail. So now I want to mix these two Verona textures together. So I'm going to press shift A and I'm going to search for a mix RGB. Just drop it in there and then plug them both up with the distance to the colours. And you can see what it's doing now. It has that little icy detail but because we have these big spots here it's giving some areas with more contrast. Now if I plug this mix into the base colour and then control shift click on the base colour you can see that now it's starting to look like snow but you can see that it's really black in those areas of contrast. And snow is usually white and blue because it's made up of frozen water. So what I'm going to do is make this black colour blue instead. So I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for a colour ramp node. Just drop the colour ramp node in between these two nodes and then this black one right here I'm just going to make it a very light blue. And you can see now it's definitely looking a lot more like snow. Now snow is usually very reflective because it's usually wet and icy. So this roughness value right here I'm going to change this down to 0.1. You can see now it's really shiny. But this snow material doesn't have any bump and so what I'm going to do is just select all of these and move them over. And then what I'm going to do is plug this colour into the normal to give it some bump. Now you can see it looks really weird. This is a shading issue and this is because we haven't converted the colour which is yellow to the normal which is purple. So we need to give it a node to convert it to normal data. So I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for a bump node. Just drop the bump node right in here in between these connections and then plug this up to the height. Now this bump is way too high so I'm going to turn it way down. So change it to something like maybe a 0.1, something like that. But it still looks a bit simple so I want to give it even more detail. So what I'm going to do is shift D the bump to duplicate it and just drop it in right there. Then I'll press shift A and I'm going to search for a noise texture. And just drop the noise texture down here. Now I'm going to take that mapping and plug the mapping into the vector of the noise texture. Now I'm going to change the scale to something around 4 and then if I control shift and click on it you can see what it's doing. It has some parts that are lighter and some parts are darker. I'm going to plug the mapping into the vector right there and you can see now it's a little bit smaller. You can change the scale around to something that you like. And then I'm going to plug the factor into the height on the bump. And if you plug it into the height here you can see this bump is connected to the normal and then this one is connected to the height. So if I control shift and click on this now, now you can see that it's adding these two together. So you can see there's a little tiny detail and then there's also the bigger lumpier detail. And I want to make this one a little bit bigger so maybe I'll change it to something like 0.2 on the strength there. And now if I control shift click back on the principled you can see it's a bit more bumpy and looks nicer. So let's just do this one more time. I'm going to press shift D on the bump, drop it down here. Now I'm going to grab this noise texture, duplicate it and just put it over here. And then I want to plug this noise texture up to the mapping again. So I'll just drag this all the way over and drop it into the vector here. And then because I want this to be really high detail I'm going to change this to something really high like maybe 170 or something like that. And then I also want to change this detail way up so I'm going to change it to the max which is 16. And then if we control shift and click on it you can see that now it has a lot of really really small detail. And now I'll just plug the factor up to this height here and now you can see it's adding all of these three together. It's adding in this icy detail, it's adding in the bigger lumps and then it's also adding the really tiny detail. So now if we control shift and click on the principled you can see if we zoom in here it has a lot more bump and some really nice detail. So this is looking pretty nice. I definitely think it looks like snow but it's not very lumpy around the edges because you can see it's just a sphere here. So what I'm going to do is just make sure the sphere is selected and I'm going to go to the modifiers tab and then I'll click on add modifier and add a displace modifier. Now you can see it just makes it look like it's bigger. What we want to do is add a texture to tell it where it's being displaced. So we can click on this new button right here and it's going to add a texture. Then we can click on this little button over here and that's going to take us to the texture panel. Now right now it's set to image or movie. I just want to select it and change it to clouds. It's way too strong right now but we can fix that. I'm just going to change the size. Whatever you want. You could make it smaller or you could make it bigger. It really depends on what you're doing. And then let's go back over and click on the wrench right here to get to the modifiers and I'm going to change the strength to something really small. So I'm going to change it to maybe 0.15 and you can see now that it's not blown way too big. If I zoom in you can see right here on the edges it's all lumpy and bumpy and random. And here we have the finished snow procedural material. So I hope you enjoyed this quick blender tutorial and I hope it was helpful. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in a future video."
