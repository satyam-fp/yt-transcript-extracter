https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leuKvqbYyiY,Procedural Stylized Wireframe Material (Blender Tutorial),"The video tutorial demonstrates how to create a procedural stylized wireframe material in Blender, which can be applied to models to create a techy or futuristic effect. The tutorial covers two versions of the wireframe material: one that emits light and another that allows for customizable colors. The video provides step-by-step instructions on setting up the material, including adjusting wireframe thickness, brightness, and noise effects. It also highlights how to create a node group for easy customization and offers links for purchasing these materials or accessing additional resources for creating procedural materials in Blender.","in this tutorial I'll show you how to create this procedural stylized wireframe material in blender so this material could be really useful for example adding it onto a car model to kind of add a cool techy effect to the spinning car you could also add it to other abstract or scii renders now this wireframe Shader doesn't actually show the correct topology of the mesh you can see here's the actual topology of the mesh now the monkey does have a subdivision surface modifier but you can see the wireframe Shader is going to add these triangles here in the face is so if you want to learn how to render proper wireframe images then you can check out this other video which I made and I'll have the link to that in the description but this is more of a stylized kind of futuristic wireframe effect that you can add to objects now we're going to be creating two different versions so the first version is a wireframe emission so the wireframe is actually going to emit light and then the other one here is just this base wireframe which you can change the custom colors so we have this base color here and we also have the roughness of the material and then we also have this cool wireframe thickness you can make it thicker or thin depending on what you're working on and then we also have the wireframe brightness for the emission because it's emitting light and then we also have the wireframe color which is that emission color then we also have this cool noise value here so if I turn up this noise amount you can see there's going to be bits of noise where the wireframe disappears and then we have the noise scale we also have the detail level of the noise and then we also have the roughness value of the noise and then also noise Distortion so for this one again we have the base color we also have the wireframe color then we also have the roughness of the material and then again we have the wireframe thickness and then again we have similar noise values so we have the noise amount and then we have the scale we also have the detail we also have the roughness and then also the Distortion and if you'd like to purchase these procedural materials you can get them with the links in the description you can also purchase all of my procedural materials by checking out my ultimate blender procedural material pack which comes with all of my procedural materials preset up for blender's asset browser with custom thumbnails sorted catalogs and customizable node group now every time I create another 10 procedural materials I update the ultimate material pack with all of my new materials and so I've just finished these next materials so these materials have just been added to my ultimate procedural material pack and to learn how to create more materials you can check out my blender procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube so real quick I'll show you what I have set up in the 3D viewport if you want to set it up the same way that I have so I just went to the add menu and I just added a monkey head and I scaled it down by a point 2 and then hit R A and just appli the scale then I hit ctrl1 to add a subdivision surface with one level and I'll make the viewport and render levels both one and then I'll just shade it smooth then I'll move this over here and duplicate it so we have two different monkeys to preview both materials let's set up the lighting so if I go here to the World Properties I'm going to be adding in this machine shop 02 HD from poly haven.com so if you want to download it the link is in the description and I downloaded the 1K HDR version so once you download the hdri you can click on this yellow yellow dot here next to color and you can choose environment texture and then just click on the open button and open up the hdri and I went up here to the render properties and I opened up the film Tab and I just check marked the transparent button so you can't see the HD in the background and then also here on the color management I'm using HX and very high contrast to make the colors more contrasted so let's click over here to go to the shading workspace and I'll just select the first monkey head I'll go into the rendered viewport mode and then I'll click on new here to add a new material in the shape editor and I'll just call this wireframe emission we're going to be creating the emission wireframe first and then I will also be using the node Wrangler add-on so you can click here on edit and you can go to the preferences and then go to the add-ons Tab and just search for node and just enable the node Wrangler add-on so I'm going to start by making this a dark blue color and if you want to use the same exact hex value you can punch in this hex value right here I'm just going to make it a nice dark blue color then I'm going to turn the roughness down so I'll just turn the roughness down to like a0 2 so it's kind of shiny now the main node that we're going to use to create this effect is the wireframe node so if you go to the add menu you can add the wireframe node and if I control shift and select the wireframe I can preview it what I'm going to do is open up the emission here and I'm going to put the factor into the strength and then I'll control shift select the principal Shader to preview it so now wherever the wireframe is that is going to make it an emission and then I can also drag this size here down so I can make it smaller but you can see it's really hard to drag this value because the value is so sensitive so to make the size less sensitive so it's easier to change the size I'm going to search for a math node and we'll put the math node here behind the wireframe and the value is going to go into the size so we're replacing that value now here on the type here I'm going to change it to divide so now on the Top Value I'll turn it to one and on the bottom value I'm going to turn it to 1,000 so this way we can now use the Top Value and I can drag it back and forth and you can see we can very easily have more customizable control over the size of it now the wireframe Shader is going into the strength of the emission and so we don't actually have any value to change the brightness so what I'm going to do is click on the divide and I'll duplicate it and stick it here and then instead of divide I'm going to change it to multiply instead and then on this value here I'll just turn it to a one on default but now I can turn this value and that's going to multiply the color values and so it's going to make it brighter and brighter so we can use this in the custom node group to make the emission brighter and then of course if you want to right here on the color on the emission color you can change the emission color right there but I'll just leave it as a white color so now I want to add that cool noise effect so that some parts can be taken away by noise so I'm just going to search for a noise texture and we're just going to drop it up here and then with the noise texture selected I'll hit contrl T to add the texture coordinate mapping and I can just delete the mapping and then let's put the object into the vector and the object coordinates will place the texture on the object more evenly and let's control shift select the noise texture to preview it and let's now change some of the settings so I'm going to turn the scale to 20 and I'll turn the detail up to 10 so it's pretty detailed and then I'll turn the roughness up to A6 so I do want to make it more contrasted so let's go to the ad menu and I'm just going to search for a color amp and let's stick it here after the noise and for now I'll just kind of drag these together so it's more contrasty we'll be customizing this later so now what I want to do is I want to mix the color ramp in here with the wireframe and I want to make it so that where the noise is the wireframe is going to disappear so to do this I'm going to search for a mix color to mix two colors together so we're going to take the color amp and put that into the factor and then the multiply can go into color a now here in color B we can just make this fully black so now I can take this mix result and I can replace it here for the strength so now this is going to be the new color so let's just control shift select the principal Shader and now you can see that where the noise is if I control shift select it you can see like right here this is really bright so wherever the noise is going to be really bright that's where it's going to be disappearing so I'll just control shift select the principled Shader just to see that again now I do want to customize this a little bit so what I'm going to do is on the color ramp here I'm going to drag this over a bit and then also drag the white tab over a little bit I like something like that a little bit better but then also I want to be able to control the visibility of the noise because maybe I just don't want to use the noise in some cases so what I can do is add a hue saturation value node and we'll put it here after the color now the Hue saturation value has this value which I can turn up and down so I'll just control shift selected to preview it so if I turn the value down it's going to be fully black so now you can see that it's showing all the wireframe but if I turn the value up and make it lighter more and more of it is going to be white and so more and more of it is going to be disappeared so I'll turn the value all the way to zero on default but in the custom node group we can turn this up to kind of add that cool effect so now let's join this together into a node group so I'm going to click and drag to box select all the nodes except the material output and I'll hit control G to join together into a node group let's hit tab to go out of the node group I'll just drag it over here let's make it bigger and I can copy the material name and add it here into the node group let's hit tab to go into the node group and I'll hit the end key to open up the side panel and then if I go over here to the group tab we have the group sockets and so I can double click on this to rename it and I'll just rename it to Shader because I like that better so now we can plug up all the custom values to this group input to control them outside of the new so the first value that I want to add is the base color so we'll drag the group input right over here next to the principal Shader we'll put the base color and also let's put the roughness into the extra sockets then let's control the wireframe thickness so I'm going to drag the group input right back here and this value can control the thickness so put the value under the extra socket we'll double click on this to rename it and I'll just rename that to wireframe thickness then to control the wireframe brightness we have the multiply so we'll put this into the extra socket and this one I'm going to rename two wireframe bright then for the wireframe color we can drag this over here next to the principal Shader and we'll put the color into the extra socket and you could leave this to emission color I'm going to call it wireframe color or you could call it wireframe emission color whatever makes sense for you then let's control the noise amount so I'll drag the group input under the color ramp and we have this value that we can control how much noise so we'll put the value into the extra socket and I'll just rename this to noise amount then I want to control the noise settings so I'll drag the group input put back here behind the noise and I'll put the scale the detail the roughness and the Distortion all into the extra sockets and then if I drag this down I'm going to copy the word noise here and then I can paste it here so we have noise scale paste it here noise detail noise roughness and noise Distortion so I'll hit the end key to close the side panel let's just drag this maybe up here and I'll hit tab to go out of the no group and I can just review the material to make sure it's working so we first have the base color that's looking good then we have the roughness of the material we also have the wireframe thickness we have the wireframe brightness and then also the wireframe color and then we have the noise amount so I'll turn this up so I can see the noise and then I also have the noise scale the detail also the roughness and the Distortion so I'll turn the noise amount back to zero so that is it for the first material so I'm now just going to duplicate this material and add it to the other monkey and we'll be creating another one which is similar but isn't in a mission so just select the other monkey head we'll click on the drop down and we're we're just going to add the same material but I now want to duplicate the material so that when we change the settings it won't affect the other material so to do this we need to do two things first I'm going to click right here to duplicate the Shader or the entire material so now it says wire from emission 001 I'm just going to get rid of that so we have just the base wireframe however this wireframe node group is the same node group right in here so if I change the values it would affect the other material so I need to click on this two icon click on the two and that's going to duplicate it so it's now separate and I'm just going to call it wireframe so let's hit the Tab Key to go into the node group and I'm just going to change some of the settings so because this material isn't going to be emission let's go over here to the emission and I'm going to unplug the color and unplug the strength of the emission make sure the strength is turned to zero and we can just close the emission now if I hit the end key to open up the side panel let's drag this down and make it bigger we don't want to use the wireframe color so we'll click on this this is the emission one so click on that and then hit the minus to get rid of it and then we also don't need this multiply because this multiply node here was used to make it brighter so if I click on the multiply I'll hit crl X to get rid of it so crl X will get rid of the value but still keep this wire plugged up so now you can see we have this extra value here the wireframe brightness so I click on the wireframe brightness we'll hit the minus to get rid of it now I also want to get rid of the base color because we're going to be creating two separate custom colors so here on the base color just click on the base color here and hit the minus to get rid of that as well so if I just control shift select the mix here you can see this mix color has white and black for the wireframe in the background so let's click on the principal Shader and we're just going to drag it back here and then I'll just control shift select the principal Shader so the viewer isn't in the way so this mix here I can put the mix result into the color so now you can see we have black and white but I want to create custom colors for this so I'll go to the ad menu and I'm just going to search for another mix color and we're going to put this here after the first one now because this mixed result is black and white we can put it into the factor and that's going to determine what part is going to be color a and what part is going to be color B so then I'm going to make two different custom colors and I kind of like using these brownish grayish colors so for color a I'm going to be using this mid- gray color and you can punch in the hex value if you want to use the same color and also on color B this is going to be kind of like a dark brown and again you can punch in the same hex value if you want to get the exact same color I'm using so now just make sure the mixed result is going into the base color let's just kind of compress these together so it looks a little bit better so I now want to add those new colors as custom colors so I'll click on the group input and let's just drag it right up here we'll zoom in here and I can now take color a put that into the extra socket and color B put that into the extra socket and let's double click on a and this is going to be the base color cuz this is the light one and then here in color B I'll double click on this to rename it and call it wireframe color so now I'm going to click on the base color and I'm going to drag it up to the top and let go so base colors is at the top and then click and drag and drop the wireframe right after that so you have the base color and wireframe there at the very top now let's click in the group input and just drag it back to the very end and let's zoom into the color ramp and for this material I actually like the color ramp being more contrasty I think it just looks better for the noise so I'm going to drag these values really close to each other kind of like that kind of in the middle so it's going to be more contrasted so let's hit the Tab Key to go outside the node group I'll hit end to close the side panel and then we still have that viewer node plugged up so just control shift select the principled Shader to preview the final thing so we have the base color of the material then we also have the wireframe color and then we also have the roughness of the material we also have the wireframe thickness and then we have the noise amount so I'll turn up the noise and then we also have the noise scale the noise detail the noise roughness and the noise Distortion so that's how you create these two procedural stylized wireframe materials you can also purchase these procedural materials on my gumro store and patreon page and that's a great way to help support the channel now I've just finished creating all of these new materials so these materials have just been added into my ultimate procedural material pack so if you're an existing customer you can redownload the product files and reinstall it as an asset library to get the updates with these new materials you can also just purchase this new proced dral material pack so if you're interested in that link is in the description and you can also check out my proced dral material tutorial playlist to learn how to create many more materials so I hope you found this helpful and thank you for watching"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3lyfrWlx3E,Procedural Rubber Materials - Part 2 (Blender Tutorial),"In part two of this Blender tutorial, the creator demonstrates how to make grippy and dotted rubber materials procedurally. The video builds on the previous tutorial, which covered creating bumpy and smooth rubber materials. The tutorial details the steps to design these materials, including using noise and Voronoi textures, setting up node groups, and customizing properties such as color, roughness, and bump strength. The creator also offers options to purchase these materials individually or as part of an ultimate procedural material pack through various online platforms, with links provided in the video description.",welcome to part two of this two-part tutorial on how to create procedural rubber materials and blender so if you haven't seen the first part definitely check that out with the link in the description in the first part we created these two materials we created the bumpy rubber material and the smooth rubber material and in this video we're going to be creating the grippy rubber material and also this dotted rubber material and if you'd like to purchase these materials to use in your projects you can get that with the links in the description on mger store and patreon page and the blend market and if you'd like to purchase all of my procedual materials you can check out my ultimate blender procedual material pack which comes with all of my materials preset up for blender asset browser with custom thumbnails sorted catalogs and customizable node groups so once you've set up my ultimate material pack as an asset library in the blender you can just drag and drop the procedural materials into your 3D project and you can also purchase any of my materials individually on my G store and you can also check out my procedural material tutorial playlist here on YouTube to learn how to create any of my materials now as far as the 3D setup goes for this 3D scene if you want to set up the same way that I have then check out part one if you haven't watched part one yet then check that out and I go over kind of the lighting setup and how I've set up the 3D scene so let's now make the grippy rubber material so I'm just going to select this object and I'll duplicate it and I'll just move it right down here and then if I just select these other objects I'll hit the H key to hide them just so they're out of the way so the viewport is a bit faster when we're rendering and then if I select this object here let's click on the X to get rid of that material we'll add a new material and this one we'll rename to grippy rubber so let's start by creating the main texture which is going to go into the base color so I'll go to the ad menu we're going to search for a noise texture we'll drop this here and with the noise texture selected I'll hit contrl T to add the texture coordinate and mapping and I'll use the object coordinates and I'll just place the texture coordinate mapping down here and put the noise texture up here so now I want to control shift select the noise texture so I can preview it and let's change some of the settings so I'm going to turn the scale to 100 20 and then I'll turn the detail up to a six so I want to put the factor into the base color but before I do that I want to create some custom colors so I'll go to the ad menu and I'll search for a mix color I'll put this after the noise and the factor can go into the factor of the mix this way we have color a and color B and so if I change this that's going to be the custom colors to add some variation to the rubber material and if you want to use the same exact colors that I'm using you can use the same hex codes so for color a this is going to be a gray color and it's going to be six 3es so 3 three 3 3 3 three FF and the FF that's just for the alpha cuz you can see if I drag this that's Turing the alpha so we want the alpha to be all the way up to one then here for color B this is going to be a very dark gray and for this one the hex code is going to be one n 1 9 1 9 FF so now I can take this mix result and I can put that into the base color and let's control shift select the principal Shader to preview it and then just for now I'll turn the roughness up a it so it's a bit more rough but we're going to be adding a value into the roughness later so now let's create the main texture for the grippy part of the rubber so I'll go to the ad menu and I'm going to search for a voro texture and let's use the same object coordinate so we put the mapping Vector into the vector the voro and I'll control shift select the voro to preview it and then let's change the settings so on the F1 here I'm going to change this to distance to Edge and now if I turn up the scale you can see we have this cool crack texture so I'm going to turn the scale to 800 so it's really detailed and then I'll leave the other settings how they are now I want to distort the voro texture with another texture so I'm going to search for a noise texture and we're going to drop it right here between the mapping and the voro so you can see it's distorting the voro because it's going through the vector and let's change some of the settings so I'll turn the scale to a 25 and I'll turn the detail up to six and leave the other settings how they are now if I zoom in here you can see it's like way too distorted so I want the noise texture to have less of an effect over the voro so to do this we're going to search for a mix color and we're going to drop it here between the noise texture and the voro and I can unplug this and I'm going to put the factor into color B and then I'm going to take this mapping vector and I'm going to put that into color a so now this mix is mixing between a which isn't distorted and B which is very distorted now you can see as I drag this around the texture is moving around a lot so we'll click on the mix type here and we'll change it to linear light and that way when I drag this around you can see it's distorting it but it's not moving it around quite so much and then I'll turn the factor to a 02 just a 02 so now you can see it looks kind of random and noisy so that just makes it look a bit more natural so now this voro texture is going to go into the normal let's control shift select the principal Shader and I first want to add a color ramp to change the colors and make it more contrasted so I'm going to search for a color ramp we'll put this here and let's just control shift select the color amp to preview it and the voro distance can go into the factor of the color ramp so I'm going to drag the white tab way over here and then leave the black tab here so now you can see it's mostly white and so basically by dragging this white over it's making those little black lines a lot more thin so now I can put the color into the normal and I'll control shift select the principal Shader to preview it but you can see there's some weird shading issues it's really dark over here that's because we need to convert the color data into normal data so we're going to search for a bump node we're going to drop this here and the color can go into the height value and now it's converted to bump data and I'm going to turn the strength to a really small number of a25 just a 025 so if I zoom in here you can see it just looks a little bit bumpy so let's click and drag to box slick these nodes and I'm going to drag them down and box s these nodes and drag them up because I want to add a roughness value so what we're going to do is drag this noise texture up here and we're actually going to put the noise texture into the roughness but what I first want to do is change the colors so we're going to search for a color ramp drop this up here and I'll put the factor into the roughness but then let's take the color ramp and put it in between the noise and the roughness so now I can take the white tabs and black tabs and turn them up and down to control the roughness values so on this one here I'm going to leave it as fully white but then the black one here I'm going to turn this up and you can see if I turn it up it's going to be more rough and if you want to use the same exact hex code I'm using this color here is going to to be a color of 94 94 94 FF there on the hex code and then also I want to be able to control the roughness values later in the custom node group so if we just search for a hue saturation value we can put this in between the color amp and the principal Shader and we now have this value which I can drag up and down so that's going to make the values lighter and darker so that's going to control the roughness values so that's it for the procedural material so let's now join together into a node group so I'll click and drag to B select all the nodes accept the material output and I'll press contrl G to join together into a node group and then I'll hit the tab keyer outside the node group and I'll drag the node group over here and let's make it bigger and I can copy the material name and I can paste it here into the node group now also you can see this says bsdf and I want to rename that to Shader so if I go into the node group I can press the end key to open up the side panel and if I go here to the group Tab and the group sockets I can double click on this and just rename that to Shader so now on the group input we can plug up all the custom values so the mapping is plugged up to all the textures so this scale will change the size of the entire material so I'll put the scale into the extra socket let's click on the scale and you can see it's three values but to make it one value we can click on the type here and change it to float now we can turn the default value to one but the texture is still gone that's because I need to go Tab out of the node group and then I need to turn the scale back to one so now that's controlling the size of the entire material so we'll hit tab to go back into the new group now I also want to control the colors so I'll drag the group input right up here and we can can take color a and color B and put them into the extra sockets and then I'll just rename these to color one and two then I want to control the roughness so if I take the Hue saturation value take the value here and put that into the extra socket I can rename this to roughness then I want to control the texture scale so we'll drag the group input right down here let's take the voro we'll put the scale into the extra socket and I can rename this to texture scale then I want to control the texture Distortion which is controlled by this linear light because if I turn this up and down it's distorting the texture so we'll put this into the extra socket and I'll rename that to texture Distortion let's also add the detail of the voro so put the detail into the extra socket I'll drag this down here and let's rename it to texture detail then I want to control the noise scale and the noise detail so I'll drag the rub input right up here and we have this scale and this detail so we'll put both of these into the extra sockets and then I'm just going to call this noise scale and noise detail and then finally I want to control the bump strength so we'll drag the your input right down here let's take the strength put that into the extra socket and I'll rename this to bump strength so I'll drag the group input right up here and I'll hit the end key to close the side panel and I'll hit the Tab Key to go outside the node so here's the final material so let's open this up make it bigger and I can just review the final material so we have the overall scale of the texture then we also have the two different colors so color one and also color two and then we also have the roughness to make it more shiny or rough then we also have just the texture scale the texture Distortion we also have the detail so if I zoom in really close you can see if I turn up the detail that's what it's going to look like like and then we also have the noise scale which is controlling the noise of the color then we have the noise detail and then finally the bump strength so now let's create the last material which is the dotted rubber so I'm going to click on the grippy rubber here or click on the object and I'll duplicate it and move it over here we'll select this object and hit H to hide it and we'll click on this object here let's kind of zoom into it like that and I'll click on the X here to get rid of this material let's add a new material and I can call this dotted rubber so our first going to start by making the base color this dark gray color and if you want to use the same hex value you can punch in 26 26 26 FF so it's just kind of like a dark gray and then here on the roughness I'm going to turn this to a 6 so it's a bit more rough so let's now create the texture for the dots so I'll go to the ad menu and we're going to search for a voro texture drop this here and I'll control shift select the voro to preview it and then also with the voro texture selected I'll press contrl T to add the texture coordinate mapping now I could use the object object coordinates but if I put the object into the vector then what I want to do to make it look like dots is I'm going to take the F1 and change it to smooth F1 now you can see the edges are smooth and then I can turn up the scale so I'll just turn this down like that now if I take the random value here at the bottom and I turn this down to zero you can see there's a problem here and that's because this procedural texture has 3D texture space so you're seeing little slices of the circles in different areas and that's because this object is three-dimensional and so I wouldn't want to actually use the object coordinates in this case I'd want to use the UV coordinates instead so I'm going to put the UV into the vector so if you're going to use the UV coordinates you'll just need to make sure you properly UV and wrap your object so because we're UV unwrapping it the texture is now laying flat on the faces of the object so now here on the voro settings we already changed the smooth F1 and then we already turned the random to zero but let's turn the scale up to a 200 so the dots are much smaller so I now want to make the dots more contrasted so let's search for a color ramp we'll put this here after the voro and then I can drag the black tab kind of to about here and then I'll drag the white tab over to the other side and I'll just bring it to about there so now you can see there's these little white circles with black behind it so we're going to be putting this into the normal to give it some bump so we'll drag these nodes back here let's search for a bump node we'll drop it down here so we can first take the color color and put that into the normal and then if I control shift select the principal Shader you can see there's some weird shading issues so I need to put the bump here in between the color and the principal and then the color needs to be going into the height value to convert it to bump data so now you can see we have some little bumps there on the Rubber and I'm going to turn the bump strength down to like a04 so it's not quite as bumpy now I also want to be able to control the size of the bumps so let's drag the voro and colorant back here and in between these two nodes I'm going to search for a hue saturation value and we'll put this right here so it's after the voro so the value here we can drag this up and down and that is going to make it lighter and darker so that is going to change the size of each individual Little Dot there so then I also want to add a noise texture which is also going to be going into the bump just to make the Surface more bumpy so let's just search for a noise texture drop this up here and I can use the same Vector put that into the vector the noise and then I'll control shift select the noise to preview it and let's change some of the settings so I'll turn the scale to 40 and I'll turn the detail to 10 and I'll turn the roughness to 8.6 so I now want to go over here to the principal Shader and drag this back and I'm going to take the bump node and I'll duplicate it and drop it here and we can put the noise texture factor into the height value of this bump and then let's control shift select the principal Shader to preview it so now you can see we're mixing it together because we have two bump nodes now that is way too bumpy so I want to make this much less strong so I'm going to turn the bump strength just to a06 06 so now if I zoom in here you can see there's just a little bit of bumpiness there on the Rubber and that is it for the procedural material so let's join together into a node group now I don't want to put the texture coordinate into the node group because when I add this in my ultimate procedural material pack I want my customers to know that it's using the UV coordinates so they'll have to UV unra the object if they want to add it onto some object or they could also use the object coordinates if they're just using like a flat object but what I'm going to do is BLX select all these nodes except the material output and the Textra coordinate I'll hit contrl G to join together into a node group and I'll hit the Tab Key to go outside the node group and we can just drag these nodes together to compress them let's also drag this out to make it bigger and then I can copy the material name and paste it here into the new node group let's hit the Tab Key to go into the node group and I'll hit the end key to open up the side panel and here on the group sockets here I just want to double click on this and rename it to Shader because I like that better so now let's plug up all the custom values so we'll plug the scale here from the mapping into the extra socket if we click on the scale let's click on the type here and change it to float so it is one value and then we can turn the default value to one let's go out of the node group and turn the scale back to one and then we can go back into the node group now let's also control a base color and the roughness so I'm going to drag the grp input over here and we'll put the base color and the roughness into the extra sockets now I also want to control the size of the dots so we'll drag this back here and we can take this value from the Hue saturation value and'll put that into the actual socket and this one I'm going to rename to dots size then let's control the dot scale so we'll put the vorno texture scale into the extra socket and we'll rename this to dot scale and actually what I'm going to do is click and drag and drop the dots size after this one so this one is below it and then this one I'll re name to dots individual size cuz that makes more sense then I want to control the noise settings so we'll put the scale and the detail into the extra socket and I'll call this noise scale and noise detail and then I want to control the bump strengths so we'll drag group input right down here and if we zoom in here this first one is the dots bump strength so we'll put this one in the extra socket let's rename this one here to dots bump strength and then the last one here we'll put the strength into the extra socket this one as you can see is the noise so I'll put this into the extra socket and this one I'll rename to noise bump string I'll hit the end key to close the side panel let's drag the group input right back here and I can hit tab to go outside the node group let's just zoom out here and review the final material so we have the scale change the size of the entire material you can also use the object coordinates if you want to and let me just show you real quick if I just like add a plane maybe scale the plane down and apply the scale if I now add this same material to a flat object here like a plane you can see using the object coordinates it actually looks just fine so if you're adding this to a flat object you can use the object coordinates but for an object like this which is round I'm going to be using the UV coordinates instead so we have the scale then we also have the base color so I'm just keeping it gray that makes sense for rubber then we have the roughness we have the dot scale that's all the dots at once and then we have the dots individual size then we have the noise scale we also have the noise detail and then we have the dots bump strength and the noise bump strength so I'm just going to press alt H to bring back all the objects here just zoom in here to all the objects and there we go so there is the four procedural rubber materials so that's will be it for this video so I hope you enjoyed this I hope you found it helpful and thank you for watching you can also purchase these procedural materials on my G Ro store and patreon page and the blender Market links are in the description and you can also purchase all my materials with my ultimate blender procedural material pack and to learn how to
